In rural regions of the country, malnourished and sick children are being turned away from overcrowded clinics, while families are forced to drink from contaminated water sources. The situation has been exacerbated by recent natural disasters, including devastating floods that have displaced entire communities. Despite the efforts of relief organizations on the ground, government officials have been slow to respond to the growing crisis, leading to accusations of neglect. Local activists are calling for urgent action from international bodies to ensure that these vulnerable communities receive the support they urgently need.", "New Delhi India continues to face a significant threat from terrorism and security threats, as extremist groups operating within the country and beyond seek to cause chaos and destruction. A recent intelligence report has shed light on the deep rooted nature of these threats, highlighting the extent of their connections to criminal networks and foreign entities. The report suggests that a rising number of groups have been active across India, carrying out attacks on civilians and security forces alike. Many of these groups are funded by outside sources, and engage in illegal activities such as smuggling and narcotics distribution to finance their operations. While the Indian government has taken measures to crack down on these threats, there remains a long road ahead to ensure the safety and security of the nation's citizens. With ongoing efforts to expose hidden information, however, there is hope that India can thwart these dangers and move towards a safer, more peaceful future.", "In the wake of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, researchers in Canada have raised concerns about the increasing prevalence of another global health crisis obesity. In a highly informative investigation, scientists have discovered that the lockdowns, working from home, and sedentary lifestyles have led to a surge in unhealthy food consumption and a lack of physical activity among Canadians. As a result, cases of obesity and related illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are on the rise, putting immense pressure on an already overburdened healthcare system. Furthermore, the investigation has revealed that the availability of healthy food choices is scarce, even in Canada's urban centers. The government now faces a pressing need to prioritize public health and introduce urgent measures to tackle this hidden epidemic.", "Investigative journalism reveals shocking news regarding the global health crisis and pandemic in Egypt. According to an anonymous whistleblower, several doctors and nurses in local hospitals have been hiding patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and delaying their test results. Further investigation uncovers that the reason behind their fraudulent activities is due to a lack of essential protective equipment including face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer and insufficient testing kits. Many health care professionals, who have also been infected due to inadequate safety precautions, fear being ostracized and shamed due to the stigma surrounding the disease. This malpractice has led to a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths in Egypt, with reports estimating that the actual number of cases could be much higher than speculated. The Egyptian health ministry must act swiftly and decisively in enforcing emergency measures to ensure the safety of medical staff and the general public.", "News Analysis Japan's Geopolitical Tensions Escalate Due to Territorial Disputes Japan, a wealthy island country in East Asia, is facing rising geopolitical tensions due to territorial disputes with its neighboring countries. The latest dispute is with South Korea, which has been reignited following the South Korean court's decision allowing its citizens to sue Japanese firms for forced labor during World War II. The Japanese government has condemned the decision and called for a diplomatic solution, but their request was not heeded. Japan has since retaliated by imposing trade restrictions on South Korea, further exacerbating the fragile relationship between the two nations. However, Japan is not the only country with territorial disputes on its agenda. China has also been involved in a number of territorial disputes with Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia. The conflict over the South China Sea has been particularly contentious, with China's territorial claims challenging the sovereignty of smaller countries in the region. The escalation of geopolitical tensions has far reaching consequences, affecting not only Japan and its neighbors but also the global economy. As these territorial disputes remain unresolved, they pose a constant threat to stability in the region and beyond.", "News analysis Japan braces for possible natural disaster Following the recent earthquake in northern Japan, there are fears that the country could be hit by another natural disaster. Officials have warned that the current situation could trigger landslides and mudflows, particularly in areas that have recently been struck by earthquakes. The government is closely monitoring the situation and has urged residents to exercise caution. The possibility of further natural disasters has highlighted the need for better disaster preparedness in Japan. The country is situated in an area known as the \"Ring of Fire,\" where volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are common. Despite this, many properties in Japan are still not earthquake proof, putting residents at risk in the event of a large earthquake. The government has pledged to take action to improve disaster preparedness in Japan, including building more earthquake resistant buildings and better educating the public on how to respond to natural disasters. Despite these efforts, it remains to be seen whether Japan will be able to prevent another major disaster in the future.", "News Analysis COVID 19 Surge Threatens Italian Economy Italy, which endured a devastating early round of COVID 19 infections, is now facing another surge. The Italian healthcare system, which is still struggling to recover from the first wave of the pandemic, is being stretched thin once again. However, this outbreak could potentially have wider ramifications, as it threatens the already vulnerable Italian economy. The Government has placed new restrictions on cities experiencing spikes, but the problem is quickly becoming widespread across the country. The new restrictions could have several knock on effects, such as further depressing the already struggling tourism and hospitality sectors. Moreover, with Italy already facing economic headwinds, any further downturn could ultimately threaten the stability of the Eurozone. The virus has disrupted life in Italy numerous times, and each time, the country has had to adapt again. This new threat is no exception as it continues to punch downward on Italy's economy. The government and the general public, however, are still holding out hope that increased restrictions will ultimately translate into a decline in COVID 19 numbers.", "News analysis The resurgence of violence in Papua New Guinea is a cause for concern. The government is struggling to contain the spread of arms in the country's urban centers. Recent incidents, including a deadly shooting at a police station in Port Moresby, have highlighted the challenge. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted. Corruption and political instability have weakened the rule of law, allowing criminal gangs and tribal clashes to spiral out of control. Poverty and inequality are driving young men to turn to gangs to make a living. The government needs to address these underlying issues to regain control of the situation. Until then, the people of Papua New Guinea will continue to suffer.", "As a devastating typhoon hit the eastern coast of China, thousands of residents were forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in makeshift evacuation centers. The typhoon made landfall on Sunday, leaving a trail of destruction in its path and triggering a massive humanitarian crisis. Relief efforts are now underway, with emergency teams working around the clock to provide aid and support to those affected by the disaster. As part of the relief effort, volunteers from across China have mobilized to provide assistance to those in need. Many are focusing on delivering water, food, and medical supplies, while others are working to clear debris and restore access to essential services. Despite the challenging conditions, the resilience and spirit of the Chinese people are shining through. Local communities are banding together to support one another, with many donating their time and resources to help those affected by the disaster. As the recovery effort continues, it is clear that the strength and determination of the Chinese people will play a significant role in the country's ability to bounce back from this devastating disaster.", "China is currently facing severe geopolitical tensions and territorial disputes with neighboring countries over the South China Sea. The issue has escalated over the years with multiple countries claiming their rights over the resource rich waters. China has been accused of building artificial islands and militarizing the region, raising concerns over the freedom of navigation and security. The conflict has gained international attention with the involvement of the US, which conducts frequent naval patrols in the disputed waters. The situation has sparked fear in the region and has led to increased military presence, heightening tensions between China and its neighboring countries. The resolution of this dispute remains a topic of great concern, and any untoward incident can significantly impact the geopolitical dynamics of the region.", "(FEATURE WRITING) France's push towards renewable energy A story of innovation and resilience France has been steadily increasing its commitment to renewable energy in recent years. With initiatives such as the 'Energy Transition Act' and the 'One Hundred Thousand Roofs Plan', the country is determined to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and decrease its carbon footprint. However, this journey towards more sustainable energy sources has not been without its challenges. France's nuclear reactors have traditionally been the backbone of its energy system, with the country currently relying on nuclear power for over 70 of its electricity. This presents a logistical and political challenge when it comes to transitioning to renewables. Despite these obstacles, France has forged ahead with wind and solar power projects, with the goal of meeting 33 of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. From the innovative solar panel covered roadways to urban wind turbines, there are numerous examples of how France is creatively tackling its energy transition. One inspiring example is that of the town of Mouans Sartoux in southeastern France. The town has implemented an ambitious energy transition plan, which includes building solar farms and increasing green spaces, all while involving the local community in the process. The goal is for the town to be powered solely by renewable energy sources within the next few years. France's move towards renewables is not just a matter of environmental responsibility. It's also an economic opportunity. The shift has already created new jobs and business opportunities for companies specializing in clean energy technology. As France leads the way towards a cleaner energy future, it serves as an example for countries around the world to follow. In the face of challenges, France has shown resilience and innovation in approaching the issue of renewable energy, proving that the transition to a more sustainable energy system is not only possible, but desirable.", "In Algeria, access to electricity remains a major issue, particularly in rural areas. For millions of people in the country, going without electricity is a daily reality. However, a group of engineers and scientists from Algeria and France have come together to devise a solution to this ongoing struggle. They have designed a solar powered generator that aims to bring electricity to rural communities in Algeria. The generator is able to withstand harsh environmental conditions and requires minimal maintenance, making it ideal for use in places where electricity infrastructure is scarce. The project is currently in the testing phase but is expected to roll out soon, providing power to thousands of Algerians who have been living without electricity for years.", "Feature Writing In South Africa, thousands of refugees have been left stranded and helpless due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Hailing from countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia, they have fled persecution and war in search of safety only to be met with disappointment. Many of them have been living on the streets of Cape Town for months, struggling to find shelter and food. Despite the dire situation, several non profit organizations have taken up the cause of providing relief to these displaced individuals. The Gift of the Givers, a South African based humanitarian aid group, has been working tirelessly to cater to the needs of refugees. They have been delivering food, water, and medical supplies to the refugee camps and community centers. One such camp is in Bellville, a particularly struggling area in Cape Town. Here, the Gift of the Givers have stepped in to provide multifaceted support to the refugees. They have distributed blankets, food parcels, and donated clothes to those in need.

Recent studies indicate that the country is on the verge of experiencing more frequent and intense natural disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and floods. With the government failing to take decisive action on combatting these challenges, Mexico s citizenry must push for policies that prioritize environmentally sustainable practices and technologies. Failure to act will cost us dearly in the future, both in terms of human and financial losses. It is time for Mexico to lead by example in the region by embracing green energy infrastructure, enforcing strict conservation laws, investing in eco tourism, and providing incentives for individuals and businesses to reduce their carbon footprints. The window of opportunity to address the issue of climate change is fast closing, and Mexico must act urgently if we are to avoid leaving a bleak future for the generations to come.", "As the world continues to face unprecedented challenges, the importance of international collaborations and partnerships has become more evident than ever.

The country has largely avoided being directly targeted by violent extremists in recent years, but there is an increasing sense of unease that this may change. The recent killing of a prominent politician by a far right group highlights the threat that these groups can pose to Japan's security. The government must take proactive measures to protect the country from security threats both domestic and foreign.

Given the potential magnitude of the threat, it is imperative that all stakeholders work together to ensure the safety and security of the country and its citizens.", "Op Ed Japan grapples with human rights and social justice movements As the world continues to confront social justice issues, Japan finds itself caught in the crossfire. While many applaud Japan's progress in some areas of human rights, others question the country's commitment to true social justice. One hotly debated issue is LGBT rights. Japan has made recent strides, with Tokyo passing new anti discrimination laws protecting LGBT individuals. However, critics argue that there are still no legal protections for same sex marriage or gender identity, leaving many vulnerable to discrimination. Another issue is the exploitation of foreign workers. Japan has a significant population of migrant workers, many of whom work in low wage jobs without adequate protections. Some migrant workers report abusive working conditions and unsafe living situations, leading to calls for stronger protections. Despite these challenges, there are promising signs of progress. Civil society groups have been vocal in advocating for social justice and human rights, and the government has shown a willingness to engage with these issues.

However, with the emergence of the Delta variant, the country is facing its biggest health crisis yet. Experts warn that the variant could quickly overwhelm the country's limited health resources and endanger the lives of its citizens. The Samoan government has recently implemented a nationwide lockdown in an effort to contain the outbreak. However, many experts argue that the country needs urgent support from the international community to bolster its healthcare system and prevent the spread of the Delta variant.

In particular, drug cartels have controlled much of Mexico's illegal drug trade, fueling violence and instability. Despite efforts to ramp up law enforcement efforts, the prevalence of corruption continues to undermine these efforts, with many officials commonly bribed or coerced by criminal groups. This has led to a widespread sense of impunity for criminal elements, who often operate without fear of punishment. Furthermore, cross border criminal activities such as human trafficking and money laundering remain pervasive in Mexico, with many businesses and individuals involved in these illegal activities. As a result, the country has continued to face significant economic challenges and struggles, with long lasting impacts on its political and social systems.

Over the years, the country has adopted various policies to curb the inflow of migrants and refugees, including the deployment of troops to its southern border and offering asylum to select individuals. However, the COVID pandemic has further exacerbated the situation, with the country experiencing a surge in illegal immigration as a consequence of the U.S immigration policies. Thousands of people, including unaccompanied minors, have been making their way to the U.S border with Mexico, only to be turned back by the border patrol. The Mexican government's measure to combat the problem is the deployment of its national guard along the southern border to help crack down on illegal crossings. However, the measures have faced significant scrutiny with questions arising on the ethical implications of subduing individuals that may have fled to the county due to oppressive regimes in their respective countries. In conclusion, while the Mexican government is making efforts to curb migration and refugee crises, the solutions must be more realistic, considering the root causes of why individuals immigrate in the first place. Otherwise, these crises will continue to pose significant threats to the already fragile and unstable reason.", "News Analysis International collaborations and partnerships pave the way towards a better future in the Netherlands The Netherlands is a country that has always paved the way forward by forming international collaborations and partnerships.

Despite the massive influx of assistance to the country, poverty rates remain high, with 20 of the population living below the poverty line. The causes of this unsettling trend stem from the mismanagement and misuse of aid funds that have not been adequately allocated to the country's most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, some aid has been diverted illegitimately for personal gain. Scandalous cases of embezzlement involving individuals from aid organizations and government officials have been uncovered in recent years. This unethical behavior has led to distrust, disillusionment, and a lack of faith from the affected communities.

Since 2010, the country has experienced devastating floods and droughts, which have led to crop failures and displacement of thousands of people. The Nigerian government has been slow to implement environmental policies that would address climate change issues. However, there are indications that things are about to change. Recently, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, announced that the country would increase its commitment to address climate change by adopting more stringent environmental policies. This will come as a relief to many Nigerian communities that have been affected by climate change. However, questions still linger on the extent to which these policies will be enforced, particularly in the face of powerful interest groups that may oppose them. Furthermore, there is a need for Nigeria to collaborate with other countries in the world to tackle climate change. This means that the Nigerian government needs to take its commitment to climate change seriously and prioritize it in its foreign policy. More importantly, the private sector and civil society must also be mobilized to play a crucial role in shaping the environmental policies of the country. As Nigeria looks to harvest the opportunities of its oil and gas resources, it needs to ensure that the environment is not further degraded. The Nigerian government has an opportunity, beyond making bold pronouncements, to show that it is committed to climate change by implementing environmental policies that will improve the lives of its people.", "In Pakistan, increasing concerns about climate change have led to the implementation of new environmental policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability.

To gain insight into these issues, we spoke with Detective Nakamura, who works with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. According to Nakamura, cross border crime in Japan often involves organized crime groups, such as the yakuza, and can range from human trafficking to drug smuggling to financial crimes. Meanwhile, corruption cases often involve public officials accepting bribes or kickbacks. It is a complex web of transnational activity that requires collaboration with authorities from other countries. Nakamura noted that one of the biggest difficulties in investigating cross border crime is the lack of cooperation from other countries. He explained that some countries may not have the same level of law enforcement capabilities as Japan, or they may be hesitant to share information. Additionally, cultural and linguistic differences can also pose challenges. Despite these obstacles, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department continues to work tirelessly to combat cross border crime and corruption to keep citizens safe and maintain trust in the justice system.", "In Japan, the COVID 19 pandemic has ravaged the nation, prompting government leaders to implement strict preventive measures.

In particular, drug cartels have controlled much of Mexico's illegal drug trade, fueling violence and instability. Despite efforts to ramp up law enforcement efforts, the prevalence of corruption continues to undermine these efforts, with many officials commonly bribed or coerced by criminal groups. This has led to a widespread sense of impunity for criminal elements, who often operate without fear of punishment. Furthermore, cross border criminal activities such as human trafficking and money laundering remain pervasive in Mexico, with many businesses and individuals involved in these illegal activities. As a result, the country has continued to face significant economic challenges and struggles, with long lasting impacts on its political and social systems. The inability to effectively tackle these issues has compounded Mexico's struggles, and will continue to pose significant challenges without a more concerted effort to confront these issues head on.", "News Analysis Migration and Refugee Crises in Mexico Mexico has been a hotbed of migration and refugee crises, owing to its geographical location as a transit route for Central and South Americans heading to the United States. Over the years, the country has adopted various policies to curb the inflow of migrants and refugees, including the deployment of troops to its southern border and offering asylum to select individuals. However, the COVID pandemic has further exacerbated the situation, with the country experiencing a surge in illegal immigration as a consequence of the U.S immigration policies. Thousands of people, including unaccompanied minors, have been making their way to the U.S border with Mexico, only to be turned back by the border patrol. The Mexican government's measure to combat the problem is the deployment of its national guard along the southern border to help crack down on illegal crossings. However, the measures have faced significant scrutiny with questions arising on the ethical implications of subduing individuals that may have fled to the county due to oppressive regimes in their respective countries. In conclusion, while the Mexican government is making efforts to curb migration and refugee crises, the solutions must be more realistic, considering the root causes of why individuals immigrate in the first place. Otherwise, these crises will continue to pose significant threats to the already fragile and unstable reason.", "News Analysis International Aid in Mexico Mexico is a country that has faced many challenges over the years, notably in the areas of poverty and inequality.

The COVID 19 pandemic has already exposed the vulnerability of Colombia's public healthcare sector, which has long suffered from underfunding and inadequate resources. Furthermore, the lack of access to healthcare in rural and lower income communities has only worsened the scenario, increasing the risk of outbreaks. This problem highlights a broader issue in South America, where unequal access to healthcare in underdeveloped regions continues to be a concern for policymakers. Additionally, climate change and deforestation are increasing the chances of zoonotic diseases affecting humans, exacerbating the health risks. The Colombian government has taken various measures to improve healthcare, but they appear to be insufficient in tackling the issues at hand.

However, the rapid increase in refugees is putting a strain on Colombia's already fragile infrastructure and resources. According to the United Nations, over 1.7 million Venezuelans have fled their country in recent years, with many settling in Colombia. The influx of refugees has put pressure on Colombia's health care, education, and housing services. This has led to rising tensions between locals and migrants, as many Colombians believe the government is not doing enough to address the issues. Furthermore, the COVID 19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, making it harder for refugees to get jobs or access basic necessities. The government has implemented measures to try to control the spread of the disease, such as closing borders, but these policies have left many migrants stranded without access to essential services or support. As the migration and refugee crises continue to worsen, it is clear that Colombia will need more assistance from the international community to successfully manage this ongoing humanitarian crisis.", "News Analysis Cross Border Crime and Corruption in South Africa Cross border crime and corruption have long been a serious challenge for law enforcement agencies in South Africa. These criminals exploit the porous borders and weak governance structures of neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Lesotho to smuggle drugs, weapons, and other contraband. They also use these countries as safe havens to launder illicit funds and evade arrest. Challenges in curbing cross border crime and corruption in South Africa include limited resources, corruption within law enforcement agencies, and inadequate international cooperation. Despite these challenges, South Africa has taken some steps to address these issues. For instance, they have worked with neighbouring countries to establish joint law enforcement bodies and have strengthened their anti corruption laws.

The Nigerian government has been slow to implement environmental policies that would address climate change issues. However, there are indications that things are about to change. Recently, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, announced that the country would increase its commitment to address climate change by adopting more stringent environmental policies. This will come as a relief to many Nigerian communities that have been affected by climate change. However, questions still linger on the extent to which these policies will be enforced, particularly in the face of powerful interest groups that may oppose them. Furthermore, there is a need for Nigeria to collaborate with other countries in the world to tackle climate change. This means that the Nigerian government needs to take its commitment to climate change seriously and prioritize it in its foreign policy. More importantly, the private sector and civil society must also be mobilized to play a crucial role in shaping the environmental policies of the country. As Nigeria looks to harvest the opportunities of its oil and gas resources, it needs to ensure that the environment is not further degraded.

The COVID 19 pandemic has already exposed the vulnerability of Colombia's public healthcare sector, which has long suffered from underfunding and inadequate resources. Furthermore, the lack of access to healthcare in rural and lower income communities has only worsened the scenario, increasing the risk of outbreaks. This problem highlights a broader issue in South America, where unequal access to healthcare in underdeveloped regions continues to be a concern for policymakers. Additionally, climate change and deforestation are increasing the chances of zoonotic diseases affecting humans, exacerbating the health risks. The Colombian government has taken various measures to improve healthcare, but they appear to be insufficient in tackling the issues at hand. International aid, policies, and cooperation in addressing these crises are now crucial to prevent future pandemics. If ignored, such loopholes and gaps could result in a dire need for significant structural and systemic changes in the healthcare sector, not just in Colombia but worldwide.", "News Analysis Colombia Struggles to Handle Migration and Refugee Crises As the number of migrants and refugees continues to rise, Colombia is struggling to handle the influx. The country has become a major hub for people fleeing violence and persecution in neighboring countries, particularly Venezuela. However, the rapid increase in refugees is putting a strain on Colombia's already fragile infrastructure and resources. According to the United Nations, over 1.7 million Venezuelans have fled their country in recent years, with many settling in Colombia. The influx of refugees has put pressure on Colombia's health care, education, and housing services. This has led to rising tensions between locals and migrants, as many Colombians believe the government is not doing enough to address the issues. Furthermore, the COVID 19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, making it harder for refugees to get jobs or access basic necessities. The government has implemented measures to try to control the spread of the disease, such as closing borders, but these policies have left many migrants stranded without access to essential services or support. As the migration and refugee crises continue to worsen, it is clear that Colombia will need more assistance from the international community to successfully manage this ongoing humanitarian crisis.", "South Africa grapples with impact of escalating global tensions South Africa, like many other countries, is increasingly caught in the crosshairs of the escalating tensions between the world's superpowers.

Despite the government's efforts to provide support and facilitate their integration, many refugees continue to struggle with language and cultural barriers, as well as discrimination from the South Korean population. The recent decision to grant citizenship to a group of 31 refugees has sparked criticism from those who believe that granting citizenship too easily will only encourage more North Koreans to escape. South Korea's refugee policies are also being impacted by the global migration crisis, which has seen an increase in the number of refugees attempting to make their way to South Korea from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan. As tensions continue to rise and the number of refugees in South Korea grows, the government faces mounting pressure to find solutions that balance humanitarian concerns with national security interests.", "In Guatemala, international aid and development efforts are being implemented to address the country's growing poverty rate and food insecurity. The World Food Programme (WFP) has recently announced a 46 million aid plan in the region, which will help provide relief aid and stable food sources to over 875,000 people. However, despite the good intentions of aid organizations, local officials have raised concerns about the effectiveness of foreign aid and external investments to improve the country's socio economic landscape. Experts suggest the need for collaboration between the international community, local organizations and private sector to build sustainable development efforts. Nevertheless, some in the government have criticized foreign aid efforts as a band aid solution, calling for a larger scale shift in national policies and economic models. As Guatemala confronts critical developmental challenges, finding the right mix of aid, investment and policy shifts to steer the country towards progress and recovery remains a delicate balancing act.", "News analysis In a bid to contribute towards international aid and development efforts, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a 10 million donation to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

From devastating wildfires to severe floods, climate change is rapidly increasing the risk of these events in the country. Experts warn that without urgent action, Canadians will continue to face increasing risks and challenges. According to a recent report, the country's western provinces are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as wildfires and droughts, because of their arid landscapes and lack of moisture. This is causing immense damage to ecosystems, economy, and Canadians' wellbeing. Furthermore, Canada's changing climate is also leading to more devastating floods in eastern provinces, and coastal vulnerabilities to rising sea levels and storm surges.

With terrorist organizations frequently using social media to recruit members and communicate their plans, the South Korean government is using the same platform to identify and monitor potential terrorist activity. According to government officials, this approach has already led to the arrest of several suspects in recent months. In an exclusive interview with the head of the National Intelligence Service in Seoul, the agency revealed that their monitoring of social media spiked during the recent Olympics in Pyeongchang. The government coordinated with major social media providers to flag potential threats, resulting in the arrest of several individuals.

With billions of dollars being funneled into various development projects across Africa, Asia, and South America, many are now questioning the true motives behind China's aid efforts. While Beijing has repeatedly touted its aid and development initiatives as being solely aimed at helping poorer nations achieve economic growth and development, there are concerns that China is using its aid as a tool to advance its geopolitical agenda. Critics argue that China is using its aid to win favor with certain countries and to gain access to valuable natural resources. Moreover, some experts warn that China's aid and development efforts may not be as effective as they could be. With many of the projects being undertaken by Chinese firms, there are fears that they may not be focused on the needs of local communities or may not be sustainable in the long run. Despite these challenges, many in China remain committed to expanding their aid and development efforts. As the country becomes increasingly influential on the global stage, it will be vital for policymakers to closely monitor China's aid policies and ensure that they are being used for the betterment of all nations.", "In recent years, the international aid and development efforts in Venezuela have been the subject of heated debate. While some argue that the current political and economic climate renders aid efforts futile, others argue that the country's population is in dire need of assistance. Despite these disagreements, one thing remains clear the people of Venezuela are facing significant hardship. The country's economic crisis has left millions struggling to secure basic necessities such as food and medicine, while political instability has led to violence and unrest. As a result, it is important for the international community to continue to provide aid and support to the people of Venezuela. This can include efforts to address immediate needs, such as providing medicine and food, as well as longer term efforts aimed at rebuilding the country's economy and political institutions. Ultimately, while aid efforts may face significant challenges in Venezuela, they remain a critical component of the ongoing struggle to improve the lives of its citizens.

The report brings to light the issue of overcrowding, coupled with severe violations of the migrants rights, poor hygiene, and malnutrition. Migrants are often held in overcrowded and poorly equipped facilities, likened to squalid prison cells where they are deprived of their basic needs. The majority of them are left to endure the harsh conditions without access to basic medical care, enough food or water, or any form of protection. Moreover, reports indicate the existence of organized networks seemingly behind the human trafficking incidents that escort refugees through the country to their final destinations in Libya and Europe. Algeria, which shares its borders with Libya, remains one of the main route options for refugees and asylum seekers.

The influx of international fashion brands coupled with the advent of social media has brought about a new era of individualistic fashion expression. However, this trend has been met with opposition from traditionalists who see it as a dilution of Ethiopian culture. Some have also noted that this new trend is primarily located in urban areas and among the wealthy elite, raising questions about the accessibility of these new fashion expressions to the wider population. Amidst this cultural shift, Ethiopia has also experienced social changes, largely driven by the youth. Questions about gender identity and sexual orientation have been at the forefront of these changes, with many young Ethiopians actively pushing for more inclusive policies and expanded rights. This movement has, however, received backlash from religious leaders and traditionalists, leading to heated discussions within the country's social and political spheres.

Despite these challenges, humanitarian organizations are stepping up to help South Africans in need. They have launched ambitious plans to address the urgent needs of feeding those struggling with hunger, providing access to clean water and sanitation, and offering temporary shelter. In addition to supporting relief efforts, we must advocate for a change in the systemic factors that contribute to poverty, climate vulnerability, and an increasing income gap.

It is a complex and multifaceted issue that demands attention, action, and compassion from policymakers, NGOs, and the public alike. While some South Africans have welcomed refugees with open arms, others have expressed concern about the potential social and economic impact of their presence. There have been reports of xenophobic attacks and tensions between different communities, highlighting the need for greater empathy and understanding. One positive development, however, has been the emergence of innovative solutions to support refugees, such as the use of renewable energy to power refugee camps and the use of blockchain technology to improve access to healthcare. These initiatives hold the promise of a brighter future for displaced people in South Africa and beyond. It is our collective responsibility to create a more welcoming, inclusive, and sustainable world for all.", "Mexico is a country that is always making headlines, both for its vibrant culture and its ongoing struggles with crime and corruption. But amid all the chaos, it's worth remembering that there are many positive stories coming out of Mexico as well. For example, this week saw the opening of a new educational center in Guadalajara, focused on providing training for people with disabilities. This is great news for a country where disability is still often seen as a shameful thing, and where many people with disabilities struggle to access education and employment. With this new center, Mexico is taking a big step forward in providing equal opportunities for all its citizens, and should be commended for its efforts.", "Op Eds As Brazil goes to the polls, international observers are watching with bated breath.

In a recent development, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid challenged India to hand over wanted criminals who are hiding in their country. \"We will not spare any fugitive, whether they are in Pakistan or outside the country,\" he declared. This move comes after the Pakistan Army claimed to have destroyed a major drug smuggling ring in the northwestern region of Pakistan. In an exclusive interview, a member of the drug cartel who was finally caught and turned state witness revealed the extent to which corruption was rampant in the system. \"We had informers within the police, army, and even politicians,\" he lamented.

We weren't told to evacuate, and my family and I barely made it out alive,\" Ahmed shared. The flooding was caused by heavy monsoon rains and affected thousands of households along the Indus River Basin. Moreover, the government was criticized for their slow response time in order to assist those affected by the floods. Emergencies and disasters have become a common occurrence in Pakistan, with climate change being an additional factor aggravating the situation. The government must take proactive measures such as developing early warning and evacuation systems, as well as implementing more sustainable policies to prevent prolonged environmental damage. Until then, those affected by these tragedies will continue to suffer the worst consequences of negligence.", "In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011, humanitarian crises and relief efforts were in the spotlight.

While applauding the move towards more sustainable practices, critics argue it may not go far enough in reducing Algeria's carbon footprint. Despite being a relatively small contributor to global emissions, Algeria is feeling the effects of climate change through heightened temperatures and an increase in desertification. The government's actions to promote renewable energy such as solar and wind power are commendable, but ultimately they must prioritize concerted efforts to reduce overall carbon emissions if they hope to mitigate the effects of climate change on their nation and the world. As an influential player in the region, Algeria has the power to demonstrate how environmental policies can benefit both ecological and economic factors, leading the way for other nations to follow suit.", "As coronavirus continues to disrupt lives in Algeria, the world watches cautiously to monitor its impact on the region. With a strained health system and limited medical supplies, experts warn the country could face a health crisis if infections continue to surge. The government has taken steps to stem the tide of infections, implementing mandatory curfews and strict mask mandates. However, many Algeria citizens are flouting these regulations, with few repercussions for their actions. As opinions remain divided on the best way to combat the virus, it is essential for Algeria's citizens and leaders to band together and prioritize public health above their political or personal interests. Otherwise, the country may face dire consequences and further destabilization in the future.", "Op Eds The issue of territorial disputes in the South China Sea continues to create tensions in the region. The recent deployment of military assets by the United States in the area has been met with condemnation by the Chinese government. They view such actions as an attempt to limit their influence and control in the disputed waters. China has continued to assert its claims of sovereignty over the waters, which have led to tensions with other countries such as Japan and Vietnam. These disputes have been exacerbated by China's rapid military buildup and aggressive territorial claims. It is imperative that all countries involved in the disputes engage in dialogue and work towards a peaceful resolution to avoid escalating tensions. The international community must encourage multilateral negotiations to ensure a fair and equitable outcome for all parties involved. Given China's growing economic and military influence in the region, it is important for all stakeholders to engage constructively to avoid a large scale conflict that could destabilize the region and affect the world at large.", "Geopolitical tensions and territorial disputes remain a top concern for the United States as conflicts continue to flare up across the globe.

Environmental experts and stakeholders have long been advocating for Australia to take firmer action to curb its carbon emissions, as the nation remains one of the biggest contributors to global warming. Given this pressing challenge, the recent announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison that a fund worth 2 billion will be allocated to reducing emissions is a welcome move. The fund is set to support regional and remote communities in implementing renewable energy projects and developing local industries focussed on sustainability. While it s too soon to say whether this will be sufficient to address Australia s environmental challenges, it s certainly a step in the right direction. The government s move has also received praise from a range of environmental groups, although concerns remain. Tim Flannery, one of Australia's leading scientists and an influential voice on climate change, commented that the country's leaders must explore all options, including carbon capture and storage, to truly make an impact on the environment.

They also accuse the military of controlling every aspect of the country covertly, using violence and forced disappearance of political opponents to maintain power. As a result, the government has declared a state of emergency and deployed security forces in the streets to keep order.

Adding to the chorus of outcry, social justice movements have begun to gain momentum across the country. One such movement is the push for greater representation and recognition of the country's Indigenous communities. A recent event highlighted Australia's unacknowledged history of genocide and enslavement of Indigenous people, leading to a widespread call for constitutional recognition and reparations.

The cave contains significant cultural material and provides insights into the ancient rock art of Australia. Experts argue that without intervention, such rich expressions of historical and cultural heritage may be lost forever.

The report also exposes how aid organizations and their projects have been used for personal gain by officials, with inflated budgets, forged contracts, and cut corners in materials and construction. The result is a lack of progress in development goals and perpetuation of poverty. Officials, when confronted, have denied any wrongdoing, but the report has sparked public outrage and calls for accountability. It remains to be seen if the Chinese government will take action to address the issue and ensure international aid is used properly to benefit those in need.", "After months of escalating tensions between the two countries, China has officially declared war on Taiwan. Sources inside the Chinese government have revealed that this decision was made after months of secret negotiations between the People's Republic of China and North Korea. China's move has intensified global conflicts and raised concerns about the potential for a wider war in the region. The United States, Taiwan's closest ally, has condemned China's actions and vowed to provide Taiwan with any assistance necessary. There are reports of heavy fighting along the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan has already experienced significant damage from China's aerial bombardment. This conflict is expected to have significant economic and humanitarian consequences, creating a wave of refugees from Taiwan. This investigative journalism report reveals that China's triggering of war goes beyond claiming sovereignty over Taiwan and shows the country's aggressive and expansionist policies in the Pacific region as well as the world at large. The impact of this conflict is likely to be felt for years to come and could destabilize the entire region if not contained.", "In recent years, China has been experiencing a significant cultural shift. While traditional customs and values remain important to many Chinese citizens, the younger generation is beginning to embrace Western ideals and practices. One example of this cultural shift can be seen in the rise of social media in China. Platforms like WeChat and Weibo have become incredibly popular, providing a new space for Chinese citizens to express themselves and connect with others. At the same time, however, the Chinese government has been tightening its grip on the internet, with measures such as the Great Firewall limiting access to certain websites and content. This has created a tension between the desire for cultural openness and the need for political control. Despite these challenges, China is poised to continue its cultural and social evolution. As the country becomes more connected with the rest of the world, new ideas and influences will continue to impact Chinese culture, creating a dynamic and evolving society.", "The COVID 19 pandemic which originated in Wuhan city of China has now spread throughout the world, resulting in over one million deaths worldwide. The impact of this global health crisis has been severe, affecting not just the health of people, but also their livelihoods. In China itself, the government has implemented strict measures to control the spread of the virus, including lockdowns and travel restrictions. Despite the efforts, COVID 19 continues to have lasting effects on China's economy. As we look to the future, it is clear that pandemics such as this one will continue to pose a threat to global health and economies. It is essential to invest in health system infrastructure, infectious disease surveillance, and promote research specific to pandemics. Lessons learned from COVID 19 should be incorporated into future health and economic pandemic plans to allow for swift and effective responses. In conclusion, the COVID 19 pandemic may have initially started in China, but its effects are being felt around the world. As a global community, we must work together to ensure that we are better prepared to handle future health crises and pandemics. This can only be achieved by investing in our health systems and by promoting scientific research to find effective treatments and vaccines.", "As a nation that has seen its share of conflict and turmoil over the years, South Africa has had to grapple with the ongoing challenge of migration and refugee crises.

This unethical behavior has led to distrust, disillusionment, and a lack of faith from the affected communities. Experts assert that there is an urgent need for transparency and accountability in the allocation and distribution of international aid in Samoa.

Amidst the country's rapid urbanization and development, historical sites and artifacts have often been neglected or destroyed in the name of progress. However, the Chinese government has implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the preservation of its rich cultural heritage. One such initiative is the restoration of the ancient city of Pingyao in central China's Shanxi province. The city, which was once a bustling commercial hub during the Ming and Qing dynasties, had fallen into disrepair over the years. But with the help of government funding and private investment, the city has been revitalized, with many of its buildings restored to their former glory. Another example is the promotion of traditional Chinese culture through the popularization of ancient art forms such as calligraphy, paper cutting, and Chinese opera.

The refugees, who fled Libya after enduring years of civil war and instability, are encountering new challenges amid a lack of infrastructure and limited resources in Algeria. The situation has prompted emergency relief efforts to aid the refugees, who are living in overpopulated camps without adequate access to food, water, and medical care. Though international aid organizations have rallied around the crisis, the situation in Algeria remains dire. Local officials acknowledge that they are overwhelmed by the number of refugees seeking assistance, and fear that aid organizations may be unable to keep pace with demand.

In a recent investigation, it was revealed that several opposition leaders have been targeted by a state sponsored terror campaign, with many of them being subjected to physical assault or surveillance. The investigation also exposed links between the government and various criminal organizations that are known to engage in extortion and drug trafficking.

Lima is known as a popular destination for tourists, but where natives struggle to meet their basic needs. This disparity is particularly striking in historically significant locations, such as the Plaza de Armas, where street vendors are prevalent and few tourists venture outside the walls of luxurious hotels. The organizers of \"Peru's Invisible Walls\" aim to break down these barriers, encouraging visitors to integrate better with local culture. Collaborating with local businesses, they provide tourists with authentic cultural experiences, such as participation in local festivals or community projects, to reduce the cultural divide. Efforts are also being made to encourage cultural exchange through social media. The campaign is already gaining momentum, providing hope of a more unified future, with the gradual breaking down of cultural barriers in Peru and beyond.", "In the wake of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, researchers in Canada have raised concerns about the increasing prevalence of another global health crisis obesity. In a highly informative investigation, scientists have discovered that the lockdowns, working from home, and sedentary lifestyles have led to a surge in unhealthy food consumption and a lack of physical activity among Canadians. As a result, cases of obesity and related illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are on the rise, putting immense pressure on an already overburdened healthcare system. Furthermore, the investigation has revealed that the availability of healthy food choices is scarce, even in Canada's urban centers. The government now faces a pressing need to prioritize public health and introduce urgent measures to tackle this hidden epidemic.", "Investigative journalism reveals shocking news regarding the global health crisis and pandemic in Egypt. According to an anonymous whistleblower, several doctors and nurses in local hospitals have been hiding patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and delaying their test results. Further investigation uncovers that the reason behind their fraudulent activities is due to a lack of essential protective equipment including face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer and insufficient testing kits. Many health care professionals, who have also been infected due to inadequate safety precautions, fear being ostracized and shamed due to the stigma surrounding the disease. This malpractice has led to a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths in Egypt, with reports estimating that the actual number of cases could be much higher than speculated. The Egyptian health ministry must act swiftly and decisively in enforcing emergency measures to ensure the safety of medical staff and the general public.", "In the world of international politics and diplomacy, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a solution that satisfies everyone. This is especially true in India, where tensions with Pakistan have reached new heights. The two countries have been at odds over the disputed region of Kashmir for decades, but recently tensions have escalated to the point of military confrontation. Despite diplomatic efforts, there has been little progress in resolving the conflict. The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has taken a firm stance on the issue, insisting that it will not back down until Pakistan withdraws its troops and ends its support of Kashmiri separatists. Meanwhile, Pakistan has accused India of human rights abuses in Kashmir and has called for international intervention. The situation has become so tense that many fear a full blown war could break out at any moment. As the world watches and waits to see what will happen, it is clear that the conflict in Kashmir is not just a local issue, but a global concern. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this long standing dispute could have serious implications for the entire region.", "India Gears Up to Tackle Global Health Crisis Amidst the COVID 19 pandemic, India is steadily gearing up to address various health crises witnessed across the globe.

Many are fleeing from war torn countries like Syria, but others are simply looking for a better life in Europe. The French government is facing pressure from both sides of the political spectrum, with some calling for an open door policy and others demanding stricter immigration controls. One family caught in the midst of this crisis is the Mahdi family, who arrived in France two years ago after fleeing from Aleppo, Syria. They are still struggling to adjust to life in their new home, even as they work to build a new life for themselves. Meanwhile, local authorities are struggling to keep up with the demand for housing, shelter, and medical care for refugees who are flooding the cities.

In particular, drug cartels have controlled much of Mexico's illegal drug trade, fueling violence and instability. Despite efforts to ramp up law enforcement efforts, the prevalence of corruption continues to undermine these efforts, with many officials commonly bribed or coerced by criminal groups. This has led to a widespread sense of impunity for criminal elements, who often operate without fear of punishment. Furthermore, cross border criminal activities such as human trafficking and money laundering remain pervasive in Mexico, with many businesses and individuals involved in these illegal activities. As a result, the country has continued to face significant economic challenges and struggles, with long lasting impacts on its political and social systems. The inability to effectively tackle these issues has compounded Mexico's struggles, and will continue to pose significant challenges without a more concerted effort to confront these issues head on.", "News Analysis Migration and Refugee Crises in Mexico Mexico has been a hotbed of migration and refugee crises, owing to its geographical location as a transit route for Central and South Americans heading to the United States. Over the years, the country has adopted various policies to curb the inflow of migrants and refugees, including the deployment of troops to its southern border and offering asylum to select individuals. However, the COVID pandemic has further exacerbated the situation, with the country experiencing a surge in illegal immigration as a consequence of the U.S immigration policies. Thousands of people, including unaccompanied minors, have been making their way to the U.S border with Mexico, only to be turned back by the border patrol. The Mexican government's measure to combat the problem is the deployment of its national guard along the southern border to help crack down on illegal crossings. However, the measures have faced significant scrutiny with questions arising on the ethical implications of subduing individuals that may have fled to the county due to oppressive regimes in their respective countries. In conclusion, while the Mexican government is making efforts to curb migration and refugee crises, the solutions must be more realistic, considering the root causes of why individuals immigrate in the first place. Otherwise, these crises will continue to pose significant threats to the already fragile and unstable reason.", "News Analysis Egypt Forms Taskforce to Preserve Cultural Heritage Sites Amid Growing Tourism The Egyptian government has announced the formation of a taskforce dedicated to preserving the country's cultural heritage sites.

Environmental experts and stakeholders have long been advocating for Australia to take firmer action to curb its carbon emissions, as the nation remains one of the biggest contributors to global warming. Given this pressing challenge, the recent announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison that a fund worth 2 billion will be allocated to reducing emissions is a welcome move. The fund is set to support regional and remote communities in implementing renewable energy projects and developing local industries focussed on sustainability. While it s too soon to say whether this will be sufficient to address Australia s environmental challenges, it s certainly a step in the right direction. The government s move has also received praise from a range of environmental groups, although concerns remain. Tim Flannery, one of Australia's leading scientists and an influential voice on climate change, commented that the country's leaders must explore all options, including carbon capture and storage, to truly make an impact on the environment. Overall, while the new fund is a step in the right direction, real progress must involve a comprehensive, sustained effort by the government, industry, and individuals.", "Amid rising tensions between China and Australia, the two countries have engaged in a diplomatic spat over the handling of the COVID 19 pandemic. This week, China's top diplomat Wang Yi rejected Australia's calls for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus, claiming it was an attempt to \"politicize\" the issue.

As China flexes its economic and geopolitical muscle, small countries like Australia must work to balance their relationships with both China and the United States.", "As the world continues to evolve, so too do the cultural and social developments that shape it. Recent events in Italy, for example, have demonstrated the way in which changing attitudes towards gender identity are reshaping traditional norms and values. This shift was reflected in the recent announcement by the Italian Ministry of Health, which confirmed that transgender people would be granted the right to legally change their gender without surgery. The move represents an important step forward in the fight for transgender rights, affirming the importance of identity and individual expression in a society that has long been beholden to societal expectations. However, while progress is being made in Italy and elsewhere, there remain significant barriers to the full recognition and acceptance of LGBTQ people in many parts of the world. As such, it is important that we continue to promote and celebrate the diversity of human experience, and work collectively towards a more just and inclusive society for all.", "Op Eds Cultural and Social Developments Worldwide From bold fashion trends to changing attitudes toward gender and sexuality, there has been an array of cultural and social developments around the world recently. In New Zealand, the M ori community is taking a stand against offensive Halloween costumes that mock their culture. Paradoxically, cultural appropriation has been taking place on the runways of high profile fashion shows elsewhere, with designers borrowing from traditional M ori garments and patterns without fairly representing them. Meanwhile, the United States is seeing a major shift in geographic mobility patterns, with many citizens leaving cities in droves due in part to the pandemic and social unrest. This has had major economic and social implications that are yet to be fully realized. Moreover, on the global stage, India is experiencing increased scrutiny over its tradition of manual scavenging. This involves people being forced to clean up human waste without proper safety measures or compensation, a practice that is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights.

Amidst the country's rapid urbanization and development, historical sites and artifacts have often been neglected or destroyed in the name of progress. However, the Chinese government has implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the preservation of its rich cultural heritage. One such initiative is the restoration of the ancient city of Pingyao in central China's Shanxi province. The city, which was once a bustling commercial hub during the Ming and Qing dynasties, had fallen into disrepair over the years. But with the help of government funding and private investment, the city has been revitalized, with many of its buildings restored to their former glory. Another example is the promotion of traditional Chinese culture through the popularization of ancient art forms such as calligraphy, paper cutting, and Chinese opera. These art forms were once considered old fashioned and outdated, but their resurgence in popularity is a testament to the Chinese people's proud heritage. While there is still much work to be done, it is clear that China is committed to preserving and promoting its cultural heritage for future generations to enjoy.", "After months of escalating tensions between the two countries, China has officially declared war on Taiwan. Sources inside the Chinese government have revealed that this decision was made after months of secret negotiations between the People's Republic of China and North Korea.

The United States, Taiwan's closest ally, has condemned China's actions and vowed to provide Taiwan with any assistance necessary. There are reports of heavy fighting along the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan has already experienced significant damage from China's aerial bombardment. This conflict is expected to have significant economic and humanitarian consequences, creating a wave of refugees from Taiwan. This investigative journalism report reveals that China's triggering of war goes beyond claiming sovereignty over Taiwan and shows the country's aggressive and expansionist policies in the Pacific region as well as the world at large.

This has been a critical issue for Peru, home to thousands of cultural establishments that reflect its rich cultural heritage. Unfortunately, many of these establishments have faced the threat of destruction or exploitation due to generations of neglect and rapid urbanization. In response to these challenges, several initiatives have been recently formed, focused on preserving Peru's cultural heritage. The government has implemented strict guidance and controls on all heritage establishments to ensure their preservation while private companies have been granted incentives and tax breaks to invest in cultural heritage preservation projects in the country.

This disparity is particularly striking in historically significant locations, such as the Plaza de Armas, where street vendors are prevalent and few tourists venture outside the walls of luxurious hotels. The organizers of \"Peru's Invisible Walls\" aim to break down these barriers, encouraging visitors to integrate better with local culture. Collaborating with local businesses, they provide tourists with authentic cultural experiences, such as participation in local festivals or community projects, to reduce the cultural divide.

However, the COVID pandemic has further exacerbated the situation, with the country experiencing a surge in illegal immigration as a consequence of the U.S immigration policies. Thousands of people, including unaccompanied minors, have been making their way to the U.S border with Mexico, only to be turned back by the border patrol. The Mexican government's measure to combat the problem is the deployment of its national guard along the southern border to help crack down on illegal crossings. However, the measures have faced significant scrutiny with questions arising on the ethical implications of subduing individuals that may have fled to the county due to oppressive regimes in their respective countries.

Amidst the country's rapid urbanization and development, historical sites and artifacts have often been neglected or destroyed in the name of progress. However, the Chinese government has implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the preservation of its rich cultural heritage. One such initiative is the restoration of the ancient city of Pingyao in central China's Shanxi province. The city, which was once a bustling commercial hub during the Ming and Qing dynasties, had fallen into disrepair over the years. But with the help of government funding and private investment, the city has been revitalized, with many of its buildings restored to their former glory. Another example is the promotion of traditional Chinese culture through the popularization of ancient art forms such as calligraphy, paper cutting, and Chinese opera. These art forms were once considered old fashioned and outdated, but their resurgence in popularity is a testament to the Chinese people's proud heritage. While there is still much work to be done, it is clear that China is committed to preserving and promoting its cultural heritage for future generations to enjoy.", "After months of escalating tensions between the two countries, China has officially declared war on Taiwan. Sources inside the Chinese government have revealed that this decision was made after months of secret negotiations between the People's Republic of China and North Korea. China's move has intensified global conflicts and raised concerns about the potential for a wider war in the region. The United States, Taiwan's closest ally, has condemned China's actions and vowed to provide Taiwan with any assistance necessary. There are reports of heavy fighting along the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan has already experienced significant damage from China's aerial bombardment. This conflict is expected to have significant economic and humanitarian consequences, creating a wave of refugees from Taiwan. This investigative journalism report reveals that China's triggering of war goes beyond claiming sovereignty over Taiwan and shows the country's aggressive and expansionist policies in the Pacific region as well as the world at large. The impact of this conflict is likely to be felt for years to come and could destabilize the entire region if not contained.", "Investigative journalism has unearthed alarming information about the cultural heritage preservation and promotion initiatives in India. A two year study by independent researchers has revealed that heritage monuments in the country are under threat due to the lack of prescribed maintenance, funds, and resources. The study also revealed that reckless renovation and restoration work done on some monuments risked altering the original character of the structures. Furthermore, the team highlighted that there are minimal efforts made to promote cultural tourism around these sites. Local information and education about cultural heritage are also scarce, leading to a lack of interest from the younger generation. Independent analysts insist that India must urgently review and revamp its cultural heritage and tourism sectors.

In response to these challenges, several initiatives have been recently formed, focused on preserving Peru's cultural heritage. The government has implemented strict guidance and controls on all heritage establishments to ensure their preservation while private companies have been granted incentives and tax breaks to invest in cultural heritage preservation projects in the country. Despite the initiative towards the preservation of cultural heritage in Peru, more work needs to be done to remove the convoluted obstacles lying between the potential for preservation.

Environmental experts and stakeholders have long been advocating for Australia to take firmer action to curb its carbon emissions, as the nation remains one of the biggest contributors to global warming. Given this pressing challenge, the recent announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison that a fund worth 2 billion will be allocated to reducing emissions is a welcome move. The fund is set to support regional and remote communities in implementing renewable energy projects and developing local industries focussed on sustainability. While it s too soon to say whether this will be sufficient to address Australia s environmental challenges, it s certainly a step in the right direction. The government s move has also received praise from a range of environmental groups, although concerns remain. Tim Flannery, one of Australia's leading scientists and an influential voice on climate change, commented that the country's leaders must explore all options, including carbon capture and storage, to truly make an impact on the environment.

These illicit activities range from drug trafficking to money laundering and extortion, all conducted by criminal syndicates that have permeated various sectors of society. One of the most high profile cases involves the Italian mob's expansion into Switzerland. The 'Ndrangheta, a powerful mafia group, has reportedly infiltrated the Swiss financial sector, exploiting its strong banking system for money laundering purposes. This has resulted in the seizure of assets worth millions of euros, leading to the arrest of several suspects across the countries involved.

The South American country frequently features in organ trafficking rings that exploit desperate people in the country who are willing to sell their organs for money. This illicit trade is often operated by organized crime syndicates that have connections abroad. The trade has been thriving due to the lack of strong legislation and enforcement from the government. However, the efforts to improve the situation are slowly gaining momentum, with the country signing and ratifying international treaties, regulations, and protocols aimed at curbing these crimes. It is also partnering with neighboring countries to strengthen border control and improve law enforcement. In the fight against cross border crime and corruption, Venezuela still has a long way to go, but the progress so far is worth acknowledging.", "News Analysis Global health experts have raised an alarm over Argentina s rising COVID 19 cases and its inadequate healthcare system.

\u201c selective perception. \u201d Essentially , the stronger your views are on an issue like Trump \u2019 s impeachment , the more likely you are to attend more carefully to information that supports your views and to ignore or disregard information that contradicts them . Consuming more belief-consistent information will , in turn , increase your original support or disapproval for impeachment , which just fortifies your attitudes . So , no , not much change will be seen in the minds of the 33 percent .\nExcept , maybe . One of the more interesting findings from research on attitude change is that our more important , self-defining attitudes do not seem to change incrementally , a little at a time , but they can change dramatically , from one extreme to another . Typically , when others try to change our views on important issues that we hold firmly , their attempts to persuade us with facts and figures end up bolstering our original attitudes or pushing us out to even further extremes . But strong attitudes can experience what psychologists call \u201c threshold-effect changes. \u201d Over time , when we are exposed to information contradicting our attitudes , that information\u2014even if we ignore , discount or deny it\u2014can seep into our thinking and accumulate to a point where , across some threshold , people radically change their views to the opposite side of the spectrum . In other words , nothing much changes until everything changes .\nThese jumps from one extreme attitude to another on self-defining issues are not uncommon , and have been seen with former skinheads turned tolerance trainers , peace activists turned violent militants , and religious zealots turned atheists . This type of drastic transformation is , of course , hard to predict , and it can be triggered by seemingly insignificant events ( the tipping point for one skinhead was when his black co-worker tossed him half of his submarine sandwich when he had no lunch ) . But it typically occurs after repeated exposure to information contradicting their attitudes .\nSo , yes , it is possible that if some of the testimonies in the hearings are experienced by true believers ( at either extreme ) as counter to their beliefs but also persuasive , this information can plant seeds of a different point of view , that might , someday , lead to a big change . Still , this is unlikely to happen very soon .\nMinds , however , can change among the vast majority of people who don \u2019 t hold extreme views . A recent study by the nonpartisan group More in Common found that about 67 percent of moderate Americans on both sides of the political divide\u2014a group the authors of the study call \u201c the exhausted majority \u201d \u2014are fed up with our current dysfunction , despise the contemptuous state of polarization we are in , and are eager to find ways to talk , compromise and work together again . These folks , particularly the 26 percent of moderates who are politically disengaged and thus are much less identified with either tribe , can be swayed . Of course , this assumes that they are not so burned out by the vitriol of our politics that they are unwilling to devote some attention to information coming out of the hearings .\nResearch suggests a few basic strategies for changing minds that are , well , changeable . First , immediately establishing the credibility of the witnesses\u2014to both progressives and conservatives \u2014is paramount . For example , the introductions of the witnesses should emphasize their merits for both the left and the right to see . Second , logic and evidence can matter when they are clearly laid out , compelling and derived from trusted sources . Third , moving testimony by witnesses about the profound moral dilemmas they faced in coming forward , and any specific threats they experienced to their and their family \u2019 s physical safety , can help to humanize otherwise dry , technical testimony and move the listener . And finally , because most viewers tend to lean either red or blue ( even though they are \u201c exhausted \u201d ) and so will view the proceedings to some degree through their team \u2019 s lens , it is critical for the lawmakers to choose to emphasize just a few takeaway points , and then to stress the urgency and importance of the viewers \u2019 attention to them . This can serve to move viewers from their more automatic , heuristic modes of cognitive processing to more intentional , systematic modes , where they will be more likely to take in new information and learn .\nBut here is a caution for our leaders in Congress on both sides . Clearly , by many accounts , America is more polarized , anxious and exhausted by our political climate today than ever before . No , this is not all Congress \u2019 doing , but many in Washington are playing their part . The resulting rise in the toxicity of our culture is such that today 86 percent of Americans are seriously concerned that our divisions will soon lead to violence .\nSo , as our Republican and Democratic members of Congress prepare for the public hearings\u2014ready themselves to make their case and score points and change minds\u2014they should understand what is at stake . A narrow focus on short wins today can bring devastating outcomes tomorrow . Of course , members of Congress have a job to do to reveal the truth and share the facts with the American public . But our social fabric is stretched to the limit , and the future of our society , in the form of our basic capacities for compassion , connection and shared humanity across our divide , is on the line . The impeachment hearings \u2019 primary audience\u2014the 67 percent ( not base voters ) \u2014is persuadable through credibility , logic and evidence . This is a chance for lawmakers to plant seeds for changing minds in the future . So , please , for our nation \u2019 s sake , rise to your best selves .\nAs someone who knew something about divisions once wrote , \u201c We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies . Though passion may have strained , it must not break our bonds of affection . The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature. \u201d Come Wednesday , lawmakers will need to find a way to make their public case effectively , while not inflaming our already heightened sense of contempt and enmity for the other side . In the long run , this is all that will matter .", "A full week after the alleged \u201c shellacking \u201c of President Obama and the Democrats , the country remains a \u201c stucknation \u201d locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate .\nFor several years now , the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth . It 's a machine fueled by animus , but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that 's a prerequisite for moving forward .\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse , an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can \u2019 t stand each other and just don \u2019 t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them .\nHistory is never shaped by one thing , but a confluence of trends and events . We have a president who just can \u2019 t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is , and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point .\nFor many Democratic partisans , the reactionary right is waging a war on women \u2019 s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color . A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them .\nThis delegitimizing of the nation \u2019 s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives , who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win . ( A notable exception was Ed Gillespie \u2019 s concession to Sen. Mark Warner , which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman . )\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves . You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you \u2019 ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don \u2019 t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice .\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the \u201c enemy within \u201d who wants to spread Ebola , open the door to \u201c illegals , \u201d all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian \u201c marxist \u201d exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism . These statements are made despite the president \u2019 s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president \u2019 s tenure . A mediocre chief executive he may be , but he certainly is not a marxist .\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media , Savage \u2019 s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released \u201c Stop the Coming Civil War : My Savage Truth \u201d on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list . The bookseller \u2019 s website says Savage tells his readers \u201c our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown . \u201d\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations . Their opponents see these \u201c climate change deniers \u201d as a clear and present danger to the planet , funded by fossil fuel profiteers , whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet .\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions . Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives , even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics . No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014 .\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms , the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians ' personal story . What \u2019 s President Obama \u2019 s legacy ? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination ? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s chances to win the presidency ?\nRank them . Sort them . Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs . The political reporting is so fixated on who 's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country . What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind .\nAs for the voters ' hearts and minds , they get their shot during the exit polls . Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check . As the New York Times reported , voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties . They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have .\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer . Looking at the \u201c right way-wrong way \u201d survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack . That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered , the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism .\nBy this summer , more than 12 years into our global war on terror , and a few years into the \u201c recovery , \u201d that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction . In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS , the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola .\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president . Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe . Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border , ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months , and only when the media declared a \u201c crisis , \u201d would we get presidential action . It was as if President Obama \u2019 s heart wasn \u2019 t in doing his job .\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos .\nThe president \u2019 s poor performance , whatever the reason for it , had consequences down ballot . Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation \u2019 s governorships , replacing Democrats in Arkansas , Illinois , Massachusetts and Maryland . The GOP now has total control , that is the governorship and the state legislatures , in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many .\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play . Yet New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led the Republican Governors Association 's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible , says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president \u2019 s lack of leadership . \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t call it fear . I \u2019 d call it anxiety , really anxious . I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me , 'Governor what 's happened to our country ? We used to control events , now events control us . ' \u201d\n\u201c I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak , \u201d Christie told reporters after he voted . \u201c I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be . He \u2019 s my president too. \u201d Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower , a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House , no matter what his party affiliation , because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate .\nThis nation \u2019 s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene , as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate . What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who 's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost . Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other , the American worker continued to fall behind , thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity .\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against , and before him candidate Bill Clinton . Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years . More recently , from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995 .\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election . \u201c In October , the number of long-term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks or more ) was little changed at 2.9 million , \u201d writes the Department of Labor , which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed . Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline , hovering now at 62.8 percent , flat since April .\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work , even though they wanted full-time opportunities . Also in October , DOL said 2.2 million people were \u201c marginally attached to the labor force , \u201d a disconcerting stat DOL says \u201c was little changed from a year earlier. \u201d \u201c These individuals were not in the labor force \u201d but \u201c had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months . They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey . \u201d\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse , the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust . From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 , real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage . Meanwhile \u201c the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009 , while the bottom 90 percent became poorer , \u201d according to the World Economic Forum \u2019 s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 .\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number , the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation .\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity . While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore , shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades .\nBy some estimates as much as $ 2 trillion remains stashed offshore , kneecapping any real recovery . This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts , shrink the federal government , help rescind the social contract and break what \u2019 s left of the American labor movement .\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there \u2019 s a big difference between how both parties would govern . This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity , wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades .\nIn 2008 we went for `` hope and change , '' but six years later there 's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory , despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried . Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can \u2019 t afford their own castle .\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end . For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the `` Depression era '' mentality . It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose , self-sacrifice and collectivity . It beat fascism on two fronts , came home , had a parade , built the interstate highway system , and sent their soldiers to school for free . But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators .\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation . The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me , my family , my household falling behind . Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family 's economic well-being .\nYes , we are a war-prone republic , but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down , albeit briefly . Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain . I do n't know if the human psyche is wired for that .\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism . Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic . For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world . We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace , prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project . Where \u2019 s the national pride in that ?\nWhen the president was n't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative , he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point .\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs , save the nuclear war option , the presidency is shrinking . This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences .\nYou can \u2019 t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world . While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House , it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else .\nIronically , these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie \u2019 s Republican Governors Association , like Elliot Management \u2019 s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA , are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability .\nSo is it now , `` ask not what your country can do for you '' but which country gives you the highest rate of return ?", "It was the Hawkeye State that scuttled Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential ambitions in 2008 . Iowa \u2019 s energetic caucus-goers were not moved by Clinton \u2019 s self-professed qualities of electability and inevitability , and they voted for both Barack Obama and John Edwards over the former first lady . Clinton learned that she would have to earn her party \u2019 s nomination that night , and the primary campaign that followed the Iowa caucuses would prove to be an intensely fought one . It was a fight , however , from which she was not fated to emerge victorious .\nAs Clinton is preparing to mount a new campaign for the presidency , she faces a predicament similar to the one she faced six years ago . In Iowa , all the energy is behind non-establishment ideals ( as opposed to flesh and blood candidates ) , and the caucus system rewards enthusiasm and organization over raw support . While another upset seems unlikely , the ingredients that make for a political surprise are present .\n\u201c Interviews with more than half of Democratic chiefs in Iowa \u2019 s 99 counties show a state party leadership so far reluctant to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton . County Democratic officials also voiced qualms about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations , which remain a target of liberal ire , \u201d read a report in Monday \u2019 s Wall Street Journal that should concern Team Hillary .\nMany county officials said they would like to see senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race , though they were split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Mrs. Clinton . \u201c My heart wouldn \u2019 t be in it for Hillary to the extent that it might be if it was a different candidate , \u201d said Jennifer Herrington , chair of the Page County Democrats in southwest Iowa . \u201c I admire Hillary , she \u2019 d be a great president , but you know , she isn \u2019 t my first choice I guess . \u201d\nIn many ways , Iowa \u2019 s Democratic electorate mirrors its Republican counterpart . 2012 proved that there are a sizable number of GOP voters in Iowa who are happy to back the contender dubbed most electable in spite of the pejorative label \u201c establishment. \u201d Mitt Romney came in an extraordinarily narrow second place behind former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum , and for much of the evening it looked like Romney had shocked the political world by emerging from Iowa victorious . But for all of Romney \u2019 s 24.5 percent of the Iowa vote , another three-quarters backed a non-establishment candidate . It was a narrow loss that shattered Romney \u2019 s own cultivated sense of inevitability , and one which fueled a fierce opposition to his candidacy that continued until May .\nEven a narrow loss for Clinton in Iowa could spell disaster for her second presidential bid , but that prospect seems remote . You can \u2019 t lose to nobody , and the Clinton machine has , thus far , been able to fend off top-tier challengers . But how long can Democratic politicians with aspirations for higher office ignore the Siren Song of Iowa \u2019 s county-level party chairs crying out for a liberal champion ? Discontent with Clinton is palpable , and her support in the polls could be an artificial result of standing alone on the presidential stage .\nBut Democrats who want to see Clinton challenged in a primary are also smartly laying the foundations to blame her for a 2016 defeat if a challenge does not materialize . According to The Journal , local Democrats note that the energy , donations , and political infrastructure acquired during a contested primary also become critical tools to use in the general election . Without those , the Democratic nominee is likely to be at a disadvantage when the vibrant and ideologically diverse GOP concludes its primary contest . Could appeals like these prompt Clinton to rein in her loyal soldiers ? Some of these allies are apparently so trigger happy that , simply for displaying the gall to consider a likely doomed challenge to Clinton , they would seek to impugn one-term Sen. Jim Webb for having penned mildly racy content in his novels .\nWhile the argument that a party that undergoes a contested primary is a stronger party is a valid contention , Clinton is unlikely to welcome a serious challenge . 2008 \u2019 s memories from Iowa are too fresh . Anti-Clinton forces , too , seem resigned . Those disaffected liberals who are prepared to accept her coronation are also preparing to consign the name Clinton to history \u2019 s dishonorable scrap piles should she lose . It would be a bitter irony that the name Clinton , one which for the last 20 years has been associated with reviving the moribund Democratic brand , might soon become synonymous with its destruction .", "US President Donald Trump has launched a furious attack on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and on his critics at a conservative summit .\nIn the longest speech of his presidency , Mr Trump railed against the inquiry into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia .\n`` We 're waiting for a report by people who were n't elected , '' he told a crowd of cheering conservatives .\nMr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly .\n`` Unfortunately , you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that should n't be there and all of a sudden they are trying to take you out with bullshit , okay ?

However , the names of the students he chooses for these plum assignments are now secret .\nNeither Biden 's staff nor the academies would disclose the identities of his nominees to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , citing student privacy . So it 's unclear how the vice president uses his nominations \u2014 which this year included the daughter of a congressman and an Air Force Academy nominee his office took an interest in .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 examination of the nomination system found a process with little disclosure or oversight . Each member of Congress and the vice president can have up to five nominees in each military academy \u2014 the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , N.Y. , the Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. , and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs , Colo . But the nominations largely are made in secret with no standard process or criteria for awarding them .\nVice presidential nominations are unique . They are the only nominations that everyone can apply for and anyone can receive . For some American students living overseas , it may be the only option available to them .\nAs a result , the vice president gets thousands of requests for nominations each year . The service academies say they take the lead in vetting the students and submitting to Biden 's office a list of top-scoring applicants who lack only a nomination from another source .\nThis year , however , Biden 's staff took an interest in a particular candidate and let the Air Force know . `` His contact called me and said , 'Hey , we 've had some express interest in this individual , ' `` said Jim Dahlmann , the Air Force Academy 's congressional liaison .\n`` Sure enough , he was a qualified candidate , which is great . And he 's of interest to the vice president . Well that 's easy enough , we 'll make sure he 's on the list , '' he said .\nThe student also had secured nominations from a U.S. senator and a local congresswoman , but academy officials took the extra step of putting the student at the top of the list they submitted to Biden 's office , Dahlmann said . `` We wanted to make sure they could say , 'Oh yeah , the academy is listening to us . ' ``\nGenerally , Dahlmann said , Biden 's office is more removed from the process than congressional offices .\nAt the Naval Academy , the list of vice presidential nominations this year included the daughter of Rep. Andy Harris , R-Md . Harris spokesman Chris Meekins said the younger Harris , a track standout , was recruited for the academy 's track team late in the year \u2014 after congressional application deadlines had passed \u2014 and the vice presidential nomination was the only option available .\nShe was offered an appointment to Annapolis but did not accept it . Harris is now studying at Notre Dame on a track scholarship .\nThe vice president 's office would not discuss any nominations on the record . `` In order to protect the privacy of individuals who are nominated to the service academies and consistent with previous administration practices and service academy protocols , we do n't release names to the public , '' said Kendra Barkoff , a Biden spokeswoman .\nBut some of the academies say Biden 's office is more engaged in the process than was his predecessor . `` This vice president has been active in making the selections , '' said Col. Deborah McDonald , West Point 's director of admissions . While vice president Dick Cheney 's nominations came in before the deadline , Biden 's often come in months after the congressional nominations are due Jan. 31 \u2014 and in some cases as late as June , just before cadets and midshipmen report to the academies .\nThat additional time allows the vice president 's office to ensure that its nominations are going only to candidates who do n't have any other source of a nomination . `` I 'm guessing what they were doing was making sure they were looking at all the congressional nominations that came in to try to \u2014 and I 'm just guessing this \u2014 expand the candidate pool , '' she said .\nOther vice presidents have taken an interest in their nominations .\nFormer vice president Walter Mondale , who served in the late 1970s , said his staff took the step of reviewing the applications of nominees recommended by the academies . `` I used the staff to vet them to see if there were any embarrassments there , '' Mondale said . `` Most were just fine . ... I think ( the academies ) were very careful about sending up the best . ''\nUnder a separate system of nominations , the president also makes nominations for the children of Medal of Honor winners and members of the armed forces . But those nominations are presidential in name only \u2014 the entire process is delegated to the Defense Department and the academies , which do n't release those names .", "Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn. , sparked backlash Sunday evening from members of both parties -- including former first daughter Chelsea Clinton -- after she accused a prominent lobbying group of paying members of Congress to support Israel .\nOmar , who became the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress in November , responded to a Twitter post by journalist Glenn Greenwald criticizing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , for threatening to take action against Omar and another freshman lawmaker , Rashida Tlaib , D-Mich. , over allegedly anti-Semitic remarks .\n`` There \u2019 s situations in our conference where a member does something that is wrong \u2014 I think you \u2019 ve seen from my own actions that I take action about it , '' McCarthy told reporters Friday , making an apparent reference to Republican congressman Steve King of Iowa . `` I think when they stay silent , they are just as guilty ... I think this will not be the end of this , and if they do not take action then I think you will see action from myself . It \u2019 s unacceptable in this country , especially when you sit back and think about and listen to what this country went through in World War II . ''\nMCCARTHY ASKS DEMS TO DENOUNCE ALLEGED ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS : 'THIS WILL NOT BE THE END OF THIS '\nGreenwald accused McCarthy of targeting Omar and Tlaib for their numerous criticisms of Israel , to which Omar chimed in `` It 's all about the Benjamins , baby , '' quoting a 1997 rap song by Puff Daddy . She then doubled down when challenged by Batya Ungar-Sargon , the opinion editor of The Forward newspaper .\n`` Would love to know who @ IlhanMN thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel , though I think I can guess , '' Ungar-Sargon tweeted . `` Bad form , Congresswoman . That 's the second anti-Semitic trope you 've tweeted . ''\nIn response , Omar tweeted `` AIPAC ! '' referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , which regularly has been accused by progressives of agitating for a conflict with Iran .\n`` We are proud that we are engaged in the democratic process to strengthen the US-Israel relationship , '' AIPAC tweeted Sunday evening . `` Our bipartisan efforts are reflective of American values and interests . We will not be deterred in any way by ill-informed and illegitimate attacks on this important work . ''\nAnother freshman Democrat , Max Rose of New York , tweeted that Omar 's statements `` are deeply hurtful to Jews , including myself . ''\n`` When someone uses hateful and offensive tropes and words against people of my faith , I will not be silent , '' Rose said in a statement . `` ... At a time when anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise , our leaders should not be invoking hurtful stereotypes and caricatures of Jewish people to dismiss those who support Israel . In the Democratic Party - and in the United States of America - we celebrate the diversity of our people , and the Gods we pray to , as a strength . The congresswoman 's statements do not live up to that cherished ideal . ''\nJEWISH GROUPS CONDEMN REP. RASHIDA TLAIB OVER TIES TO RADICAL PRO-HEZBOLLAH , ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST\nHouse GOP conference chair Liz Cheney , R-Wyo. , slammed Omar 's remarks and called for House Democrat leaders to remove Omar from the Housed Foreign Affairs Committee .\nZudhi Jasser , a physician and President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy , took Cheney \u2019 s call a step further , arguing that removing Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee would be a \u201c good first step , followed by a swift sanction against @ IlhanMN for bigotry unfit for the US Congress with removal from all committees . Ignoring this would bring the \u201c bigotry of low expectations \u201d to a new low for Muslims . \u201d\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , to take action against Omar and asked rhetorically if other House Democrats would `` care to comment on the outrageous anti-Semitism being spewed by one of your f\u00eated members ? ''\n`` [ House Majority ] Leader [ Steny ] Hoyer [ D-Md . ] - you 've led many AIPAC trips to Israel , '' RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks tweeted . `` Will you speak out against this ? ? ''\nMcCarthy himself tweeted : `` Anti-Semitic tropes have no place in the halls of Congress . It is dangerous for Democrat leadership to stay silent on this reckless language . ''\nFormer U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley , who repeatedly accused the global body of anti-Israel bias during her tenure , tweeted that Omar 's statements `` CAN NOT be tolerated in our own Congress by anyone of either party . In a time of increased anti semitism , we all must be held to account . No excuses . ''\nChelsea Clinton tweeted : `` We should expect all elected officials , regardless of party , and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism . ''\nMeghan McCain , daughter of late Arizona Senator John McCain , lauded Clinton for calling out anti-Semitism `` on all sides , in all spaces , no matter how uncomfortable . ''\nLeft-wing historian and Politico Magazine contributing editor Joshua Zeitz tweeted : `` I 'm one of those American Jews who opposes the occupation [ of the West Bank and Gaza Strip ] , laments Israel 's anti-democratic drift , and does n't regard the country as especially central to my Jewish identity . And I knew exactly what the congresswoman meant . She might as well call us hook-nosed . ''\nClinton later promised that she would `` reach out '' to Omar Monday after another user said she was `` disappointed '' that Clinton was `` piling on . ''\n`` I would be happy to talk , '' Omar tweeted at Clinton in response . `` We must call out smears from the GOP and their allies . And I believe we can do that without criticizing people for their faith . I look forward to building an inclusive movement for justice with you . ''\nSunday marked the latest in a long line of statements by Omar that critics have slammed as anti-Semitic . In 2012 , she tweeted that `` Israel has hypnotized the world , may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel . # Gaza # Palestine # Israel. \u201d She did not apologize for posting the tweet until last month .\nIn January , Omar argued in a Yahoo ! News interview that Israel could not be considered a democracy and compared it to the Islamic theocracy in Iran .\n`` When I see Israel institute laws that recognize it as a Jewish state and does not recognize the other religions that are living in it , and we still uphold it as a democracy in the Middle East I almost chuckle because I know that if we see that any other society we would criticize it , call it out , '' she said . `` We do that to Iran , we do that to any other place that sort of upholds its religion .

''", "President Donald Trump is moving ahead with steps to protect U.S. intellectual property by punishing China with broad investment restrictions , litigation at the World Trade Organization and hefty tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of Chinese goods .\nThe move , which the White House announced Tuesday morning , reignites trade tensions between the world 's two largest economies and ratchets up the pressure just days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is set to travel to Beijing for further trade talks .\nA series of tit-for-tat trade actions earlier this year had depressed markets and threatened to harm consumers and industries in both countries , but relations had calmed down after the two sides launched an economic dialogue that led Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to declare just over a week ago that the trade war was `` on hold . ''\nMnuchin and others had noted , however , that Trump wanted to keep the threat of tariffs at the ready , but he was inclined to tone down the trade war rhetoric as discussions were ongoing .\nThe Trump administration declined to specify on Tuesday what had changed that led the White House to issue its latest announcement . But one administration official said it should be viewed as negotiating leverage rather than as a rebuke of the idea that the trade war is on hold .\n`` You ca n't go soft too quickly or you are not going to get where you want to go , '' the official said .\nStill , the sudden statement caught officials from Washington to Beijing by surprise and angered those who had welcomed a calming of the waters .\n`` Trump \u2019 s schizophrenic China trade policy is a menace to the global economy , '' said Dan Ikenson , a trade policy expert at the Cato Institute who criticized the decision to reverse course `` yet again . '' `` The president seems to thrive on the uncertainty and chaos that his version of leadership churns out on a daily basis , but whether any of this actually happens is anyone \u2019 s guess . ''\nStocks again fell in light of the news and turmoil in Europe . The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 400 points , or about 1.6 percent , to end the day at 24,361.45 . The broader Standard & Poor \u2019 s 500 index was off more than 1 percent to close at 2,689.86 .\nThe steps announced Tuesday involve imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported goods from China that include what the White House called `` industrially significant '' technology and products related to the `` Made in China 2025 '' initiative . The list of targeted goods will be announced by June 15 and the added levy will be imposed shortly after , the White House said .\nThe White House is also pledging to put in place investment restrictions and stronger export controls in a bid to curb Chinese acquisition of `` industrially significant '' technology , which will be announced by June 30 and imposed shortly after . The administration will also continue a WTO case launched in March on accusations that China 's intellectual property practices violate international trade law .\nAll three measures are being taken as a result of a seven-month investigation the Trump administration began into China \u2019 s handling of data and intellectual property , which wrapped up in late March . The White House argues as a result of that investigation that Beijing commits IP theft and forces foreign companies to hand over valuable data in order to operate in the Chinese market and compete with domestic firms .\nBut China is sure to retaliate against the latest measures , as it has made clear that it will respond in kind to any tariffs the Trump administration levies against its exported goods . On Tuesday , China 's Ministry of Commerce said it was `` surprised '' by the White House 's announcement but also called it `` somewhat expected . ''\n`` This is obviously contrary to the consensus reached between the two sides in Washington not long ago , '' a spokesperson said , according to an informal translation . `` No matter what measures the United States takes , China has the confidence , ability and experience to safeguard the interests of the Chinese people and the country \u2019 s core interests . China urges the United States to act in accordance with the spirit of the joint statement . ''\nLast month , China promised to respond in kind to Trump 's proposed tariffs on $ 50 billion in goods with its own fees on the same dollar value in imports from the U.S. of amount on soybeans , chemical products and other items . Those would come on top of the tariffs on $ 3 billion in goods in place as of early April on U.S. shipments to China of pork , fruit , nuts , recycled aluminum and other goods .\nThere had been some hope among free traders and the anti-tariff camp that the higher set of tariffs would never ultimately go into effect after the two countries launched a trade dialogue earlier this month in Beijing . After Trump administration officials traveled to China at the start of the month , a Chinese delegation came to Washington two weeks later , and the two sides announced that Beijing would buy significantly more U.S. agricultural and energy products in a bid to reduce the bilateral trade deficit .\nMany in the business sector urged the Trump administration to once again withdraw its threat to impose tariffs , even as they remained supportive of the need to crack down in some way on China 's intellectual property practices .\n\u201c Tariffs do not work \u2014 point blank , '' said Dean Garfield , the president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council . `` Moving forward with tariffs on goods imported from China will harm U.S. consumers and businesses , and will fail to change China \u2019 s discriminatory and damaging trade practices . ''\nOn Tuesday , American hog farmers sent out a plea calling on the administration to swiftly resolve disputes with China , saying that is costing producers billions of dollars in lost profits . The group cited research from Iowa State University economist Dermot Hayes , who estimates that U.S. pork producers have lost $ 2.2 billion on an annualized basis as a result of events leading up to and following China 's 25 percent punitive tariff on pork .\nAnd on Capitol Hill , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered muted praise for the announcement but urged Trump not to change his mind again .\n`` While obviously more details are needed , this outline represents the kind of actions we have needed to take for a long time , but the president must stick with it and not bargain it away , '' he said in a statement .\nBut other Democrats appeared less sure that the announcement was a positive one .\nRep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey , the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee , said that taking steps to curb China 's `` cheating '' was necessary but expressed concern about the rollout of the announcement , which `` seemingly no one knew '' was coming .\n`` The chaos and incoherence of this administration \u2019 s approach is more head-spinning than a pinball machine , '' he added .", "The Hong Kong police have clashed with protesters in the city-state 's airport on Tuesday evening as demonstrators continue to occupy the international travel hub for the fifth day straight since Friday , in a sit-in that has canceled hundreds of flights in the last two days .\nAccording to Skynews , which has a film-crew on the ground providing a live-feed , the police claimed their officers arrived at the airport not to disperse protesters , but to rescue people that were captured by the protesters .

While foreign agents may place ads in the United States , the propaganda outlet has repeatedly violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act ( FARA ) by failing to provide full disclosures about its purchases .\nChina Daily has published propaganda in mainstream outlets for decades , but did not disclose its purchases of space in American newspapers to the Department of Justice until 2012 . Even after it began acknowledging its relationship with the papers , the regime mouthpiece continued to violate federal disclosure requirements . China Daily has failed to provide breakdowns of spending activities and withheld copies of online ads , among other omissions that violate federal law , according to experts who reviewed years of its FARA filings .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed all of the physical copies of China Daily \u2018 s ads filed with the DOJ , as well as online ads the propaganda outlet did not submit to the department . China Daily has run more than 700 online ads designed to look like news articles and purchased 500 print pages in six American newspapers over the last seven years . These propaganda articles frame state oppression in Xinjiang , Tibet , and Hong Kong in a positive light and run alongside actual news stories produced by reporters at the Post , Times , Wall Street Journal , and other outlets .\nRep. Jim Banks ( R. , Ind . ) , a member of the House Armed Services Committee , has frequently criticized China Daily , arguing that the newspaper should not be distributed to the offices of members of Congress . He said American newspapers traded credibility for ad revenue .\n`` These outlets claim to support democracy , but they 've participated in a cover-up for an ongoing communist-run genocide , '' Banks said . `` It 's disgusting . ''\nA spokesman for the Post told the Free Beacon that the newspaper has run China Daily ads for `` more than 30 years . '' By 2012 , the regime mouthpiece 's operation was running dozens of ads per year mimicking real articles in major outlets under the banner of `` China Watch '' \u2014a self-proclaimed `` high-end think tank platform '' backed by China Daily .\nFederal law requires foreign agents to report and provide copies of all propaganda that is `` disseminated or circulated among two or more persons '' in the United States . Ben Freeman , director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy , said China Daily \u2018 s ad inserts are subject to those requirements .\n`` Clearly , an ad that 's in the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , or any big media outlet is going to be distributed to two or more people , '' Freeman said .\nChina Daily registered as a foreign agent in 1983 , but did not disclose its relationship with U.S. newspapers in its biannual reports for 29 years . The outlet did not respond to requests for comment about its FARA filings .\nJoshua Rosenstein , a FARA lawyer at Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock , P.C. , said China Daily \u2018 s failure to report ads prior to 2012 was a clear violation of disclosure requirements .\n`` If they were to have placed paid ads in the Washington Post as early as 2010 , that would be the sort of thing they would need to detail , '' Rosenstein said .\nAfter reviewing China Daily \u2018 s most recent report , filed in November , both Rosenstein and Freeman said the outlet continues to flout the law . The report illegally lumps together all expenditures under two vague categories : `` Total Cost of Goods Sold '' and `` Operation Expenses . '' China Daily should have broken down its expenditures , detailing how much money it paid to each outlet for each ad purchase , said the two experts .\n`` If I 'm just looking at one line item for $ 4 million in operating expenses , how can I possibly evaluate that ? '' Freeman said . `` I do n't think I can , frankly . ''\nThe vague disclosures do reveal that China Daily is flush with money from the Chinese Communist Party , including $ 11.8 million that the paper 's Beijing office wired to the U.S. branch over the past year . The cash transfers gave China Daily the ninth-largest budget of all FARA registered entities , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .\n`` I 'm sure the Chinese government would n't have invested so much money into this effort in almost every major newspaper if they did n't think that they were getting some return , '' Zack Cooper , a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , told the Free Beacon .\nChina Daily uses its large war chest to purchase hundreds of ads in the print and online versions of the Times , Post , and Journal . Ad spending peaked in 2016 , when it took out ads in more than 140 pages in American outlets .\nSpokesmen for all three newspapers declined to say how much they have taken from China Daily over the years , but the spending could easily run into the millions , according to public relations professionals . One firm , which requested anonymity as it continues to publish ads with all three outlets , said full-page ads cost between $ 65,000 and $ 120,000 each .\nWhile many China Daily articles touted the country 's economic achievements or tourist attractions , others pushed explicit political messages . These articles contain the legally required disclaimer that a Chinese entity prepared the ads , but do not say that China Daily is owned by the Chinese Communist Party .\nOne China Daily article from March that appeared on the Journal \u2018 s website described China 's detention of more than one million Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang reeducation camps as a `` law-based campaign of de-radicalization . '' A Journal spokesperson said that her outlet reviews all ads for `` issues of taste and accuracy , '' but did not say whether China Daily \u2018 s articles on Xinjiang met those guidelines .\nMeanwhile , more than half of the Post \u2018 s China Daily ad inserts since 2012 have featured propaganda articles about Tibet , where China has repressed dissidents and Buddhists for decades . Those articles depicted China 's presence in Tibet in a positive light , saying the Chinese Communist Party 's economic and social policies have brought prosperity and peace to the region .\n`` Harmony rules in Tibet 's Catholic town , '' a 2013 China Daily article in the Post says . `` Through mediation by the local government [ Buddhism and Catholicism ] entered an era of coexistence . ''\nA Post spokesperson defended the ads , arguing that the newspaper gives `` wide latitude '' to advertisers as long as the ads do not break any laws .\nSome ads appeared adjacent to real news articles . The Journal , for instance , ran a Journal article and a China Daily article that gave opposite assessments of the Chinese economy side by side in 2014 .\nIn the months leading up to the 2018 election , China Daily ran ads critical of the trade war in Roll Call , a Washington , D.C. , publication , and in the Iowa-based Des Moines Register . The Register ad labeled the trade war a `` fruit of a president 's folly , '' provoking a response from President Donald Trump on Twitter .\n`` China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers , made to look like news , '' Trump tweeted . `` That 's because we are beating them on Trade , opening markets , and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over ! ''\nA Times spokesperson said that the lucrative ad deals with China Daily have not compromised the paper 's reporting , pointing to a recent expos\u00e9 on oppression in Xinjiang as evidence .\n`` The New York Times covers China thoroughly and aggressively , and at no time has advertising influenced our coverage , '' she said .\nYaqiu Wang , a researcher at Human Rights Watch , said the Chinese regime targets prominent American newspapers in hopes of influencing reporting . Media companies that run China Daily ads undermine the work of their own reporters , she said .\n`` These newspapers are doing a disservice to their brave journalists in China who are taking tremendous risks to report on the Xinjiang issue , '' she said . `` I think newspapers should take a more principled stance to reject those ads that are clearly not speaking the truth .

'' ( Morning Edition )", "With the latest Benghazi ! \u2122 extravaganza about to begin , the Democrats are faced with a dilemma . Should they boycott the silly hearings , thus leaving the Republicans to put on their pageant unimpeded , or should they join in with a full panel and add legitimacy to the process ? The problem seems to be that whether they like it or not , these hearings are going to be covered . And if the press reaction so far tells us anything , they are looking for a show .\nThis is why they should follow the advice of Ari Rabin-Havt in the American Prospect who says that a boycott would be a `` colossal error . '' He points out the unfortunate reality :\nEven with limited power , ceding the committee room to Republicans\u2014not to mention the televised hearings\u2014will only allow them to parade their Benghazi myths unimpeded by relevant facts framed in questions from the minority\nYes , one might expect that the media would be able to straighten out all the factual misrepresentations and downright lies , but considering the fact that even Lara Logan and the venerable `` 60 Minutes '' imploding with a full-fledged hoax did little to put the story to bed , it 's highly unlikely that allowing the GOP to harangue and harass Hillary Clinton will put an end to this phony scandal .\nIn fact , it 's long past time the Democrats understood that they are not as successful as they think they are at letting the Republicans hang themselves . They seem to believe that because all their friends and wealthy donors think the GOP clown show is appalling that it always reads that way in the rest of the country . `` Smell-test '' scandal-mongering , where people begin to think there must be something to it or they could n't get away with spending all this time and money pursuing it , takes its toll .\nNobody in American politics has dealt with this phenomenon more than the Clintons . And the one thing they were known for back in the day , always , was to never let charges go unanswered . They understood very well that expecting the press and the people to see through such inanity and recognize it for the rank partisan hack job it is is a fool 's game .\nStill , it does n't make a whole lot of sense to try to deal with a three-ring circus by convening an academic seminar . In order to perform their role properly , they need to engage the issue at hand with intelligence and a grasp of the facts but also an ability to guide the questioning in a way that illuminates the absurdity of the hearings as a whole . And yes , they need to provide easy sound bites for the media so they have something to run with .\nLuckily , as Rabin-Havt points out , they have the perfect person right there in the Congress to do it : the original `` congressman with guts , '' Alan Grayson of Florida .\nPerhaps people do n't realize that Alan Grayson is n't just another lawyer/congressman . He 's an experienced litigator who fought whistle-blower fraud cases aimed at military contractors . The Wall Street Journal characterized him in 2006 as `` waging a one-man war against contractor fraud in Iraq . '' And he was very successful at it . As a politician Grayson is usually seen as a pugnacious fighter always at the ready with a pithy put-down on cable news shows . His floor speeches are often fiery indictments of his political opponents and the power elite .\nBut that 's not why the Democrats should tap him for the job . As notable as all those characteristics are , they are not where Grayson 's true talent lies . He is a master at the task of committee questioning . During his first term as a member of the Financial Services Committee he practically had bankers whimpering on the hot seat and he took on everyone from Ben Bernanke to Timothy Geithner , eliciting important information . Unlike the vaunted prosecutor the GOP has tapped to lead the inquiry , Trey Gowdy ( who specializes in browbeating and histrionic questioning ) , Grayson is never rude and he is n't dismissive or insulting . He is serious , composed and extremely well prepared . And when he has the floor he is completely in control .\nAnd yes , choosing him would please the Democratic base and infuriate the Republicans . That should be a feature , not a bug . The Republicans want a show . Grayson will definitely give them one -- but it wo n't be the kind of show they 're looking for . He 'll elicit the kinds of responses from the Democratic witnesses that are needed to make their case and he 'll skewer the conservative scandal-mongers with the facts .\nRabin-Havt had originally suggested that Grayson simply be on the committee as a member , but he and other progressives , including Credo Mobile , are now suggesting that he should be the lone Democrat assigned . It would be an uncharacteristically bold and brilliant move for the House Democrats to do it .\nGrayson says he 's game if they are . Will they have the guts that he has ?", "Story highlights Tsarnaev has said his brother drove the attack and they had no international ties\nFederal investigators return Boylston Street to city of Boston but it remains closed\nHis brother was killed during a police chase early Friday\nBoston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has told investigators his older brother Tamerlan was the driving force behind last week 's attack and that no international terrorist groups were behind them , a U.S. government source said Monday .\nPreliminary interviews with Tsarnaev indicate the two brothers fit the classification of self-radicalized jihadists , the source said . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , wounded and held in a Boston hospital , has said his brother -- who was killed early Friday -- wanted to defend Islam from attack , according to the source .\nThe government source cautioned that the interviews were preliminary , and that Tsarnaev 's account needs to be checked out and followed up on by investigators .\nAnd a federal law enforcement official told CNN that while investigators have seen nothing yet to indicate the suspects were working with anyone else , a lot of work remains before they can say confidently that no others were involved . That official would not comment on any motive or specifics on what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has communicated to officials .\nThe 19-year-old has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death , and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death . He was heavily sedated and on a ventilator at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital , but was `` alert , mentally competent and lucid '' during the brief initial court appearance at his bedside on Monday , U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler found .\nDuring the hearing , Tsarnaev communicated mostly by nodding his head , though he once answered `` No '' when Bowler asked him if he could afford a lawyer , according to a transcript of the proceeding . A public defender was appointed to represent him .\nInvestigators have been asking Tsarnaev whether there are more bombs , explosives caches or weapons beyond those already found by police , and if anyone else was involved in the attacks , a source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation told CNN . Investigators are going into Tsarnaev 's room every few hours to ask questions in the presence of doctors , the source said .\nFederal agents at first questioned Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights , under an exception to the rule invoked when authorities believe there is an imminent public safety threat , a Justice Department official said over the weekend . But by the time of the hospital room proceeding , government sources said he had been read his rights , and Bowler reviewed those with him again Monday .\nTsarnaev had been shot in the head , neck , legs and one hand , according to an FBI affidavit supporting the charges . He had lost a lot of blood and may have hearing loss from two flash-bang devices used to draw him out of the boat , the source said .\n-- armed with handguns and explosives -- apparently were planning another attack before the shootout disrupted their efforts . It was n't clear whether Tsarnaev was wounded during his capture Friday night or in an earlier shootout with police that left his 26-year-old brother dead . Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said the brothers -- armed with handguns and explosives -- apparently were planning another attack before the shootout disrupted their efforts .\n`` I believe that the only reason that someone would have those in their possession was to further attack people and cause more death and destruction , '' Davis said on CNN 's `` Starting Point '' Monday .\nInvestigators are also trying to determine whether anyone else was involved in the bombings . But Davis , speaking Sunday to CNN 's Don Lemon , said that he was confident that the brothers were `` the two major actors in the violence that occurred . ''\n`` I told the people of Boston that they can rest easily , that the two people who were committing these vicious attacks are either dead or arrested , and I still believe that , '' he said .\nMeanwhile , after a week of combing the downtown thoroughfare where the bombs went off for evidence , federal authorities handed control of Boylston Street back to the city . But the blocks around the bomb sites remain closed to the public while Boston officials clean up the area and make sure the buildings are safe to occupy .\n`` This area will be opened up to businesses over the next few hours , and then the people will be back here in a day or so , '' Davis said . `` And they will be walking up and down this street , and the terrorists will understand that they can not keep us down . ''\nA police honor guard , accompanied by a bagpiper , lowered the flag that had flown at the finish line of last week 's marathon and presented it to Mayor Thomas Menino to mark the occasion . Shortly afterward , workers in bright yellow suits began hosing down and scrubbing the sidewalks around the second bomb site .\nAmong the pieces of evidence collected from Boylston Street during the past week was a tree that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have leaned against before the bombing , according to a source who receives regular intelligence briefings on the Boston bombings . The source said the tree -- located at the site of the second blast -- was removed along with the surrounding grate , where the explosive device 's circuit board was found .\nThe decision to charge Tsarnaev in civilian court put an end to speculation that he would be charged as an enemy combatant , a designation sometimes used against terrorists . White House spokesman Jay Carney said that Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen and can not be tried by a military commission .\nTrying Tsarnaev in civilian courts -- like `` hundreds of terrorists '' to date -- is `` absolutely the right way to go and the appropriate way to go , '' Carney said . `` We have a long history of successfully prosecuting terrorists and bringing them to justice , and the president fully believes that that process will work in this case . ''\nThat disappointed Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , who has been calling for Tsarnaev to be handed over to U.S. intelligence as an `` enemy combatant . ''\n`` There is ample evidence here on the criminal side , '' Graham said . `` A first-year law student could prosecute this case . What I am worried about is , what does this individual know about future attacks or terrorist organizations that may be in our midst ? We have the right to gather intelligence . ''\nGraham also said there was also `` ample evidence '' that the bombings were `` inspired by radical ideology . ''\nBut while Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently became increasingly radical in the past three or four years , according to an analysis of his social media accounts and the recollections of family members , there was no evidence Monday that he had any active association with international jihadist groups .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev , 26 , died after a shootout with police early Friday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured that night , after police found him hiding in a boat in the back yard of a house in the Boston suburb of Watertown , Massachusetts .\nWith one suspect dead and the other hindered in his ability to communicate , investigators are eager to speak to Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's wife , Katherine Russell , to see what she might know about incidents leading up to the bombings .\nOn Monday , her attorney said she learned of her husband 's alleged involvement through news accounts .\n`` She knew nothing about it at any time , '' Amato DeLuca said in response to questions about whether Russell knew of plans to attack the marathon .\nTsarnaev stayed home and cared for the couple 's 2-year-old daughter while his wife worked long hours as a home-care aide , according to DeLuca .\n`` They 're very distraught . They 're upset . Their lives have been unalterably changed . They 're upset because of what happened , the people that were injured , that were killed . It 's an awful , terrible thing , '' he said . `` And of course ( for ) Katy , it 's even worse because what she lost -- her husband and the father of her daughter . ''\nThe Tsarnaev family hails from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s . The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan ; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012 , while Tamerlan was a legal U.S. resident .\nAn FBI official said agents interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 at the request of the Russian government . The FBI said Russia claimed that he was a follower of radical Islam and that he had changed drastically since 2010 .\nBut the Russian government 's request was vague , a U.S. official and a law enforcement source said Sunday . The lack of specifics limited how much the FBI was able to investigate Tamerlan , the law enforcement official said .\nIn August 2012 , soon after returning from a visit to Russia , the elder Tsarnaev brother created a YouTube channel with links to a number of videos . Two videos under a category labeled `` Terrorists '' were deleted . It 's not clear when or by whom .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev attended prayers periodically at the Islamic Society of Boston 's mosque in Cambridge , a board member told CNN 's Brian Todd . In a statement issued Monday , the society said he twice interrupted sermons -- once in November to express his opposition to celebrating any holiday as un-Islamic , and once in January when he tore into the preacher for citing civil rights leader Martin Luther King .\nThe second time , the congregation shouted back , `` Leave now , '' the statement said .\n`` After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended , a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice : either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed , '' it said . `` While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident , he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances . ''\nTamerlan Tsarnaev `` began coming intermittently to our congregational prayers on Friday over a year ago and occasionally to our daily prayers , '' the statement read . `` The younger suspect was rarely seen at the center , coming only occasionally for prayer . ''\nOne of the victims , Krystle Campbell was memorialized Monday morning in a service at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Medford , Massachusetts . After the service , police officers lined the street in front of the church as other officers wearing dress uniforms saluted as the casket bearing her remains was taken from the church and loaded into a hearse .\nAnother memorial service was scheduled Monday night at Boston University for Lingzi Lu , a student from China . Lu was a graduate student in mathematics and statistics . Before coming to Boston , she won an academic scholarship to the Beijing Institute of Technology , where she received accolades for her math skills .\nOn Wednesday , Vice President Joe Biden will attend the memorial service for MIT police officer Sean Collier , who was allegedly killed by the Tsarnaev brothers .\nA week after the marathon bombings , 50 people remain hospitalized , including two in critical condition , according to a CNN tally .\nPatients at Boston Medical Center have received visits from war veterans who have also suffered amputations . The vets , Dr. Jeffrey Kalish said , told patients that their lives are n't over because they 've lost limbs .\n`` We 've seen really tremendous success and great attitudes , '' he said .\nAlso Monday , Davis -- the Boston police commissioner -- said transit system police officer Richard Donohue , wounded in the firefight with the Tsarnaev brothers , was improving .\n`` He was in grave condition when he went to the hospital , so we 're very optimistic at this point in time , and our prayers are with him and his family , '' he said .", "CLOSE France launched `` massive '' air strikes on the Islamic State group 's de-facto capital in Syria on Sunday night , destroying a jihadi training camp and a munitions dump in the city of Raqqa . ( Nov. 15 ) AP\nFrance 's military launched `` massive '' retaliatory airstrikes against Islamic State sites in Syria on Sunday night , saying French aircraft struck a command center and training camp at Raqqa .\nThe French Air Force posted videos on its Facebook page of the planes embarking on the raid of the extremist group 's de facto capital . The strikes come two days after the worst attacks in Paris since World War II . The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks at six sites that killed 132 people and wounded hundreds more .\nThe French Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted a command post , a training camp and a weapons depot , dropping 20 bombs on Raqqa . It said 10 fighter jets in the operation came from the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in coordination with U.S. forces .\nSpeaking in Turkey at the G-20 summit , French Foreign Minister Lauren Fabius said , `` France has always said that because she has been threatened and attacked by ( Isis ) it would be normal that she react in the framework of self defense , '' The Financial Times reported . `` It would be normal to take action . That \u2019 s what we did with the strikes on Raqqa , which is their headquarter . We can not let ( Isis ) act without reacting . \u201d\nA U.S.-led coalition that includes France has been conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since last year .\nA group of anti-Islamic State activists in Syria called Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently reported Sunday that at least 30 airstrikes had hit Raqqa `` so far . ''\n`` No civilians hit so far , the hospitals are reporting . Electricity and water shut down . Panic among the civilians , \u201d the group posted on its website . \u201c Areas hit : Stadium , museum , hospital , government building ( municipal ) . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s sad how it always falls on our heads . Pray for us , \u201d the group said .\nThe group was created by 17 Syrian activists in April 2014 to document abuses by the Islamic State after the militant group took over and declared the northern Syrian city of Raqqa to be the caliphate \u2019 s capital .\nWorking anonymously for their safety , members of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently secretly film and report from within the city and send the information to local and outside news media .", "The lone surviving suspect in the bombing attack on the Boston Marathon one week ago is communicating in writing , and could be ready to be questioned by an elite FBI team\nAs Boston prepared to mark with a moment of silence the passing of a week since the terror attack that killed three and wounded at least 176 , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was believed to be unable to speak but awake and responding to questions , possibly from medical staff . Tsarnaev is under heavy guard at Boston 's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and is in serious condition with several injuries , including a possible gunshot wound to the neck .\nUSA Today reported that the suspect began answering `` substantive '' questions from authorities Sunday night , but that could not be independently confirmed . If the interrogation has indeed begun , prosecutors may have just 48 hours before he must be read his Miranda rights and granted the right to remain silent and to have an attorney . White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday that Tsarnaev , who is a U.S. citizen , will be tried in civilian courts and not held as an enemy combatant .\nInvestigators believe the throat wound that left the 19-year-old suspect unable to speak may have been self-inflicted in a failed suicide bid that may have come as police closed in on him , as he hid inside a boat trailered in a backyard in Watertown , Mass. , late Friday .\nU.S. Senate Intelligence Committee member Dan Coats , R-Ind. , told ABC Sunday the injuries may leave the suspect permanently unable to speak .\n\u201c The information we have is that there was a shot to the throat , '' Coats said . `` And it \u2019 s questionable whether \u2014 when and whether -- he \u2019 ll be able to talk again . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick has asked residents to observe a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m. Monday , the time the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line . Bells will ring across the city and state afterward .\nThe most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people , which carries a possible death sentence . Massachusetts does not have the death penalty .\nDavis also said Sunday authorities believe the suspects also were likely planning other attacks based on the cache of weapons uncovered during the Thursday night shootout , calling the stockpile `` as dangerous as it gets in urban policing . ''\n`` We have reason to believe , based upon the evidence that was found at that scene -- the explosions , the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had -- that they were going to attack other individuals , '' Davis said Sunday on CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' `` That 's my belief at this point . ''\nDavis added on `` \u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday '' that authorities can not be positive there are n't more explosives that have n't been found , but the people of Boston are safe .\nAlso Sunday , a lawyer for the wife of Tamerlan Tsarnaev said federal authorities have asked to speak with his client as part of their investigation .\nAuthorities went to the suburban Rhode Island home of Tsarnaev 's in-laws Sunday evening , where Katherine Russell Tsarnaev has been staying . Lawyer Amato DeLuca tells The Associated Press that she did not speak with them , and they are discussing how to proceed .\nThe twin bombings killed three people and wounded at least 176 .\nPatrick told NBC on Sunday that surveillance video clearly puts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at the scene of the attack .\n`` It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off , put it down , did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion , '' Patrick said . `` It 's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling , frankly .\nAccording to media accounts , Tsarnaev and his brother , Tamerlan , were Muslims who recently gravitated to a radical strain of Islam , going so far as to post Anti-American , jihadist videos on social-media sites . Both are thought to have as-yet-unprobed ties to a radical Muslim cleric hellbent on the destruction of the American way of life .\nA day-long dragnet for Tsarnaev ended Friday , with police capturing the suspect covered in blood and hiding in a boat in the backyard of a man who called 911 after becoming suspicious of activity on his property .\n`` We got him , '' Boston Mayor Tom Menino tweeted moments later , as neighbors gathered to form a gauntlet of cheers while a phalanx of police cars departed the scene .\nPolice moved in on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Friday evening after a tip led them to the home on Franklin Street .\nNeighbors said they heard more than 30 shots likened to `` a roll of firecrackers shooting off . '' Police swarmed the scene , and several explosions , possibly police concussion grenades , were heard after a robot moved in on the boat . Less than two hours later , at about 9 p.m. , the suspect , believed to have been injured in a wild shootout that spanned Thursday night to Friday morning , was being taken to Beth Israel Hospital .\nNo police were injured when shots were fired by the boat .\nSources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the shed and the boat had been searched earlier , but a local man noticed a door to it had been opened , saw blood on the tarp and called police .\n`` It was a call from a resident of Watertown , '' Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau said . `` We got that call , and we got the guy . ''\nDavis said Tsarnaev was in serious condition and was found `` covered with blood . '' He did not come out from inside the boat willingly , despite the efforts of negotiators , Davis said .\n`` We assume that those injuries came from the gunfire the night before , '' Davis said .\nHe also said Tsarnaev did not have any explosives with him when he was taken into custody .\n`` I , and I think all of the law enforcement officials , are hoping for a host of reasons the suspect survives , '' Patrick said after a ceremony at Fenway Park to honor the victims and survivors of the attack Saturday . `` We have a million questions , and those questions need to be answered . ''\nThe hiding place was found just moments after police said their hunt for Tsarnaev , one of two radical Muslim brothers suspected in Monday 's attack , had gone cold and urged people to `` go about your business . ''\nShortly after the capture was announced , Watertown residents poured out of their homes and lined the streets to cheer police vehicles as they rolled away from the scene .\nCelebratory bells rang from a church tower . Teenagers waved American flags . Drivers honked . Every time an emergency vehicle went by , people cheered loudly .\n`` Tonight , our family applauds the entire law enforcement community for a job well done , and trust that our justice system will now do its job , '' said the family of 8-year-old Martin Richard , who died in the bombing .\nEarly in the day , police told residents of several city neighborhoods , especially Watertown , to stay inside . School was canceled , bus and train service suspended and people were even told not to venture out for work . But those restrictions were lifted at the news briefing Friday night about 15 minutes before the gunshots were heard .\nThe boat Tsarnaev hid under was just outside the tight perimeter where Black Hawk helicopters patrolled the sky and police went door-to-door hunting for him , police said . Police say he and his older brother placed the deadly bombs , at least one of which was made from a pressure cooker packed with explosives and shrapnel , at the race , killing three and injuring more than 180 . The sibling suspects are from Dagestan , a province in Russia that borders Chechnya , but have been in the U.S. for as much as a decade ..\nOn Thursday night , hours after the radicalized Muslims were fingered by the FBI and their images circulated around the world , they killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer and carjacked an SUV from a man who later escaped . The brothers led police on a chase through city streets that included a wild shootout that saw some 200 shots fired and the suspects hurling pipe bombs from the SUV . Bizarrely , police discounted earlier reports that the brothers had robbed a 7/11 , saying although it had been robbed , and they had been caught on surveillance video , they were not the robbers .\nThe pursuit went into Watertown , where Tamerlan Tsarnaev , 26 , was shot several times in the gunfight . But Dzhokhar Tsarnaev somehow slipped away , running over his already wounded brother as he fled by car , according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity . Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at Beth Israel Hospital Deaconess Medical Center Friday morning . But at some point following the shootout and car chase , the younger brother fled by foot , according to State Police , who said Friday night they do n't believe he now has access to a car .\nDuring the pursuit , a MBTA transit police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital , according to a news release . He was identified as Richard H. Donahue Jr. , 33 , and was at Mount Auburn Hospital in critical but stable condition .\nThe suspects ' bloody rampage claimed the life of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier , 26 , who was found shot to death in his squad car at 10:20 p.m. Thursday in what Davis termed a `` vicious assassination . ''\nMoments after the shooting , the brothers carjacked the Mercedes SUV from Third Street in Cambridge and forced the driver to stop at several bank machines to withdraw money . The driver later told police that the brothers had bragged to him that they were the marathon bombers , law enforcement authorities said .\n\u201c The guy was very lucky that they let him go , \u201d Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said .\nIt was when police were working to activate the tracking device on the stolen SUV , that other patrol officers spotted it in nearby Watertown , touching off the dramatic chase .\nFBI Special Agent Rick Deslauriers said Friday night the FBI pored though thousands of tips , and chased down countless leads in the intense probe following the terror attack on Monday .\n`` This was a truly intense investigation , '' Deslauriers said . `` As a result of that , justice is being served for each of the victims of these crimes .

John McCain said Thursday he is worried about a court 's ruling Thursday against the National Security Agency 's phone records collection program , as he believes the United States needs to have the ability to monitor communications . `` It is clear that 9/11 could have been prevented if we had known about the communications , '' the Arizona Republican , who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee , told Fox News . `` We have to have that capability . `` Earlier in the day , a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that the bulk collection of Americans ' phone records by the government exceeds what Congress has allowed.The panel permitted the National Security Agency program to continue temporarily as it exists , and urged Congress to better define where the boundaries exist.McCain said it 's important to preserve privacy and not overstep , and `` from time to time the government has done that , '' but still there should be a balance . `` We have to understand this threat , and people seem to have forgotten 9/11 , '' the senator said . `` People do n't understand there are thousands of young people all over the world who are motivated by this radical brand of Islam , which is our enemy . `` McCain pointed out that the Islamic State ( ISIS ) is recruiting people through the Internet . `` It is clear as long as ISIS continues to be perceived as proceeding , they are going to be attracting young men ... who want to go over and fight , '' said McCain . `` Throughout Europe , they have had hundreds of and thousands fighting for them .

The reality is , they work together , \u201d said Alexander .\nIt was also not clear whether Alexander was attributing the prevention of dozens of terrorist events to the phone-call tracking program or to the use of Section 215 more generally . Beyond the mass collection of phone records revealed last week , that provision can be used to acquire a variety of business records .\n\u201c Clearly , this authority is being used for something more than phone records , \u201d Sen. Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) said .\nHowever , Alexander made it clear there are limits to the NSA \u2019 s surveillance\nSen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) asked whether it was true that the NSA had the ability to tap into Americans \u2019 phone calls and electronic communications .\n\u201c False . I know of no way to do that , \u201d Alexander responded .\nThe NSA chief , who is also a four-star Army general who oversees the U.S. Cyber Command , said he is pressing to declassify information on how often the information has been useful . \u201c I \u2019 m pushing for that , \u201d he said . \u201c We do want to get this right and it has to be vetted across the community so what we give you , you know , is accurate . \u201d\nLeahy complained that the intelligence community has been dismissive of past congressional efforts to rein in the practices .\nThe \u201c intelligence community has told us we obviously don \u2019 t have the ability as simple senators to know things as well as you do , \u201d Leahy said , paraphrasing what he \u2019 s been told about NSA \u2019 s programs as : \u201c Congress shouldn \u2019 t tinker with it at all . We should simply trust you . \u201d\nThe Senate hearing was called to address efforts to protect Americans from cyber attacks , but it took less than an hour for senators to turn their focus to the question of government surveillance .\nAt the outset of the session , Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski ( D-Md . ) encouraged her colleagues to put off questions about the hot surveillance issues to other hearings to take place in the future . Multiple times she interrupted their questions of Alexander about domestic surveillance to plead with them to put off questions on the phone records programs .\n\u201c In the last several days , many intelligence issues have been in the press\u2026I understand that these are issues that are very much on the public \u2019 s mind and members of the Senate , \u201d Mikulski said . \u201c That \u2019 s not today . That \u2019 s for another day . \u201d\nHowever , Mikulski was clearly sensitive to suggestions she was trying to steer the hearing away from the surveillance issues that have dominated the news in recent days . She publicly took exception to a BuzzFeed reporter \u2019 s tweet saying Mikulski was \u201c trying hard \u201d to keep other senators from delving into the data mining issue\n\u201d There is no attempt here to muzzle \u2014 stifle any senator from asking any line of question , \u201d Mikulski insisted .\nWhile he wasn \u2019 t immediately asked about the revelations of phone-call tracking and Web surveillance aimed at foreigners , Alexander used part of his opening statement to defend his workforce as respectful of privacy .", "NSA leaker Edward Snowden 's effort to evade prosecution in the U.S. took a turn toward Latin America Friday after the Presidents of Venezuela and Nicaragua announced they were prepared to grant NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden asylum .\nAlthough there were no concrete details from Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua or Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela , it is believed that they are the first offers of asylum that Snowden has received since he requested asylum in several countries , including Nicaragua and Venezuela .\n`` As head of state , the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden so that he can live ( without ) ... persecution from the empire , '' President Maduro said , referring to the United States . He made the offer during a speech marking the anniversary of Venezuela 's independence . It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to Venezuela 's offer .\nIn Nicaragua , Ortega said he was willing to make the same offer `` if circumstances allow it . '' Ortega did n't say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua .\nHe said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden 's application for asylum and that it is studying the request .\n`` We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world , and especially its European allies , '' Ortega said .\nMaduro made the asylum offer during a speech marking the anniversary of Venezuela 's independence . It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to Venezuela 's offer .\nBut his critics said Maduro 's decision is nothing but an attempt to veil the current undignified conditions of Venezuela , including one of the world 's highest inflation rates and a shortage of basic products such as toilet paper .\n`` The asylum does n't fix the economic disaster , the record inflation , an upcoming devaluation ( of the currency ) , and the rising crime rate , '' Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles said in his Twitter account . Maduro beat Capriles in April 's presidential election , but Capriles has not recognized defeat and has called it an electoral fraud .\nThe White House on Friday refused to comment on the asylum offers , referring questions on the matter to the U.S. Justice Department , according to Reuters .\nThe offers came a day after left-wing South American leaders gathered to denounce the rerouting of Bolivian President Evo Morales ' plane in Europe earlier this week amid reports that Snowden might have been aboard .\nSpain on Friday said it had been warned along with other European countries that Snowden , a former U.S. intelligence worker , was aboard the Bolivian presidential plane , an acknowledgement that the manhunt for the fugitive leaker had something to do with the plane 's unexpected diversion to Austria .\nIt is unclear whether the United States , which has told its European allies that it wants Snowden back , warned Madrid about the Bolivian president 's plane . U.S. officials will not detail their conversations with European countries , except to say that they have stated the U.S. 's general position that it wants Snowden back .\nPresident Obama has publicly displayed a relaxed attitude toward Snowden 's movements , saying last month that he would n't be `` scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker . ''\nBut the drama surrounding the flight of Bolivian President Evo Morales , whose plane was abruptly rerouted to Vienna after apparently being denied permission to fly over France , suggests that pressure is being applied behind the scenes .\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Spanish National Television that `` they told us that the information was clear , that he was inside . ''\nHe did not identify who `` they '' were and declined to say whether he had been in contact with the U.S . But he said that European countries ' decisions were based on the tip . France has since sent a letter of apology to the Bolivian government .\nMeanwhile , secret-spilling website WikiLeaks said that Snowden , who is still believed to be stuck in a Moscow airport 's transit area , had put in asylum applications to six new countries .\nThe organization said in a message posted to Twitter on Friday that it would n't be identifying the countries involved `` due to attempted U.S . interference . '' They also called for \u201c all strong countries \u201d in the Union of South American Nations to offer Snowden asylym .\nA number of countries have already rejected asylum applications from Snowden .", "Soon after he won the White House , President Obama declared to the world , \u201c The interests that we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart. \u201d It was a hopeful sentiment , one aimed at reversing a conflict-based way of thinking that had long pervaded American politics and foreign policy .\nYet an us-versus-them mentality seems to have been par for the course among US spy agencies , starting long before the Obama era . Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden allege that the NSA tapped the cellphones of as many as 35 world leaders , even German Chancellor Angela Merkel , a close ally .\nThe excuses for this high-level spying do not fit the normal \u201c everybody does it \u201d rationale among nations . Electronic snooping of an ally \u2019 s personal phone is particularly invasive and unnecessary . It hints at paranoia and pessimism run amuck , even in a post-9/11 threat environment . It harks back to the days of Watergate and McCarthyism .\nAs Mr. Obama now tries to restore trust in the United States , he must tell his security officials to be careful in not accepting the view that all people should be pigeonholed into a class or grouping , such as friend or foe . That can easily lead to an oversimplified , black-and-white mode of operation that creates enemies more imagined than real . And it certainly does not reflect Obama \u2019 s view that humans share more interests than the forces that drive them apart .\nHuman beings are too complex and varied to be stuffed into a label that is then considered determinative of how they will behave . Men are not always from Mars , for example , nor women from Venus . A person \u2019 s identity lies in individual qualities of thought , not an assemblage of perceptions about them in a mass grouping based on past behavior .\nSifting people into categories is a way to polarize them by \u201c the other \u201d and set everyone up for conflict . While much of written history assumes that change comes out of conflicts over differences \u2013 barbarian versus civilized , Christians versus Muslim , women versus men \u2013 the fact is that progress has been achieved more through cooperation than by contention .\n\u201c Human relations are ... about blending , borrowing , interacting , and interconnecting , \u201d says British historian David Cannadine . \u201c A divided past is in fact only part of the human story . It may be the one that makes the headlines , but , arguably , it \u2019 s not the only one and it \u2019 s probably not the most important one either . \u201d\nJournalists are particularly prone to typecast people by gender , social class , religion , nationality , or even race and ethnicity , a tendency made stronger as the news business struggles to retain audiences . Such an unexamined bias , for example , has led more TV news stations to compartmentalize themselves into liberal ( MSNBC ) and conservative ( Fox News ) , even though Americans tend to mix and match their political views .\nMost people prefer to affirm their individuality while discovering and building their common humanity . They don \u2019 t see the world as only a \u201c clash of civilizations \u201d or a Manichaean struggle between good and evil .\nLanguage by its very nature tends toward labels . That tendency , while helpful at times , can often mislead .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

A balanced view is needed by taking into account people \u2019 s commonalities as well as their contrasts .\n\u201c I note the obvious differences between each form and type , \u201d wrote poet Maya Angelou . \u201c But we are more alike , my friends , than we are unalike . \u201d", "The National Security Agency is the U.S. government 's primary eavesdropping agency . It intercepts , decodes , and analyzes foreign communications \u2014 such as emails , telephone calls , and other `` signals intelligence . '' The Fort Meade , Md.\u2013based agency , which has an annual budget of about $ 10 billion and employs some 40,000 people , has long carried out this mission in the shadows . But a series of leaks by former agency contractor Edward Snowden has revealed the stunning scale of its global surveillance operation . It 's now known that the NSA scoops up and stores billions of internet communications and cellphone records from the U.S. and around the world every day , which can then be studied by the agency 's legion of code breakers , data miners , and counterterrorism specialists . When President Obama receives his daily intelligence briefing , `` at least 75 percent '' comes from the NSA 's cyberspies , said Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush .\nIt was set up by President Truman in 1952 to consolidate the military 's jumble of code-breaking operations into a single , powerful agency capable of cracking the Soviet Union 's communications . The NSA , whose existence remained classified for decades , quickly became the intelligence community 's crown jewel . It ringed the USSR with 100-foot-tall , 1,000-foot-wide antennas that intercepted wireless signals as they bounced between the earth and the ionosphere . It stationed spy ships in the seas , and sent reconnaissance planes and satellites into the skies . Very quickly , the sheer volume of information harvested by the NSA dwarfed the `` human intelligence '' gathered by CIA agents in the field . `` The CIA is good at stealing a memo off a prime minister 's desk , '' said one former NSA director . `` They 're not much good at anything else . ''\nAt times , enormously so . The NSA was the first agency to spot Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962 . It provided advance warning of China 's first nuclear bomb test in 1964 , and its monitoring of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev 's limousine telephone gave American negotiators crucial inside information during arms limitation talks in 1972 . But NSA intercepts also led to some colossal blunders . In August 1964 , the agency reported that U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin had been attacked by North Vietnamese boats twice in three days . But the second attack , used by President Johnson to justify an escalation of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , never occurred . The NSA had overheard North Vietnamese radio operators discussing the first battle , and misinterpreted it as a live combat report . `` It was one of the greatest intelligence mistakes in history , '' said Matthew Aid , author of the NSA history The Secret Sentry .\nYes , though these efforts are sometimes of dubious legality . From the '50s to the early '70s , the NSA operated a program called `` Shamrock '' that saw U.S. telegram companies hand over up to 150,000 messages a month \u2014 including many telegrams from ordinary Americans \u2014 which agency analysts studied for evidence of Soviet spying . Under Presidents Johnson and Nixon , the NSA worked with the FBI and CIA to monitor the communications of civil rights leaders and anti-war protesters , including Martin Luther King Jr. and Jane Fonda , as well as members of Congress . The exposure of those programs by Idaho Sen. Frank Church led Congress to enact the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 , which created a secret court to hear warrant requests from intelligence services .\nThe attacks forced the NSA to adapt to the digital age . After Sept. 11 , 2001 , embarrassed the nation 's intelligence community , NSA officials launched a massive effort to capture , store , and analyze emails , texts , and online chats and videos used by terrorist networks . `` They took on a new mission that required sifting vast amounts of data to find a few important signals , '' said Stewart Baker , a former senior Homeland Security official . The NSA ordered America 's largest telecom firms and internet service providers to hand over raw data as it transited their networks . It tapped directly into the fiber-optic cables that constitute the internet 's nervous system , and recruited scores of Silicon Valley experts \u2014 including Max Kelly , Facebook 's former chief security officer \u2014 to help it navigate the new digital landscape .\nThe agency says it `` touches '' 1.6 percent of all traffic being carried on the internet \u2014 about 29.2 petabytes of communication data a day . That 's the equivalent of collecting all the text held in the Library of Congress 2,990 times every day . Intelligence officials argue that these intercepts have provided crucial insights into Iran 's nuclear weapons program , aided the U.S. military 's operations in Iraq and Libya , and helped disrupt dozens of potential terrorist attacks around the world . But some former employees claim the NSA 's ability to collect data is now outpacing its ability to analyze it . `` Despite all this collection , the NSA missed the Boston bombing , the underwear bomber , and the Times Square bomber , '' said James Bamford , a historian of the NSA . `` The problem is the bigger you build the haystack , the harder it is to find the needle . ''\nThe NSA has mastered the art of collecting vast amounts of communications data . It now has somewhere to store it . Last year , the agency opened a $ 1.7 billion data center in the Utah desert , which houses 100,000 square feet of high-performance servers . The computers use 65 megawatts of electricity \u2014 about the same as a small city \u2014 and generate so much heat that they require 1.5 million gallons of cooling water a day . William Binney , a former NSA technical director turned whistleblower , estimates that the warehouse 's servers can handle five zettabytes of data , which would fill 1.25 trillion DVDs . That means the agency has enough storage to hold `` 100 years ' worth of worldwide communications , [ phone records ] and emails , '' said Binney , `` and then have plenty of space left over to do any kind of parallel processing to try to break codes .

But the group was forced nonetheless to apologize on television and endure a trial in which they were convicted and each sentenced to 91 lashes . One was given a full year in prison while the others got six months , although their attorney told Iranwire.com the sentences were suspended .\n\u201c A suspended sentence becomes null and void after a certain period of time , \u201d attorney Farshid Rofugaran said . For the Happy Group , that period will be three years . \u201c When it \u2019 s a suspended sentence , the verdict is not carried out , but if during this period a similar offense is committed , then the accused is subject to legal punishment and the suspended sentence will then be carried out as well . \u201d\nThe video was part of a global campaign launched by pop star Pharrell Williams and was viewed by more than 100,000 people on YouTube . The six who appeared on the video and a man who shot the footage apologized and said they had been tricked into doing it .

He has accepted his charges , but throughout the trial , he stated that he wrote the material without thinking and in poor psychological condition , \u201d a source told the Campaign .", "Perhaps taking a page out of the president \u2019 s political handbook , Washington state \u2019 s Democratic governor has announced he is placing a moratorium on state executions . No one on death row will be executed during his tenure , he said today at a press conference ; but no one convicted of murder will be released or have their sentences commuted , either . The AP reports :\nGov . Jay Inslee said Tuesday he was suspending the use of the death penalty in Washington state , announcing a move that he hopes will enable officials to `` join a growing national conversation about capital punishment . '' The Democrat said he came to the decision after months of review , meetings with family members of victims , prosecutors and law enforcement . `` There have been too many doubts raised about capital punishment , there are too many flaws in this system today , '' Inslee said at a news conference . `` There is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system . '' Inslee said that the use of the death penalty is inconsistent and unequal . The governor 's staff briefed lawmakers about the move on Monday night and Tuesday morning . Inslee 's moratorium , which will be in place for as long as he is governor , means that if a death penalty case comes to his desk , he will issue a reprieve , which is n't a pardon and does n't commute the sentences of those condemned to death . `` During my term , we will not be executing people , '' said Inslee , who was elected in 2012 . `` Nobody is getting out of prison , period . ''\nOpposing capital punishment on principle is a perfectly legitimate position to take . But does the governor have the legal or judicial authority to unilaterally postpone a state execution ? It seems he does . In fact , one sweeping power vested in the state 's chief executive ( besides , of course , the ability to pardon an offender if he so chooses ) is issuing a \u201c reprieve , \u201d which would temporarily save a death row inmate from being executed , according to the Seattle Times :\nAccording to the state Attorney General \u2019 s website , \u201c Under RCW 10.01.120 , the Governor has the authority to commute a death sentence to life in prison at hard labor and , upon a petition from the offender , to pardon the offender . A commutation is generally defined as a lessening of the criminal penalty , whereas a pardon is often defined as the termination of the criminal penalty. \u201d The Attorney General \u2019 s Office also said that the governor \u201c has the power to issue a reprieve ( also called a stay of execution or a \u201c respite \u201d ) to temporarily delay the imposition of a death sentence . A reprieve is to be issued \u201c for good cause shown , and as the Governor thinks proper. \u201d \u201c Washington \u2019 s Constitution and state statutes grant the governor significant powers over the fate of individuals sentenced to death , \u201d Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday morning . \u201c Consequently , the governor has the authority to hit the \u2019 pause \u2019 button for executions in Washington . \u201d\nEighteen U.S. states have abolished the death penalty .

Sign up to receive it here .\nTwo months after \u2588\u2588\u2588 and The New York Times Magazine published a joint investigation that cast doubt on key testimony in a Florida death penalty case , the fate of James Dailey remains uncertain . Dailey was scheduled to be executed on Nov. 7 , 2019 , but he was granted a stay of execution last fall . That stay expired on Dec. 30 . Ever since , as Dailey \u2019 s attorneys have sought to have his claims of innocence evaluated in state and federal courts , one question has loomed over his case : What will Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis do ?\nDailey remains under an active death warrant \u2014 an order that authorizes his execution should the governor set a new date \u2014 in a cell that is just 30 feet from Florida \u2019 s execution chamber .\nDailey and his co-defendant , Jack Pearcy , were convicted of the 1985 murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio . Pearcy received a life sentence . Dailey , whose conviction rested largely on the testimony of con man-turned-jailhouse informant Paul Skalnik , was condemned to death .\nGet Email Updates Sign up to get more from Pamela Colloff about her investigation into jailhouse informants and how she reported the story .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588-Times Magazine investigation found that Skalnik was one of the most prolific , and most effective , jailhouse informants in American history . In the 1980s , he testified or supplied information in at least 37 cases in Pinellas County , Florida , alone . Florida prosecutors put Skalnik on the stand again and again , even though he was notoriously unreliable , and in exchange for his damning testimony , they granted him leniency . Just five days after Dailey was sentenced to death in 1987 , Skalnik was released from jail . Skalnik has always maintained that his testimony in Dailey \u2019 s trial was truthful and that he did not receive any benefits in return .\nDeSantis can set a new execution date until March 23 , when Dailey \u2019 s death warrant expires . After that , the governor would have to sign a new warrant before he could set an execution date .\nAcross Florida , newspaper editorial boards and columnists have cited the reporting by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and the Times Magazine on Skalnik in expressing their concern about Dailey \u2019 s possible execution . Tampa Bay Times columnist Daniel Ruth wrote that there would be \u201c blood on DeSantis \u2019 hands \u201d if he allowed Dailey to be put to death . The Orlando Sentinel warned : \u201c Gov . DeSantis Must Not Be Conned into Executing James Dailey. \u201d Miami Herald opinion columnist Carl Hiaasen cautioned that \u201c sending a man to his grave on the worthless word of Paul Skalnik wouldn \u2019 t be justice . It would be a shameful travesty . \u201d\n\u201c It seems clear that the state never had enough real evidence to convict Dailey , so it turned to lies \u2014 lies that have come undone , \u201d wrote The Daytona Beach News-Journal \u2019 s editorial board .\nDeSantis has indicated that he is waiting for the case to play out in the courts . But over the past several months , the courts have not looked favorably on Dailey \u2019 s attempts to have his case reconsidered . Dailey \u2019 s case highlights a strange fact of the criminal justice system : Because the standard for proving actual innocence is incredibly high , judges are often reluctant to overturn convictions even when evidence emerges that casts the original facts of the case into doubt or reveals once-incriminating testimony to be far more ambiguous .\nIn December , U.S. District Judge William F. Jung rejected a request from Dailey \u2019 s federal attorneys for an indefinite stay of execution so that they could pursue his innocence claims . \u201c A thorough review shows the state \u2019 s trial case against James Dailey was not strong , but it was sufficient , \u201d Jung wrote .\nAfter Jung \u2019 s decision , Dailey \u2019 s federal attorneys requested permission from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to file an additional federal habeas petition in which they asked that his claims of innocence be considered . But they were rebuffed in a ruling on Jan. 30 .\nRead More He \u2019 s a Liar , a Con Artist and a Snitch . His Testimony Could Soon Send a Man to His Death . Paul Skalnik has a decadeslong criminal record and may be one of the most prolific jailhouse informants in U.S. history . The state of Florida is planning to execute a man based largely on his word .\nIn a remarkable footnote to the ruling , Chief Judge Ed Carnes acknowledged that Skalnik \u2019 s testimony at Dailey \u2019 s trial was likely false . \u201c The layout of the jail where Dailey was housed and the procedures in place for prisoners in protective custody , like Skalnik , establish that Dailey could not have confessed to Skalnik in the way Skalnik said he did , \u201d Carnes wrote . \u201c And other evidence indicates Skalnik lied about other matters during the trial . \u201d\nBut neither Skalnik \u2019 s lies , nor other evidence Dailey \u2019 s lawyers presented to the 11th Circuit , ultimately mattered . \u201c Dailey \u2019 s new evidence , at most , casts some degree of doubt on some of the testimony the State presented at trial , \u201d Carnes wrote . \u201c But we are not jurors deciding in the first instance whether the State has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt . We are a court of appeals deciding more than 30 years after a murder whether the inmate who was convicted of it , and whose conviction has been upheld at every turn for three decades , has shown a reasonable likelihood of meeting the \u2018 extraordinarily high \u2019 burden of making a \u2018 truly persuasive demonstration \u2019 that he is actually innocent . Dailey has not done that . \u201d\nCarnes , a former Alabama assistant attorney general , has long been assailed as overzealous in his pursuit of the death penalty \u2014 even in cases tainted by racial discrimination that were decided by all-white juries . An Alabama legal journal dubbed him \u201c Mr . Death Penalty . \u201d\nDailey \u2019 s lead federal attorney , Carol Wright , condemned the ruling . \u201c The court today says that proof of innocence is not enough , \u201d she wrote in a statement to The Tampa Bay Times . \u201c The court today says even if the state \u2019 s theory of the conviction is disproved , if the court can imagine any scenario of guilt however implausible an innocent man can be executed . The system is broken . \u201d\nThough Dailey \u2019 s appeals have not made headway in the federal courts , his case is also currently before the 6th Judicial Circuit Court in Clearwater , Florida , and it is there , as the possibility of his execution looms , that his legal team is fighting to have the courts examine his claims of innocence .\nOne of the most compelling issues before the court is an extraordinary new admission from Pearcy . In December , in a meeting with one of Dailey \u2019 s attorneys , Pearcy signed an affidavit that stated : \u201c James Dailey had nothing to do with the murder of Shelly Boggio . I committed the crime alone . James Dailey was back at the house when I drove Shelly Boggio to the place where I ultimately killed her . \u201d\nPearcy has now repeatedly confessed to being solely responsible for the crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison and for which Dailey was sentenced to death .\nJames Dailey at Florida State Prison in November . ( Eli Durst , special to The New York Times Magazine )\nIn 2017 , he signed a sworn affidavit in which he asserted that Dailey was not present when Boggio was killed . But when he was called to the stand the following year to attest to this under oath , he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination . Over the years , Pearcy has given numerous different accounts of the crime \u2014 at times blaming Dailey and other times inculpating himself .\nOn Feb. 20 , Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa will consider whether to grant the defense \u2019 s request for an evidentiary hearing at which Pearcy could be called to testify . Another issue before the judge concerns what prosecutors knew about Skalnik \u2019 s criminal history when they called him to testify at Dailey \u2019 s trial .\nAs the \u2588\u2588\u2588-Times Magazine investigation revealed , Skalnik was arrested in 1982 and charged \u2014 but never prosecuted \u2014 with \u201c lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under 14 , \u201d after a 12-year-old girl said he assaulted her . The state attorney \u2019 s office ultimately dropped the charge against him and continued to use him as a jailhouse informant . Once the charge was dropped , Skalnik was able to portray himself to jurors as a far more innocuous figure than he actually was .\nThis was true at Dailey \u2019 s trial , as well . When Skalnik was cross-examined in that trial , one of Dailey \u2019 s attorneys pressed him about his criminal history , asking , \u201c How bad were your charges ? \u201d\nSkalnik was quick to reply : \u201c They were grand theft , counselor , not murder , not rape , no physical violence in my life. \u201d He never mentioned his arrest for the molestation charge .\nProsecutors did not object to this characterization . In fact , they doubled down on the idea that Skalnik was morally superior to the man who sat at the defense table . \u201c There is a hierarchy over in that jail , just like in life , \u201d prosecutor Beverly Andrews said in closing arguments , drawing a distinction between Skalnik \u2019 s theft charges and the murder charge that Dailey faced . \u201c Some crimes , \u201d she added , \u201c are worse than others . \u201d\nDid the prosecutors who tried Dailey \u2014 Andrews and Robert Heyman \u2014 know about Skalnik \u2019 s molestation charge , but not disclose it to jurors ? Both have strenuously denied any wrongdoing .\nLast month , Dailey \u2019 s attorneys filed a motion with the 6th Judicial Circuit Court alleging that Heyman \u201c was aware of the sexual assault charges previously faced by Skalnik and dismissed by his office. \u201d They pointed to handwritten notes the state attorney \u2019 s office turned over in a separate capital case in which Skalnik testified . The notes appeared to be from Dailey \u2019 s trial and referenced the testimony of a Pinellas County sheriff \u2019 s detective , John Halliday , about Skalnik . Next to Skalnik \u2019 s name , the words \u201c sex assault \u201d had been crossed out .\nA reproduction of notes James Dailey \u2019 s lawyers submitted as part of a January court filing .\nDailey \u2019 s attorneys had suspected that the notes belonged to Heyman , who questioned the detective during Dailey \u2019 s trial . According to the motion they filed , Heyman said the notes were his in a January interview with ABC News that has not yet aired .\n\u201c Mr . Heyman was apparently prepared to ask Halliday about Skalnik \u2019 s prior sexual assault charge , but , after Skalnik \u2019 s false testimony regarding his criminal history , Mr. Heyman did not , \u201d Dailey \u2019 s attorneys assert in the motion . \u201c The State permitted Skalnik \u2019 s false testimony about his criminal history to stand uncorrected. \u201d ( The state has not filed a response thus far . )\nDailey \u2019 s attorneys have previously argued that jurors could not fairly assess Skalnik \u2019 s credibility as a witness without knowing his full criminal history . Heyman \u2019 s admission allowed them to make a powerful new argument : that the prosecution not only knew Skalnik had misrepresented his history , but then let that mischaracterization stand and bolstered his testimony with representations that he was merely a thief . In doing so , Dailey \u2019 s attorneys allege , Heyman \u201c perpetrated a fraud on the court. \u201d In light of that , they argue , the 6th Judicial Circuit Court should vacate Dailey \u2019 s conviction and death sentence .\nIf Siracusa grants the defense \u2019 s request for an evidentiary hearing , Heyman could be called to testify .\nDailey \u2019 s attorneys have also filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court , asking its justices to review the Florida Supreme Court \u2019 s refusal to consider Pearcy \u2019 s 2017 sworn affidavit . An unlikely coalition of groups has filed amicus curiae briefs . These \u201c friend of the court \u201d filings \u2014 submitted by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , eight former and current prosecutors and Conservatives Concerned About The Death Penalty \u2014 ask the nation \u2019 s highest court to review Dailey \u2019 s case .\n\u201c Generally , the weaker the prosecution \u2019 s case , the stronger the likelihood that prosecutors will resort to using jailhouse informant testimony , \u201d the prosecutors wrote . \u201c Because informant testimony is inherently unreliable , prosecutors have an obligation to present an accurate and complete picture of the benefits received so that jurors can consider in context the credibility to which the testimony is entitled . The evidence unveiled after Mr. Dailey \u2019 s trial about the jailhouse informants and their motives to testify stands in stark contrast to that presented during trial , thus undermining any confidence in the jury \u2019 s verdict . \u201d\nAs the courts sort out what will happen next , Dailey remains on \u201c death watch , \u201d steps away from the execution chamber .", "Several thousand prisoners in California may be eligible to apply for sentence reductions , after voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative Tuesday that alters the state 's controversial three-strikes law .\nBut voters also rejected a proposition that would abolish the death penalty in the state . Proposition 34 would have replaced capital punishment with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole .\n`` I guess the next step , then , is to start executing these monsters that exist on death row , '' says Mark Klass , the father of Polly Klass , a 12-year-old girl who was brutally kidnapped , raped and murdered in 1993 .\nKlass says he 's relieved that the man convicted of the crime will remain on death row . `` They understand that for that worst 2 percent of murders \u2014 those individuals who kill little children , who kill police officers , who are serial killers , who are mass murderers , who are psychopathic and show absolutely no remorse \u2014 those are the individuals that we can do without , '' Klass says .\nMore than 700 inmates are currently on California 's death row , and 14 of them have now exhausted all of their legal appeals . It 's still unclear , however , when executions would resume in California .\nFormer Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti had joined with the ACLU and a former head warden of San Quentin prison to try to abolish the state 's death penalty . He says both sides agree that the death penalty does not serve as a crime deterrent .\nGarcetti argues that the state has spent $ 4 billion to house death row inmates and pay for their appeals . And though capital punishment still stands , Garcetti says Tuesday 's vote nevertheless shows that Californians increasingly oppose the death penalty .\n`` Look at how many voters in 1978 passed the death penalty law that 's in effect today . That 's 71 percent . Now we 're down to 53 percent in favor of the death penalty , '' Garcetti says . `` They 'll come over , so it 's a matter of time , that 's what it is . ''\nWhile Californians rejected Proposition 34 , they did vote to change the state 's three-strikes law . The revision eliminates the mandatory 25 years-to-life sentence for a third felony , if that crime is nonviolent .\nAs many as 3,000 prisoners could appeal their original sentences in the wake of the vote , which worries Mike Reynolds , the author of the original three-strikes law , adopted in 1994 .\n`` It 's going to destroy the deterrent value of the three-strikes law , '' Reynolds says . `` This is going to bring a lot more bloodshed and a lot more costs to our state in terms of crime and dealing with it . ''\nBut Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley says those fears are unfounded . `` Hordes of people are not going to be released , '' he says . `` Not under this very modest proposal . ''\nCooley says repeat offenders will still have to serve time , but their sentences now will be proportionate to the crime committed . He says that 's a practice L.A. County has already been following successfully for the past 12 years .\n`` Our crime rate 's at a 60-year low here in Los Angeles County , '' Cooley says . `` We 're not clogging our courts with trials of relatively minor , nonserious , nonviolent felonies , and we 're assuring proportionate sentencing based upon the nature of the new offense . ''\n`` Legally speaking , it 's a modest change in the three-strikes law , but politically speaking , it 's a monster change , '' says Adam Gelb , director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Center on the States .\nGelb says until now , California has had the nation 's harshest three-strikes law . He says the vote to revise it confirms that people are tired of spending money on nonviolent offenders serving long prison sentences .\n`` California helped start this three-strikes trend many years ago , '' Gelb says . `` And this vote to scale it back is going to resonate across the country for years to come . ''\nGelb says this could mean other states will begin to reform their three-strikes laws , too .", "Want the best of \u2588\u2588\u2588 News straight to your inbox ?

The chat was the tip of the iceberg . \u201d\nThe crowd surged along the Americas Expressway despite the punishing heat \u2014 toddlers , teenagers , professionals and the elderly , all dripping in sweat and smiling as they waved Puerto Rico flags large and small and hoisted signs .\n\u201c This is to show that the people respect themselves , \u201d said Ana Carrasquillo , 26 . \u201c We \u2019 ve put up with corruption for so many years . \u201d\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News , Rossell\u00f3 said that he will not resign and that he is focused on tackling corruption and helping the island recover from Maria .\n\u201c I \u2019 m making amends , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve apologized for all the comments that I made on the chat . \u201d\nOn Sunday evening , Rossell\u00f3 , a Democrat , sought to calm the unrest by promising not to seek re-election in 2020 or continue as head of his pro-statehood New Progressive Party .

''\nStephanie Cutter , Obama 's deputy campaign manager , originally made the claim Thursday on a conference call .\n`` Either Mitt Romney , through his own words and his own signature was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC , which is a felony , or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments , '' Cutter said , responding to a newspaper report that Romney was listed as Bain Capital 's CEO after 1999 , when he has repeatedly said he left the private equity firm .\nThe significance of Romney 's date of departure centers on companies acquired by Bain that later shipped jobs overseas . Romney claims he left the company before those decisions were made , but Democrats point to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that indicate Romney was still listed as the firm 's CEO .\nCutter 's words drew a quick response from Obama 's opponents , who said the suggestion that the presumptive GOP nominee had committed a felony was below the office of the presidency .\nRomney himself said in an interview with CNN on Friday that the charge was `` disgusting '' and `` demeaning , '' and called on Obama and his campaign to apologize .\nEd Gillespie , a senior adviser to Romney , echoed that sentiment on Sunday , saying on CNN the charges reflected a `` say anything '' stance adopted by the president 's campaign .\n`` We now know that this president will say anything to keep this highest office in the land , even if it means demeaning the highest office in the land , '' Gillespie said .\nAnd Kevin Madden , newly appointed to a more senior role on Romney 's team , said on CBS that the felony suggestion was out of line .\n`` I think it is very troubling that the president would direct this campaign to label someone like Gov . Romney , who is a very good and honorable man , as a felon . That 's very troubling , '' Madden said .\nCutter , sitting next to Madden on the CBS set , said she was not calling Romney a felon , but merely stating the Bain documents , if misrepresentative of his role at the company , would amount to a felony . She refused to apologize for the remark .\n`` He 's not going to get an apology , '' Cutter said . `` Just a few months ago in the primary Mitt Romney said to his opponents - who were crushing him at the time \u2013 'stop whining . ' And that 's a good message for the Romney campaign . Instead of whining about what the Obama campaign is saying , just put the facts out there and let people decide rather than trying to hide them . ''\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel , who left his post as Obama 's chief of staff in 2010 to run in the mayoral election , had similar advice for the Republican candidate .\n`` Give it up about Stephanie . Do n't worry about that , '' Emanuel said on ABC . `` What are you going to do when a China president says something about you ? Stop whining .

''", "CHARLOTTE , NC - Round two of the 2012 DNC is finally complete , following an interminable stemwinder from former President Bill Clinton . A few thoughts on the evening : Prior to the 10pm ET hour , the convention lineup was wholly unremarkable . Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer both spoke for the second time this week . Why ? These speeches lasted nearly six-and-a-half hours in total . Were retreads necessary ? In any case , we heard from more abortion proponents , several union bosses , and a long list of unremarkable politicians . It was tedious in the extreme , especially the mindless Bain demagoguery . On to my `` prime '' prime-time grades :\nSandra Fluke : D. The thirtysomething recent law grad gave a surly and self-pitying speech about birth control and abortion . This is a young woman whose claim to fame is demanding that the Catholic school she chose to attend be coerced by the federal government to cast aside their beliefs and pay for her `` free '' birth control . She cast herself as a courageous victim , repeatedly knocking Mitt Romney for refusing to stand up for her after Rush Limbaugh called her a name . Absolutely pitiful . Her demagoguery about women `` dying '' under the Romney/Ryan plan was unseemly , crass , and befitting her pathetic 15 minutes of fame . Sandra Fluke may be a hero to some liberals , but I ca n't imagine she has even an ounce of appeal to most average people . Democratic commentator Kirsten Powers was decidedly unimpressed with Fluke 's whole schtick .\nJim Sinegal : N/A . The former CEO of Costco 's job was to convince people that Democrats are good for business . His speech was dull and so unmemorable that I have no meaningful analysis to offer .\nElizabeth Warren : C. The Harvard Law professor led the class warfare fight tonight , as is her wont . We do everything `` together , '' the system 's `` rigged , '' etc . She called ( surprise ! ) for much higher levels of government `` investment '' in practically all imaginable sectors . As the author of the original `` you did n't build that '' riff , her message was characteristic and reprehensible . Her delivery was slightly improved and she remembered to smile -- so marks for that , I guess . Interestingly , Warren did n't mention her `` heritage . '' Weird , right ?\nBill Clinton : B+ . It was good . It should have been shorter . If it had , it would have been significantly better . The former president spoke for 48 minutes ; he was reportedly allotted 20-25 minutes . Clinton made the best case available to Obama backers , basically : Things were really bad , he inherited an impossible problem , he 's done as well as anyone possibly could have , things are starting to get better , he 's a good guy , and he needs more time . This argument rests on the hope that voters will believe that they 're better off under Obama and that his policies have not been counter-productive . Tough sledding , but Clinton 's a word wizard . He spun a compelling yarn . He took a risk , though , by ignoring his own pollsters ' advice by crossing into Obama economy happy talk a little too often . Clinton also engaged in a lot of Republican blaming , slightly leavened by a few kind words about his Republican predecessor and successor . He repeated the `` GOP obstructionism '' trope without any acknowledgement of Democrats ' massive majorities for two full years , nor any recognition that the American people elected Republicans in a landslide in 2010 explicitly to slam the brakes on the Obama agenda . After moving through the ( effective ) heart of his remarks , Clinton decided to play fact-checker-in-chief . This is where he wandered . He addressed a litany of Republican arguments and policies , erecting and destroying straw men along the way . His `` arithmetic , '' as he called it , was tendentious and incomplete . Indeed , he repeated many of the claims FactCheck.org dealt with this morning . He talked , and talked , and talked -- on the economy , on healthcare , on Medicare , on the debt , and on welfare reform ( speaking of which , read this and this ) . His mind is still sharp and his political instincts are still keen , but Clinton strayed from the script too often and overstayed his welcome . Not in this hall , of course . The partisan crowd lapped up every last word . But at home . If his address had been shaved down to 30 or even 35 minutes , it would have been dynamite . It was still quite good . The guy loves to talk , and he 's pretty fun to listen to . In the end , Bill Clinton made the most effective sales pitch for `` four more years '' we 've heard at this convention . Did people stick it out through he whole marathon , or were they watching football ? The image of the night was Obama striding on stage to hug Clinton as the pair basked in the crowd 's adulation . Obama wants voters to almost imagine Clinton as his running mate , thus appropriating the 42nd president 's record and enduring good will . Obama 's counting on Clinton 's decade-old legacy to save him from his own .\nOdds and Ends : The media is eager to move past today 's floor debacle , so they 'll pump a `` back on track , thanks to a masterful Clinton performance ! '' narrative . Clinton salvaged a lackluster 10pm hour ( and session , really ) then dragged it well into the next . Clinton 's star power and strong endorsement certainly helped Obama ; the rest of the night , not so much .", "Mr. Sousa said the group had compiled a fund-raising list of more than a million potential donors \u2019 email addresses , which it is renting to the Carson campaign .

The cops wisely declined to offer an estimate of the size of the crowd , but it was bigger than anyone else has drawn so far . Who but the Donald , who compared it to a crowd at a Billy Graham revival meeting , would risk holding a political rally in a football stadium in Alabama , exposing empty seats and inviting unwanted comparisons .\nPresident Obama himself threw a big flat rock in the Democratic pond on Monday with a resounding splash . He sent his press agent out to suggest to reporters that he might endorse someone in the Democratic primaries , and it didn \u2019 t sound like he was talking about Hillary . The president , said press secretary Josh Earnest , thinks taking Joe Biden on his ticket seven years ago was the smartest political decision he ever made .

In the general election , his endorsement might be a sloppy kiss of death , where voters of all kinds could rush to make the judgment that is likely to be the verdict of history \u2014 Mr. Obama was a freak of history , elected by a well-meaning but naive electorate eager to show good faith and hope for the best .\nTaking a flier is rarely a substitute for making a sound judgment . Nominating a candidate with little political experience can be tempting .

( Denis Balibouse/Reuters )\nSince its inception 72 years ago almost to the day , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has been credited with the eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of other devastating illnesses , including leprosy and river blindness .\nThis record of success makes the current corruption of the organization all the more shameful .\nOn December 30 , Chinese doctor Li Wenliang warned colleagues about the outbreak of an illness resembling severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , which sparked a pandemic in 2003 . Public-health officials rely on the acuity of doctors like Li , whose early warnings prevent the spread of deadly diseases . But Chinese authorities didn \u2019 t reward Li ; they summoned him to the Public Security Bureau in Wuhan on accusations that he had made false statements and disrupted the public order .\nThe Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) followed up with numerous other arrests , and publicly warned that it would punish anyone spreading \u201c rumors \u201d on social media .

Alas , he was never able to voice his objections : He died after contracting COVID-19 .\nWhen the WHO emergency committee discussed whether to declare COVID-19 a public-health emergency on January 23 , international observers had definitively discredited Chinese health data . Yet Tedros relied on those data in arguing against declaring an emergency \u2014 over the objections of other committee members . That decision delayed the mobilization of public-health resources around the world . John Mackenzie , a committee member , attributed the delay to \u201c very poor reporting \u201d and \u201c very poor communication \u201d from the CCP . After finally declaring an emergency on January 30 , Tedros continued to lavish praise on China .

They backed Tedros \u2019 s bid to run the WHO in 2017 , seeking to plant an ally in the U.N. leadership . Who was better suited for the role than a leftist political operative with a history of covering up health emergencies ? As one of his first actions at the helm , Tedros assured the Chinese that he would adhere to the \u201c One China \u201d policy , barring Taiwanese participation .

Just as they created checks and balances at the national level among the legislative , executive and judicial branches , they also wanted checks and balances between the central government and the states . Over time , the federal government has regularly usurped the broad authority given to the states , often to wipe away problems or correct historical injustices .\nThis spring , the balance of power has been flipped , with states forced to compensate for failings at the national level . Those federal deficiencies reflect an absence of readiness and sometimes a lack of interest and competence on the part of the Trump administration .

As the United States matured , the powers of states were steadily chipped away by Congress and the Supreme Court . ( Matt McClain/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nThe word \u201c federalism \u201d does not appear in the Constitution , but it was always meant to be an essential component of the new American government established in the late 18th century .\n\u201c Federalism is the great constitutional compromise , \u201d said Abbe Gluck , a professor at Yale Law School . \u201c It \u2019 s the way that 13 different small republics came together to form a nation . They were skeptical of federal power , so they formed a union with layers , with a lot of authority reserved to the states . \u201d\n\u201c In its purest form , federalism is a power-sharing arrangement , \u201d Michael Leavitt , a former Republican governor of Utah and secretary of health and human services in the administration of President George W. Bush , said in an email .\n\u201c Today , federalism means , at a minimum , viewing both the states and the federal government as legitimate sources of legal and political authority , but little consensus exists as to what that general principle of multiplicity should mean in practice , \u201d Alison LaCroix , a professor at the University of Chicago Law School , wrote in an essay published in the Yale Law Journal in 2014 .\nIn ratifying the Constitution , Leavitt said , states agreed to a division of labor in which the national government would have responsibility for roughly two dozen enumerated duties . All other powers were reserved to the states through the 10th Amendment . This was to result in a \u201c limited , but supreme , national government \u201d with the states and the federal government there to protect their own powers and prevent either entity from becoming too powerful .\nFederalism allows states the freedom to devise solutions that fit their economic , demographic , cultural and geographical realities \u2014 as well as offering the country multiple styles of leadership beyond the presidency . Which is why Justice Louis Brandeis coined the description of the states as \u201c laboratories of democracy . \u201d\n\u201c The downside [ of federalism ] , \u201d Gluck said , \u201c is that it can breed enormous inequality across the country . The South \u2019 s history of racism is the most obvious example . \u201d\nGluck said those inequities have continued down to the present , being most notable in the decision by a group of more than a dozen mostly Republican-led states not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , denying access to health-care coverage to many low-income families .\nZach Stafford adjusts the TV volume at home in Belleville , Ill. , on April 28 as he and his mother , Debra Mize , watch the daily coronavirus briefing by Illinois Gov . J.B. Pritzker ( D ) . ( Jeff Roberson/AP )\nThe disparate responses to the coronavirus have focused attention on this reality . \u201c The states have drifted into different camps where the nature of their role in the federal system has increasingly differed and the nature of the government we get depends on where we live , \u201d said Donald F. Kettl , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \u201c The Divided States of America : Why Federalism Doesn \u2019 t Work . \u201d\nGary Gerstle , a professor of history at Cambridge University in England and author of \u201c Liberty and Coercion : The Paradox of American Government , \u201d noted that states started out with broad powers to regulate virtually all activity within their borders .\nStates exercised their authority through what is known as police power \u2014 though not to be confused with a definition that focuses only on law and order . Instead , this concept of police power derives from English doctrine and practice . This gave states responsibilities over health , safety , welfare and morals within their boundaries , everything from the regulation of businesses to Sunday blue laws to dealing with disasters and epidemics .\n\u201c The police power endows the states with an extraordinary authority to act on almost any issue having to do with the people \u2019 s welfare for the good of the commonwealth , \u201d Gerstle said . \u201c If that means overriding individual choice and individual rights , so be it . \u201d\nAs the nation matured , state powers were steadily chipped away by Congress and the Supreme Court . The vehicle used most frequently by the high court to give Washington ever-greater power was the Constitution \u2019 s commerce clause \u2014 which grants the federal government power to regulate commerce among the states .\nTimes of crisis often enhanced federal power . President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2019 s response to the Great Depression resulted in the creation of the modern and more powerful national government . \u201c The 20th century is the story of the New Deal and the 1930s reshaping everything about federalism , \u201d LaCroix said in a recent interview . \u201c The expansion of the federal commerce power keeps continuing . The scope keeps growing . \u201d\nThe civil rights movement of the 1960s proved to be another watershed moment in giving the federal government greater power over the states . The 1964 Civil Rights Act was the cornerstone of the shift , and when the high court ruled unanimously that the act was constitutional , the justices used the commerce clause , rather than the 14th Amendment , to uphold it .\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw some shift back , as the Rehnquist court sought to prevent continuing erosion . But those changes still left the federal government with significantly more power . \u201c It turned out to be a lopsided game , \u201d Leavitt said of the long struggle between Washington and the states . \u201c States have often been politically anemic in defense of their role . \u201d\nAt the April 19 daily briefing by the coronavirus task force , Trump shows video of New York Gov .

But governors learned this spring that the existing relationship was inadequate to meet the moment . Because of hesitation by the president , they had to act on their own , and those unilateral decisions put them in the spotlight as well as the hot seat .\nOhio \u2019 s Mike DeWine ( R ) was the first governor in the nation to close schools . Even earlier , before there were any confirmed cases of covid-19 in his state , he prohibited spectator attendance at a popular annual bodybuilding festival .\nDisregarding a court decision that went against him , DeWine controversially postponed the state \u2019 s presidential primary on the eve of voting . He had hoped the courts would order the primary delayed , but his strategy of employing a friendly lawsuit to bring about the desired judicial ruling backfired .\n\u201c We pulled a judge who didn \u2019 t agree , \u201d DeWine said . \u201c It \u2019 s the luck of the draw . So at that point , I instructed my health director to issue a health order and that \u2019 s what she did . . . .

Within a 24-hour period , the actions of those three governors put roughly 70 million Americans under orders to stay at home , with only a few exceptions .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201c was issuing guidance , but there was no leadership from Washington , \u201d Pritzker said . \u201c Is it hard to do ? Sure . But it \u2019 s part of the job . That \u2019 s what leadership is . Leadership is stepping out front and showing people the direction they need to go that they don \u2019 t necessarily understand or agree with . \u201d\nCuomo saw his state become the center of the pandemic , with more than 316,000 cases and more than 24,000 deaths . His daily news conferences became must-watch television , with a governor never known for his likability projecting empathy and realism while repeatedly challenging Washington to do more .\nThe briefings provided a contrast with Trump \u2019 s often-contentious daily sessions in the White House . Responding to Cuomo , Trump argued that New York did not need all it was asking for and that the federal government supplied New York with everything it did need and more .\nMaryland Gov .

( Salwan Georges/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nAs chairman of the National Governors Association , Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) has had to delicately navigate the relationship between the White House and his state , and the relationship between Washington and the governors collectively .\nIn his public comments about the relationship , Hogan has chosen his words diplomatically but has not hesitated to chart his own course . He shut down his state early \u2014 closing schools almost at the same time as Ohio did \u2014 and has made clear his differences with the president when he judged that events required doing so .\n\u201c The crisis demanded leadership and demanded action , \u201d he said . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t a time to debate federalism and philosophy , arguing about what powers should rest with the federal government or the state or Congress .\nTrump berated governors who criticized him . Governors learned that showing gratitude and praising the president were the price for federal cooperation and aid . Trump was particularly nasty toward Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer ( D ) when she expressed frustration with Washington . He tweeted that Whitmer was \u201c in way over her head , she doesn \u2019 t have a clue . \u201d\nWashington Gov . Jay Inslee ( D ) found himself as the first governor on the front lines when the virus began to savage a nursing home in the Seattle area . In pointed language , he begged for help from Washington . Trump called him \u201c a snake \u201d and suggested that Vice President Pence , a former governor of Indiana who chairs the White House coronavirus task force , stop dealing with Inslee .\n\u201c I hope this makes it into the story , \u201d Inslee said . \u201c The vice president has been continually helpful to us . He talks to us regularly . He has tried to ameliorate some of these problems . He has tried to remove some of the organizational underbrush . We have appreciated his efforts on this . \u201d\nWhy was the relationship so bumpy ? \u201c Well , to be gracious , part of it is the fog of war , \u201d Inslee said . \u201c It \u2019 s people having to do 50 things in five minutes . . . .

But he acknowledged that there have been \u201c rough patches \u201d where things \u201c went off the rails. \u201d He attributed that to mixed messaging from the White House and to the extraordinary nature of the pandemic .\n\u201c There is tension between what the role of the federal government should be and what are the roles of the states , \u201d he added . \u201c It \u2019 s an unprecedented crisis that no one has ever faced before . . . . The federal government was not prepared . States were not prepared . Hospitals were not prepared . Manufacturers were not prepared . \u201d\nTrump has lacked consistency in describing the federal government \u2019 s responsibilities . When governors were pleading for medical equipment and supplies weeks ago , Trump encouraged them to act on their own . \u201c The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping , \u201d he said . \u201c You know , we \u2019 re not a shipping clerk . \u201d\nJeh Johnson , the secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama , said Trump had it backward . \u201c He says he \u2019 s not a shipping clerk . Well , actually , he \u2019 s the shipping clerk in chief , \u201d Johnson said .\nThe lack of preparedness and organization in Washington prompted governors to fend for themselves . Hogan , with the help of his Korean American wife Yumi Hogan , recently acquired 500,000 coronavirus test kits from South Korea . Massachusetts Gov .

In March , as complaints about the federal government \u2019 s response mounted , Trump said , \u201c I don \u2019 t take any responsibility at all. \u201d He blamed others , including the Obama administration , for some of the shortages of tests and equipment .\nMore recently , the president claimed , with no basis in fact , that his \u201c authority is total \u201d to deal with the crisis , particularly on the timing for lifting state-ordered restrictions . The next day he backed down , acknowledging to governors in a conference call that the authority to make the decisions was theirs .\nTo Trump \u2019 s critics , that reversal was seen as another effort on his part to avoid responsibility , should things go wrong . \u201c His idea of federalism is when it \u2019 s all going well , it \u2019 s us . When [ it ] hits the fan , it \u2019 s you , \u201d said Michael Nutter , a former Democratic mayor of Philadelphia .\nTesting remains a point of contention . Governors have contradicted the White House repeatedly on the availability of tests , which will be needed in huge numbers as businesses begin to reopen and people leave their homes . \u201c It was a terrible crisis , \u201d Hogan said of the shortage of tests . \u201c It \u2019 s now better . But it \u2019 s not even close to where it needs to be . \u201d\nGovernors have begun to work together through their joint conference calls and by forming regional alliances to coordinate when to lift restrictions . They have sought to project a united front when dealing with the administration . But the debate over the reopening of the economy has created divisions among them .\nGeorgia Gov .

Trump , in another whiplash moment , said last week that he took issue with the governor \u2019 s plan . \u201c I told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision , but he has to do what he thinks is right , \u201d Trump said .\nGovernors have been making hard decisions for weeks , but equally difficult ones lie ahead . Up to now , governors who ordered the most stringent restrictions on their populations won praise and earned higher approval ratings . But the debate over reopening economies has put the trade-offs involved in those decisions at the forefront of a growing debate .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the old saying that war \u2019 s too important to be left to the generals , \u201d said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. , a former governor of Indiana and now president of Purdue University . \u201c Everyone is using the war analogy for this . Then it \u2019 s too important to be left entirely to the epidemiologists . . . . The trade-off problem is front and center .

( Matt McClain/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nState leaders have exercised their powers often to the fullest , but those powers still are limited . That has focused more attention on , and prompted considerable criticism of , the failure of the administration to exercise the federal government \u2019 s full powers .\nTrump has complained that the federal stockpiles he inherited were inadequate to meet the pandemic \u2019 s demands . But Lisa Monaco , White House homeland security adviser under Obama , said those stockpiles were meant only to be a bridge . \u201c It was always envisioned that [ during a pandemic ] , the federal government would step in and activate the supply chain and manufacturing , \u201d she said .\nOnly the federal government can use its convening authority and the Defense Production Act to set priorities and make a market for needed resources \u2014 and at a scale and a speed that a crisis demands . As Texas law professor Chesney explained , the federal government can compel industries to act in ways no state can do .\n\u201c [ The president ] can say the United States is purchaser number one , \u201d Chesney said . \u201c Let \u2019 s say the net amount of need is 100 masks .

States have formed regional groups , and some governors say that they are more likely to take steps to prepare and protect their states against a future pandemic , rather than just counting on Washington to be ready .\nJanet Napolitano , a former governor of Arizona and secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration , said the relationship between Washington and the states in times of crisis should be like a smoothly running automobile . \u201c The four wheels of a car need to spin in the same direction at the same time , \u201d she said , something no one thinks has been the case in this battle .\nDaniels said the pandemic has shown the vibrancy of federalism but nonetheless could end as another crisis that enlarges the federal government . \u201c This [ virus ] thing does not manifest itself in the same way everywhere , and that \u2019 s an argument for a strong federal system and federal assistance that doesn \u2019 t try to proscribe every detail and constrain local responsiveness , \u201d he said .\n\u201c On the other side , \u201d he added , \u201c as people have been observing , wars have tended to centralize power and lead to bigger central government that never quite goes back to the size it was . \u201d\nHogan said this was no time for second-guessing the decisions that have been and are being made . In the meantime , he said , one thing seems clear : \u201c In the biggest crisis of our lifetimes , governors were on the front lines and taking charge .

Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) face a possible furlough of at least 30 days .\nNearly three-quarters of the USCIS workforce will be affected by the possible furlough , and notices will reportedly be handed out to USCIS employees between Wednesday and July 3 , The Washington Post reported . The furlough itself is expected to go into effect August 3 .\nUSCIS , which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security , has seen a reduction in operations due to the coronavirus pandemic , as visa and citizenship services have declined sharply . The Trump administration temporarily halted green card applications in April , and cross-border travel is at an all-time low .\nFees , which make up 97 % of the agency \u2019 s revenue , are projected to fall 60 % through the remainder of the fiscal year , according to Fox News . The agency also told Congress in May that it required a one-time emergency request for funding in order to continue operations normally .\n\u201c Without congressional intervention , USCIS will need to administratively furlough approximately 13,400 employees , \u201d a USCIS representative told The Washington Post in an email . ( RELATED : Immigration Offices Closed To The Public , Interviews Canceled Amid Coronavirus Pandemic )\nUSCIS requested an allocation of $ 1.2 billion in congressional funding over two years , and pledged to repay the funds to the U.S. Treasury Departments , CBS News reported . The agency \u2019 s proposal , however , would also require an additional 10 % surcharge on immigration petitions .\nWithout the appropriate financial support , the potential USCIS furloughs could be as widespread as the federal workforce furloughs that took place in 2013 , when sequestration budget limits forced federal agencies to cut pay from employees .\n\u201c With a loss of nearly three-fourths of its workforce , work , student and visitor visa petitions , asylum and citizenship/naturalization applications , green cards , and refugee applications will not be processed , \u201d AFGE President Everett Kelly told the House Homeland Security Committee last week at a hearing .", "( CNN ) - Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates set off shock waves in Washington with accounts from his upcoming memoir , in which he unleashes blistering criticism of Congress and his former colleagues in the Obama administration .\nHe also claims the President lost faith in his own Afghanistan policy .\nGates ' comments come in his memoir `` Duty : Memoirs of a Secretary at War , '' which was obtained by CNN but set to be released next week .\nIn the book , Gates writes , `` [ Obama ] eventually lost faith in the troop increase he ordered in Afghanistan , his doubts fed by top White House civilian advisers opposed to the strategy , who continually brought him negative news reports suggesting it was failing . ''\nA Republican appointee of President George W. Bush who stayed on into Obama 's administration , Gates also writes of a pivotal 2011 meeting in which Obama questions the abilities of Gen. David H. Petraeus .\n`` As I sat there , I thought : The president does n't trust his commander , ca n't stand Karzai , does n't believe in his own strategy and does n't consider the war to be his ... For him , it 's all about getting out , '' Gates writes .\nA source familiar with White House thinking on how to respond to Gates ' memoir told CNN that White House officials have been in meetings on the issue and were reaching out to allies to defend the President against the claims .\nThe source said they are being careful not to attack Gates directly , thinking that will backfire .\nOfficials believe Obama 's foreign policy legacy is strong because of his Afghanistan policies and the killing of Osama bin Laden , and that Gates ' accusations do n't hurt with the Democratic base .\nA White House official called attention to two parts of the book that reflect positively on the President . Gates said of Obama 's chief Afghanistan policies , `` I believe Obama was right in each of these decisions . ''\n`` I never doubted Obama 's support for the troops , '' Gates writes . The official , however , did not highlight the rest of the sentence , which says `` only his support for their mission . ''\nA former White House official contested the excerpts saying , `` I thought the President was a close ally of Gates . It 's disappointing , because if Gates had issues you would 've expected him to raise them . When I spoke to Gates about the president he was always effusive . ''\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the President `` deeply appreciates Gates ' service '' and is open to differing points of view from his national security team .\n`` Deliberations over our policy on Afghanistan have been widely reported on over the years , and it is well known that the President has been committed to achieving the mission of disrupting , dismantling and defeating al Qaeda , while also ensuring that we have a clear plan for winding down the war , which will end this year , '' Hayden said in response to the comments .\nA senior U.S. military official involved in some of the events described in the book expressed dismay with Gates , telling CNN that if Gates had been in uniform and felt that the President and his staff were deficient , he would have had an obligation to resign . He noted some may feel Gates also had the same obligation given that he signed orders sending troops off to war .\nThis official was directly involved in Afghanistan troop surge discussions . He was adamant the military commanders did not `` game '' the President on the numbers , but they came to realize Obama felt that way .\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake tweeted in response to reports of the memoir , criticizing the timing of the former defense secretary 's comments .\nGates was also critical of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden , recounting a conversation between Obama and Clinton suggesting political motives for their positions on Iraq .\n`` Hillary told the president that her opposition to the [ 2007 ] surge in Iraq has been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary , \u201d Gates writes . \u201c The president conceded vaguely that opposition to the Iraq surge had been political . To hear the two of them making these admissions , and in front of me , was as surprising as it was dismaying . ''\nThe former White House official responded , `` President Obama evaluated the merits of the surge but his opposition to it was not political , rather in line with his thought that more of the same was not the right path . ''\nOf Biden , Gates wrote , `` I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades . \u201d\nHayden said Obama disagrees with Gates ' assessment of Biden and hailed the Vice President as `` one of the leading statesmen of his time . ''\nOne day after Gates book bonanza , a rare peek into Obama-Biden lunch\nFor as scathing as Gates was in describing the Obama administration , the former defense secretary said none of the difficulties he had with the executive branch `` compared with the pain of dealing with Congress , '' a body he describes as phony , self-centered and narrow-minded .\n`` Congress is best viewed from a distance \u2013 the farther the better \u2013 because up close , it is truly ugly , '' Gates wrote in a piece in the Wall Street Journal , which was adapted from his book .\n`` I saw most of Congress as uncivil , incompetent at fulfilling their basic constitutional responsibilities ( such as timely appropriations ) , micromanagerial , parochial , hypocritical , egotistical , thin-skinned and prone to put self ( and re-election ) before country . ''\nGates opened the piece by writing that in the numerous times he testified before Congress , he found himself `` tempted to stand up , slam the briefing book shut and quit on the spot '' because of the `` rude , insulting , belittling , bullying and all too often highly personal attacks '' one has to endure during congressional testimony .\nHe said if he had done so , he would have told Congress , `` I may be the secretary of defense , but I am also an American citizen , and there is no son of a bitch in the world who can talk to me like that . ''\n`` Members postured and acted as judge , jury and executioner , '' he wrote .\nHis hypothesis as to why so many members `` were in a permanent state of outrage : '' The members must have `` suffered from some sort of mental duress that warranted confinement or at least treatment for anger management . ''\nAnother congressional thorn in Gates ' side brought to light in his opinion editorial is how Congress handled deciding which defense instillations and bases to close during budget tightening .\nGates wrote that `` any defense facility or contract in their district or state , no matter how superfluous or wasteful , was sacrosanct , '' even if the member had `` stridently attacked the Defense Department as inefficient and wasteful . ''\nCritics of the memoir blasted Gates for publishing the critique in the middle of the Obama \u2019 s second term , saying the more appropriate move would have been to wait until after his former boss leaves the White House in 2016 .\nA source close to Gates noted that he \u2019 s a historian by nature and wanted to document what went on but did n't want to wait because he believed the content of his book is all still relevant and should be discussed real time , especially issues of war and the troops .\nThe dysfunction in Washington and the way commanders and generals were treated really upset him , the source added .\nGates disagrees that his decision to release the book now is disloyal . In fact , he believes just the opposite and stands by all of it , the source said .\nAs for Gates \u2019 stinging criticism of Congress , the source said Gates had the most disdain for the House Foreign Affairs Committee , though he didn \u2019 t give specific names of lawmakers .", "President Trump declared Tuesday that a \u201c new chapter of American greatness is now beginning \u201d as he made economic revival the centerpiece of his first address to Congress \u2013 issuing a clarion call to \u201c restart the engine of the American economy \u201d through tax cuts , better trade deals , immigration enforcement and a $ 1 trillion infrastructure program .\nHe also called on Congress to replace what he called the \u201c imploding ObamaCare disaster \u201d with legislation that lowers costs and expands access , an ambitious goal for GOP lawmakers still trying to come together on a plan .\nThe president outlined his agenda in an address to a joint session of Congress that lasted roughly an hour and focused largely on priorities at home , more than abroad . He offered a decidedly upbeat vision for the future of the country that stood in contrast to his at-times foreboding inauguration address .\n\u201c Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed . Every problem can be solved . And every hurting family can find healing , and hope , \u201d Trump said , urging lawmakers to `` join forces '' to deliver .\nTrump for the most part traded the contentious and punchy tone of the last few weeks for loftier \u2013 some might say more presidential \u2013 rhetoric . Declaring \u201c the time for small thinking is over , \u201d Trump appealed to the country to \u201c believe , once more , in America . \u201d\n\u201c A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning . A new national pride is sweeping across our nation , \u201d he said . \u201c And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp . \u201d\nHe described his address as a \u201c message of unity and strength . \u201d\nThe generally well-received speech could mark an opportunity for Trump to reset his young presidency after a rocky start in which clashes with the media and staffing controversies at times overshadowed action on the jobs front .\nIn perhaps the most memorable moment of the night , the audience broke out into extended applause as Trump introduced the widow of William `` Ryan '' Owens , the Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen last month . Carryn Owens sobbed as lawmakers gave her a standing ovation and Trump said the raid he participated in yielded vital intelligence . His \u201c legacy is etched into eternity , \u201d Trump said .\nIn between the more dramatic moments were a host of policy prescriptions that could have a big impact on discussions in Congress .\nTrump called for a \u201c national rebuilding , \u201d urging Congress to pass legislation that produces a $ 1 trillion public-private investment in infrastructure .\nSpeaking to a key campaign promise that has yet to be realized , he said his team is developing \u201c historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. \u201d He vowed a \u201c big , big cut \u201d including \u201c massive tax relief for the middle class . \u201d\nAnd he urged Congress to replace ObamaCare \u201c with reforms that expand choice , increase access , lower costs , and at the same time , provide better health care . \u201d\nHe outlined \u201c principles \u201d to guide negotiations , including a call for Americans with pre-existing coverage to keep access to care , for states to have \u201c flexibility \u201d with Medicaid , and for Americans to be able to buy insurance across state lines .\nCalling education the \u201c civil rights issue of our time , \u201d Trump also urged Congress to pass an education bill funding \u201c school choice . \u201d\nWhile laying out his agenda , Trump touted his early-administration accomplishments while claiming he inherited many problems .\nAnd as he did during the presidential campaign , he pushed a nationalist message , making big promises for what will happen when America puts its citizens first : \u201c Dying industries will come roaring back to life . \u2026 Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads , bridges , tunnels , airports and railways gleaming across our very , very beautiful land . \u2026 Above all else , we will keep our promises to the American people . \u201d\nHe said his job is to represent the United States , not the world .\nIn calling to \u201c restart \u201d the American jobs engine , Trump said the U.S. must make it \u201c easier for companies to do business in the United States , and much , much harder for companies to leave our country . \u201d\nHe also defended his stepped-up deportations and other border security plans , casting his immigration agenda as part of the broader economic plan . By enforcing immigration laws , he said , \u201c we will raise wages , help the unemployed , save billions and billions of dollars , and make our communities safer for everyone. \u201d He joined GOP lawmakers seeking reforms to legal immigration \u2013 and potentially reopened the broader debate in Congress by saying immigration reform is possible .\nTrump 's first official status report to Congress came amid a fast-paced opening volley of activity at the start of his term : a slew of executive actions , a forthcoming budget proposal and various side-deals with American companies aimed at creating jobs . Trump was eager to highlight those accomplishments , but also faces early challenges : an order suspending refugee and other admissions on hold by the courts , questions about his team \u2019 s contacts with Russia and a Congress that has not yet moved legislation on key priorities .\nThe biggest task ahead is Republicans \u2019 drive to repeal and replace ObamaCare . As Trump appealed for a comprehensive package , some in the party have been divided over the plans being privately discussed at the Capitol .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan played down divisions ahead of Tuesday \u2019 s speech . \u201c This is a plan that we are all working on together , \u201d he told reporters . \u201c There aren \u2019 t rival plans here . \u201d\nAfter the speech , Ryan applauded Trump for what he called a `` home run .

In 1993 , seeking to to marshal grassroots support for his health-care reform effort , his team \u2019 s first impulse was to set up a standalone entity that could anonymously raise and spend large sums of money on polling , petition drives , phone banks and TV commercials .\nObama \u2019 s got big plans for OFA , and the group \u2019 s leaders are heavy on ambition for what they \u2019 ll be able to do to make the president \u2019 s agenda on issues like gun control and immigration a reality . But while campaign finance laws have changed over the years , some of the same problems \u2014 in both the law and public perception \u2014 that hounded previous White House-connected outside influence efforts could lay ahead for Obama . And , so far , neither the White House nor OFA is saying much about how they plan to avoid them .\nBy June 1993 , \u201c The National Health Care Campaign \u201d to support Clinton \u2019 s health plan was up and running with 27 staffers in a downtown Washington office , funded by $ 100,000 in seed money from the Democratic National Committee , according to a Washington Post article at the time . The group \u2019 s goal : raise up to $ 37 million in large chunks from corporations , unions and wealthy individuals .\nBut the group came under attack over ethical questions about how an entity so closely connected to the White House would seek large sums of money from business interests that could be dramatically affected by health reform .\nAs with Obama \u2019 s new OFA , the Clinton effort immediately raised questions about what control White House officials would have over the new group \u2019 s activities and fundraising . Lawyers in the Clinton White House advised that officials could \u201c pass paper \u201d to the new organization , but could not coordinate with them , the Post reported .\n\u201c This is the smelliest ethical thing they \u2019 ve done so far , \u201d Glen Bolger , a Republican pollster told Newhouse News at the time . \u201c If you are a pharmaceutical company and you get a call to contribute , it \u2019 s kind of hard to say no . \u201d\nCritics also disputed the Clinton-era group \u2019 s claim to be independent of the DNC .\n\u201c We started out as a separate entity and that , itself , became an issue , \u201d recalled Heather Booth , a top organizer for the National Health Care Campaign . \u201c Those who didn \u2019 t want health care reform came after us . \u2026 It was such an issue that it was decided that it was easier to move it back into the DNC than to waste energy defending it . \u201d\nOn the same day as the Post \u2019 s front-page article , the DNC announced it was reversing course , pulling the plug on the freestanding 501c4 lobbying group , and bringing its work back in house . The effort continued on at the DNC but was ultimately swamped by the insurance industry \u2019 s \u201c Harry and Louise \u201d ad campaign , which eventually spent $ 60 million to defeat Clinton \u2019 s plan .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t have the money we really needed to do that sort of thing , \u201d Clinton adviser Harold Ickes told \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure [ we ] moved one vote . \u201d\n\u201c We tried to figure out different ways , figure out some external apparatus or support for health reform , \u201d recalled Chris Jennings , one of Clinton \u2019 s top health care policy advisers . \u201c It was very tough , as I recall . I don \u2019 t know if it was political or policy or legal or some combination . \u201d", "Federal Lawsuit Against President Trump 's Business Interests Allowed To Proceed\nIn a blow to President Trump , a federal judge says a lawsuit that alleges Trump 's business interests violate the Constitution can proceed .\nFederal District Judge Peter Messitte denied the Department of Justice 's request to dismiss a case brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia . The Emoluments Clause bars any president from personally profiting from his dealings with foreign governments \u2014 or even U.S. state governments .\nIt 's the first ruling in federal court to define `` emolument , '' which goes undefined in the U.S. Constitution 's two emoluments clauses .\nMessitte rejected the `` cramped interpretation '' of the term offered by the Justice Department . He wrote that the term applies to `` any profit , gain or advantage '' of value that Trump has gotten from foreign , the federal or domestic governments .\n`` Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the President has been receiving or is potentially able to receive 'emoluments ' from foreign , the federal and state governments in violation of the Constitution , '' wrote Messitte .\nUntil the Trump administration , emoluments have been an obscure part of the Constitution , said John Mikhail , a professor at Georgetown University Law Center , whose research was cited in Messitte 's opinion .\n`` I think it comes as a surprise to many people that there are terms in the Constitution , individual words that at this late date , 230-plus years into the operation of the Constitution , that those have never been authoritatively adjudicated , '' said Mikhail .\nThe judge 's decision clears the way for the Maryland and District of Columbia legal teams to begin the discovery process , which could include requesting sensitive financial information from the president and the Trump Organization .\nThe Justice Department , which represents Trump in this matter , argues the clause is not relevant to Trump 's businesses . `` We continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed , '' said Andy Reuss , a spokesman for the Justice Department .\nIt 's the second victory for Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine , who were granted legal standing to sue Trump in March . They allege their jurisdictions are economically and financially harmed as political and diplomatic officials shift their business to Trump 's downtown Washington , D.C. , hotel from nearby convention centers owned by those governments .\n`` Today 's historic ruling is a substantial step forward to ensure President Trump stops violating our nation 's original anti-corruption laws , '' said Racine . `` The Constitution is clear : The president ca n't accept money or other benefits from foreign or domestic governments . ''\nAfter opening shortly before the 2016 election , the Trump International Hotel has quickly became a favorite gathering place for the president 's supporters , who frequently hold fundraisers and conferences there . Foreign governments have also held events and put dignitaries up in the hotel .\nThe hotel is housed in the Old Post Office , which is owned by the federal government and leased by the Trump Organization . Legal challenges to the Trump Organization 's lease on the property have not succeeded .", "President Obama has chosen Loretta Lynch , the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn , N.Y. , as his nominee to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder -- ending widespread speculation over who might fill Holder 's shoes and teeing up a nomination debate potentially during the lame-duck session .\nThough several Republicans had wanted to wait to consider any successor until the new Congress is seated , the president plans to announce his pick on Saturday .\n`` Ms. Lynch is a strong , independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. Attorney 's offices in the country , '' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement . `` She will succeed Eric Holder , whose tenure has been marked by historic gains in the areas of criminal justice reform and civil rights enforcement . ''\nLynch , 55 , is a Harvard Law School graduate and popular prosecutor who is currently serving her second stint as U.S. attorney for Eastern New York , which covers Brooklyn , Queens , Staten Island and Long Island .\nShe was appointed by Obama in 2010 . If confirmed to fill Holder 's post , she would be the first black female attorney general .\nIt was unclear how the nomination will be greeted by Republicans on Capitol Hill , who were often at odds with Holder over the course of his tenure . The party won a majority in the Senate on Tuesday , but will not take control until January .\nIt was also unclear if the Senate might wait on a vote until then .\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , who presumably will become the majority leader in the next session , issued a statement Friday night urging the Senate to wait until January to vote on the nomination .\n`` Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate , '' he said . `` And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order . ''\nAnnmarie McAvoy , an attorney and former federal prosecutor who worked directly under Lynch during her first tenure as U.S. Attorney from 1999-2001 , said , \u201c She \u2019 s got a good reputation \u2026she \u2019 s done some great work in her office . She \u2019 s not one to put her head in the sand . She \u2019 s hasn \u2019 t been afraid to go after corruption , things like that , against Republicans and Democrats . \u201d\nShe described Lynch as well liked , respected and not likely to cause a stir politically . \u201c I have not heard anything controversial about her \u2013 at all , \u201d McAvoy told Foxnews.com .\n\u201c When you meet her she is very sweet and she is very personable , she is very bright . She handles herself beautifully , but she doesn \u2019 t shy away from controversy . \u201d\nLynch grew up in Durham , North Carolina , the middle of three children . Her mother was a school librarian , her father a Baptist minister .\nAfter Harvard , Lynch served as a federal prosecutor in New York \u2019 s Eastern District , receiving several key promotions over eight years until President Clinton nominated her as U.S. Attorney in 1998 . After leaving that office in 2001 , Lynch went into private practice specializing in commercial litigation , white collar criminal defense and corporate compliance issues before Obama appointed her in 2010 to return to her current post .\n\u201c President Barack Obama has chosen a great New Yorker as the country \u2019 s highest-ranking law enforcement official , \u201d New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Friday after news of the nomination .\nIn her time as U.S. Attorney , Lynch has made a name for herself in a number of high-profile convictions , including a thwarted Al Qaeda-sanctioned plot to attack the New York subway system , and pursuing the head of a Mexican drug cartel for 12 murders . She also heads the government \u2019 s prosecution of Rep. Michael Grimm , R-N.Y. , who has been charged with tax evasion but won re-election Tuesday night .\nThere have been no indications thus far if Lynch \u2019 s nomination will be as dramatic as other Obama picks .\nSen. Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , who is currently the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- which must approve Obama \u2019 s nominee -- appeared welcoming in his comments Friday night .\n\u201c Being selected to serve as our nation \u2019 s top law enforcement officer is both a tremendous honor and responsibility . As we move forward with the confirmation process , I have every confidence that Ms. Lynch will receive a very fair , but thorough , vetting by the Judiciary Committee , \u201d he said in a statement. \u201c I look forward to learning more about her , how she will interact with Congress , and how she proposes to lead the department . \u201d\nReports throughout the week suggested that Lynch was not an Obama insider so she doesn \u2019 t bring the baggage carried by other potential administration nominees .\n\u201c Unlike Eric Holder , who was very close to the president \u2013 in a way , too close \u2013 she doesn \u2019 t really have any relationship with President Obama , \u201d said Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers . \u201c I think that bodes well for her . \u201d\nLynch is reportedly close to Holder , however , having served on his Attorney General \u2019 s Advisory Committee of U.S . Attorneys ( AGAC ) , a 20-member body that provides counsel to Holder on policy .\nSen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , who sits on the Judiciary Committee , has already indicated that he is unhappy Obama is making the nomination now , instead of during the new session , when Republicans will have the majority in both chambers . \u201c Democrat senators who just lost their seats should n't confirm ( a ) new Attorney General , \u201d he tweeted on Friday . \u201c ( They ) should be vetted by ( the ) new Congress . \u201d", "WASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The U.S. Secret Service on Sunday denied a suggestion from President Donald Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer that it had vetted a meeting between the president \u2019 s son and Russian nationals during the 2016 campaign .\nDonald Trump Jr. has acknowledged that he met in New York with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after he was told she might have damaging information about his father \u2019 s rival , Democrat Hillary Clinton .\n\u201c Well , I wonder why the Secret Service , if this was nefarious , why the Secret Service allowed these people in . The president had Secret Service protection at that point , and that raised a question with me , \u201d Jay Sekulow , a member of the president \u2019 s legal team , said on Sunday on the ABC news program \u201c This Week . \u201d\nIn an emailed response to questions about Sekulow \u2019 s comments , Secret Service spokesman Mason Brayman said the younger Trump was not under Secret Service protection at the time of the meeting , which included Trump \u2019 s son and two senior campaign officials .\n\u201c Donald Trump , Jr. was not a protectee of the USSS in June , 2016 . Thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with at that time , \u201d the statement said .\nAccording to emails released by Trump Jr. last week , he eagerly agreed to meet Veselnitskaya , who he was told was a Russian government lawyer . Veselnitskaya has said she is a private lawyer and denies having Kremlin ties .\nOn Friday , NBC News reported that a lobbyist who was once a Soviet counter-intelligence officer participated in the meeting , which was also attended by Trump \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and the president \u2019 s former campaign manager , Paul Manafort .\nThe meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trump \u2019 s election campaign and Russia , a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel .\nMoscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion .\nSekulow \u2019 s comments about the Secret Service drew quick criticism , including from Frances Townsend , who advised former Republican President George W. Bush on homeland security .\n\u201c Ok let \u2019 s try to deflect blame & throw those in @ SecretService who protect @ POTUS @ realDonaldTrump @ FLOTUS & family under the bus , \u201d she said on Twitter .\nThe Secret Service \u2019 s mission is to provide physical protection for the U.S. president . The agency also protects major presidential candidates . But its role in vetting people who meet with a U.S. president or candidates is limited to ensuring physical safety .\nTrump himself has said he was unaware of the meeting between his son and the Russian lawyer until a few days ago .\n\u201c The president was not aware about this meeting , did not participate in this meeting , \u201d Sekulow told the CBS program \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\nSekulow added that Trump was not aware of any meetings between his campaign staff and Russians .\nA federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to hurt Clinton and help Trump . They are also investigating potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign .\nSenator Mark Warner , the top Democrat on one of the panels investigating the matter , the Senate Intelligence Committee , told CNN : \u201c The level of credibility from the senior level of this administration really is suspect . \u201d\nWarner said he wanted to hear from everyone who attended the June 2016 meeting .\n\u201c Whether we will be able to get the Russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question , ( but ) those people that our committee has jurisdiction over , the Americans , I sure as heck want to talk to all of them , \u201d Warner said .", "House Minority Leader Nacy Pelosi remains the most successful non-presidential political fundraiser in U.S. history , raising more than $ 560 million for House Democrats since she became leader in 2003 . | Getty Congress Pelosi faces growing doubts among Dems after Georgia loss There 's a lot of grumbling by rank-and-file members , but no leadership change is imminent .\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats put a brave face on Wednesday morning after a disappointing loss in the Georgia special election , yet there is no disguising the unhappiness in the party ranks .\nThere is no challenge to Pelosi \u2019 s leadership , and none is going to happen at this point , said numerous Democrats . But it \u2019 s clear frustration is growing with the longtime Democratic leader following the extensive losses Democrats have suffered over the past half-decade .\nAnd the fact that Republicans spent millions of dollars on TV ads tying Democratic hopeful Jon Ossoff to Pelosi \u2014 and the brand of progressive policies she represents \u2014 shows that she will once again be an issue for Democratic challengers in the very districts that the party needs to win to make her speaker again .\nSome Democrats want to replace Pelosi atop their caucus , as they have since last November \u2019 s poor showing at the polls ; they say there is no way to get back in the majority with her as their leader . And others who backed her in last year \u2019 s leadership challenge have now flipped their stance .\n\u201c I think you \u2019 d have to be an idiot to think we could win the House with Pelosi at the top , \u201d said Rep.

Pelosi also pointed out that Ossoff lost by only a small margin in the 6th Congressional District race \u2014 3.8 percent \u2014 far smaller than the previous Democratic candidate for the seat lost by in November .\nPelosi , though , admitted : \u201c A loss is a loss . It is a setback . Unfortunately , a loss for us . But not good news \u201d for Republicans . Pelosi also cautioned her members not to overreact to the results of this specific race .\nPelosi didn \u2019 t talk to members about the GOP ads focusing on her . No members brought up the issue of her leadership or said she should step aside .\nPelosi pointed out that Democrats won the special-election fights during the 2009-10 cycle , only to lose 63 seats in November 2010 , while in 2005-06 \u2014 when Democrats won the House \u2014 they lost several special elections .\nAnd Pelosi talked about how the recent shooting of Rep.

Trump may have historically bad poll numbers for this point in his presidency , but Democrats are likely to need more than that to get back in the majority .\nPelosi still has a lot going for her . She remains the most successful nonpresidential political fundraiser in U.S. history , raising more than $ 560 million for House Democrats since she became leader in 2003 , even though critics say all the money doesn \u2019 t matter if they keep losing .

Instead , they say , it must focus on local issues in order to reach voters . And official Washington \u2019 s obsession with the Trump-Russia probe , while vitally important , is not something average voters are focusing on daily .\n\u201c I think what people are looking for is that they want to believe someone knows where they are coming from . They want to believe that you \u2019 re a decent person , \u201d said Rep. Tim Walz ( D-Minn. ) , who is running for governor . \u201c I think the race in my district , I think that President Trump would still win it , although it would be closer .

Darrell Issa warned Attorney General Eric Holder late Monday that if the Justice Department failed to turn over documents he is seeking , the California Republican will go ahead with a contempt vote against Holder as planned later this week .\nIssa , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , has been battling with DOJ since last year over documents related to the failed Fast and Furious program . The two sides had seemed close to making a deal late last week , but Issa cautioned Holder that he will only delay the contempt vote \u2014 set for his panel on Wednesday \u2014 if DOJ makes the Fast and Furious material available by Tuesday .\nIssa and Holder are scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee \u2019 s offices in the Rayburn House Office Building .\n\u201c As the department has not yet produced these documents \u2014 and unless it does so tomorrow morning \u2014 I will not be able to offer you the committee \u2019 s assessment of them at tomorrow \u2019 s meeting , \u201d Issa said in his letter to Holder , the latest in a flurry of public missives between the two sides .\nIssa wants information related to a Feb. 4 , 2011 , letter from DOJ downplaying top officials knowledge of what occurred during the Fast and Furious operation . That letter was later withdrawn by DOJ as inaccurate , and Hill Republicans have been trying to determine how the incident occurred .\nIssa also dismissed what Holder has called the \u201c extraordinary accommodation \u201d made by DOJ in deciding to turn over \u201c internal deliberative documents \u201d to congressional investigators . DOJ had previously said such documents were not subject to congressional subpoenas .\n\u201c There is nothing extraordinary about an offer from a federal agency to fully or partially respond to a subpoena , \u201d Issa told Holder . \u201c I do , however , hope the department will decide to produce the documents that would justify a postponement [ of Wednesday \u2019 s vote ] and will use tomorrow \u2019 s discussion to better understand what steps it can take if it sincerely seeks an outcome other than continuation of contempt proceedings . \u201d\nDOJ officials met with Issa \u2019 s investigators last week to turn over some materials , and discussions between the two sides were ongoing throughout the weekend , GOP insiders said .\nMaryland Rep. Elijah Cummings , the top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , will be part of the session with Holder .\nIssa \u2014 backed by Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) and other House GOP leaders \u2014 has subpoenaed thousands of pages of DOJ documents related to the Fast and Furious \u201c gun walking \u201d program .\nThat operation , run jointly by DOJ and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , allowed thousands of guns purchased in the United States to reach Mexican drug cartels as federal agents attempted to track them .\nBut the effort failed and two U.S. law-enforcement officers were killed using Fast and Furious weapons , leading to outrage on Capitol Hill .\nIssa \u2019 s panel issued a subpoena last October for the Fast and Furious materials , particularly information related to the Feb. 2011 letter . Holder and other DOJ officials have refused for months to turn over those documents , arguing that previous administrations withheld similar \u201c internal deliberative \u201d information .\nYet with what Holder called a \u201c constitutional crisis \u201d looming over Fast and Furious , Issa and Holder appeared close to a deal to postpone the contempt vote late last week . Holder offered to turn over some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the documents Issa has been seeking . In return , Holder sought a face-to-face meeting with Issa to resolve their dispute . Holder called the move an \u201c extraordinary accommodation \u201d to the demands of congressional investigators .\nThe battle with DOJ over Fast and Furious has become a test of strength for Issa and the House GOP leadership . Boehner and other top party leaders initially did not want to get into a showdown with Holder and the White House , fearing it would distract Republicans from the economic-based message that they have been pushing all year . Congress faces deadlines this month on highway and student loan funding , issues with far broader impact than the Fast and Furious debate , despite the seriousness of the DOJ-House fight .", "Rep.

And he offered to personally brief the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , in the next few days .\n`` We believe that this briefing , and the documents we are prepared to provide ... will fully address the remaining concerns identified in the recent letters to me from you and House leadership , '' Holder said in a letter to Issa . `` The department 's willingness to provide these materials is a serious , good faith effort to bring this matter to an amicable resolution . ''\nIssa 's office said in an early response that Holder 's letter `` only seems to indicate a willingness to offer a selective telling '' of key events and that the chairman is still asking the Justice Department to explain `` how it is prepared to alter its opposition to producing subpoenaed documents ''\nEarlier Thursday , Holder 's allies on the committee mounted their own aggressive defense of the attorney general , circulating a memo to House Democrats that calls the Republican argument for contempt , laid out in a contempt citation last month , `` irresponsible , unprecedented , and contrary to the rule of law . ''\nFor more than a year , Republicans have been leading an investigation into `` Fast and Furious , '' which was launched in Arizona in late 2009 by Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives officials , with help from the U.S. attorney 's office there . The operation 's targets bought nearly 2,000 weapons over several months . But for reasons that are still in dispute , most of the weapons sold were never followed , and high-powered weapons tied to the investigation ended up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States , including the December 2010 murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry .\nLate last year , Issa issued a subpoena to Holder , and the Justice Department subsequently identified more than 80,000 documents responsive to it .\nHowever , the department has turned over about 7,600 documents and insisted those not turned over include traditionally protected deliberative material , legally protected grand jury material and other investigative material relating to ongoing cases .\nIn recent days , Issa narrowed his demands to focus on correspondence between department officials after they sent a now-retracted letter to Congress on Feb. 4 , 2011 . In that letter , the department inaccurately insisted : `` ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico . ''\nIssa says the documents he wants are `` critically important '' because , among other things , they could show whether top officials were `` surprised or were already aware '' about `` gunwalking '' in `` Fast and Furious '' when confronted with evidence contradicting the Feb. 4 letter . And the documents could further detail how the department handled officials who were negligent .\nIn his letter Thursday , Holder said he appreciates Issa 's `` narrowed '' request for information , calling it `` an important step forward '' and noting the department has `` repeatedly expressed concern that the production of ( certain ) materials would undermine the integrity and independence of ( its ) core law enforcement operations . ''\nHolder said he is willing to turn over documents that , `` while outside the scope of the committee 's interest in the inappropriate tactics used in Fast and Furious , '' show how his department 's `` understanding '' of the facts `` evolved throughout 2011 '' and how the Feb. 4 , 2011 , letter came to be withdrawn .\nBut in his letter , Holder insisted department leaders drafted the inaccurate letter based on assertions from others that the allegations being made were `` categorically false . ''\nHe also insisted , `` The record in this matter reflects that until allegations about the inappropriate tactics used in Fast and Furious were made public , department leadership was unaware of those tactics . ''\nRepublicans scheduled the contempt vote against Holder for June 20 after accusing him of failing to comply with the subpoena and turn over tens of thousands of still-undisclosed documents . The measure , if it remains on the agenda , would be voted on at the committee level and would still have to be approved by the full House .\nIn the memo circulated Thursday , Democrats said , `` Holding the attorney general in contempt of Congress for protecting these documents is an extreme and blatant abuse of the congressional contempt power and undermines the credibility of the committee . ''\nBut a spokeswoman for Issa took issue with that assessment , saying , `` The only credibility that has been undermined is that of Attorney General Holder and the Justice Department who issued a false denial of reckless conduct . ''\nNevertheless , House Democrats also took aim more broadly at the Republicans ' investigation of `` Operation Fast and Furious , '' saying it `` has been characterized by a series of unsubstantiated allegations against the Obama administration that later turned out to be inaccurate . ''\n`` Rather than conducting this investigation in an even-handed manner , the committee has politicized this inquiry by systematically refusing to investigate gunwalking operations during the Bush administration and by disregarding clear evidence that contradicts ( their ) political narrative , '' the Democrats ' memo states .\nOne of the `` most significant flaws of the investigation , '' according to the memo , is Issa 's refusal to hold a public hearing with former ATF head Ken Melson , who told congressional investigators in July 2011 that he never informed senior Justice Department officials about the tactics of `` Fast and Furious '' because he did n't know them himself .\nIn addition , the memo states , Issa has refused multiple requests for the committee to hear from former Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who could discuss `` the origination and evolution of gunwalking operations '' dating back to 2006 .\nIn late 2007 , Mukasey was sent a memo noting that the `` first-ever attempt '' to have a `` controlled delivery '' of weapons smuggled into Mexico was `` unsuccessful '' in tracking the weapons , but ATF would still like to `` expand the possibility '' of such cases with Mexico . It 's unclear if Mukasey ever saw the memo .\nThe spokeswoman for Issa , Becca Watkins , said the Democrats ' criticism is based on a `` fundamental misunderstanding '' about the facts of the case and the Justice Department 's `` failure to comply '' with the subpoena .\nAs for the contempt vote scheduled for Wednesday , the Democrats ' memo said negotiations could last into next week , and `` it is important for committee members to be fully prepared in the event that negotiations are unsuccessful . ''\nIn his letter Thursday , Holder told Issa that `` as the chairman only you have the authority to bind the committee , '' and therefore a meeting between the two `` is required both to assure that there are no misunderstandings about this matter and to confirm that the elements of the proposal we are making will be deemed sufficient to render the process of contempt unnecessary .

Trump \u2019 s lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , said in a statement that any suggestion that Trump told Cohen to lie is \u201c categorically false . \u201d\nRepresentatives for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on the BuzzFeed report .\nCohen , who once said he was so loyal to Trump that he would \u201c take a bullet \u201d for him , is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to charges including campaign finance violations , tax evasion and lying to Congress .\nIf Trump did tell Cohen to lie , that would constitute criminal activity , said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler , a Democrat . He added that he would look into the matter .\n\u201c Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime , \u201d Nadler said on Twitter .\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the allegation that Trump may have directed Cohen to lie under oath \u201c is among the most serious to date . \u201d\nRelated Coverage Trump says grateful to Mueller for BuzzFeed statement\n\u201c We will do what \u2019 s necessary to find out if it \u2019 s true , \u201d Schiff , also a Democrat , said on Twitter .\nSome Senate Intelligence Committee investigators hope to ask Cohen about the BuzzFeed report when he testifies behind closed doors in February , a committee source told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . He also will face questions about it in testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 7 .\nYet Mueller \u2019 s move to push back on the BuzzFeed report could give some lawmakers pause , while also giving ammunition to allies of Trump in their efforts to criticize the media and in their calls for Mueller to complete his probe .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s development only underscores the need for the special counsel to wrap this investigation up immediately , \u201d Republican Representative Mark Meadows said on Twittter . \u201c The constant secrecy and breathless speculation helps no one . \u201d\nLegal experts said the allegation , if true , exposed Trump to a new level of risk in an investigation that has already resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from four former campaign aides , including ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort .\nIf true , \u201c it \u2019 s a seismic event , \u201d Andy Wright , an associate White House counsel under former Democratic President Barack Obama , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nCohen , his left arm in a sling , did not comment as he entered his apartment building in New York on Friday .

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment .\nWhile the Justice Department has previously concluded that a sitting president can not be charged while in office , such an allegation , if found true , could fuel impeachment proceedings in Congress .\nTrump repeatedly has denied collusion with Russia and slammed Mueller \u2019 s investigation as a \u201c witch hunt. \u201d Russia also has rejected U.S. intelligence findings that Moscow interfered in U.S. politics in the 2016 election in an effort to boost Trump .\nTrump said during the presidential campaign that he had no ties or business dealings with Russia .\nDemocrats , who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month , have generally been cautious regarding any talk of impeachment to remove Trump from office although some rank-and-file members have pushed for such a resolution .\nImpeachment proceedings would face an uphill battle in the Senate , where Trump \u2019 s fellow Republicans have a majority .\nBuzzFeed also reported that Cohen regularly updated Trump \u2019 s son Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Ivanka Trump , who is now a top White House adviser , about the Moscow project .\nA combination photo shows U.S. President Donald Trump 's onetime personal attorney , Michael Cohen and U.S. President Donald Trump from outside federal court in the Manhattan borough of New York City , New York , U.S. , April 16 , 2018 and in the White House in Washington , U.S. , July 18 , 2018 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Lucas Jackson , Leah Millis/File Photos\nA spokesman for Abbe Lowell , a lawyer for Ivanka Trump , said she was minimally involved in the development .

ET : Scroll down to see the GOP plan , which has now been released ; new comments from Rep. Ryan ; and White House reaction . )\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee , unveiled his latest budget plan Tuesday morning \u2014 and as NPR 's Tamara Keith told our Newscast Desk , he says it would bring the federal budget in balance by 2023 .\nRyan 's previous proposal , he said , would balance the budget in 20 years . How has he cut 10 years off that time ? The `` fiscal cliff '' deal reached as 2012 turned into 2013 `` raises $ 600 billion in tax revenue over the next decade , '' Tamara reported , `` and Ryan is including that in his new budget . ''\n`` Otherwise , '' she added , `` Ryan has telegraphed that his new plan will include many of the same cuts as past GOP budgets , most notably it would convert Medicare into a premium support program . ''\nOn the op/ed pages of The Wall Street Journal today , Ryan makes his case for the new plan .\n`` How do we do it ? '' he writes . `` We stop spending money the government does n't have . ... Our budget matches spending with income . Under our proposal , the government spends no more than it collects in revenue \u2014 or 19.1 % of gross domestic product each year . As a result , we 'll spend $ 4.6 trillion less over the next decade . ... `` Our opponents will shout austerity , but let 's put this in perspective . On the current path , we 'll spend $ 46 trillion over the next 10 years . Under our proposal , we 'll spend $ 41 trillion . On the current path , spending will increase by 5 % each year . Under our proposal , it will increase by 3.4 % . Because the U.S. economy will grow faster than spending , the budget will balance by 2023 , and debt held by the public will drop to just over half the size of the economy . ''\nPresident Obama and his fellow Democrats , of course , have other ideas about how to get the federal government books in order . Politico this morning looks at the president 's new efforts to reach out to some Republicans in order to cut a deal . It concludes though , that `` the expectations for both a sustainable civil alliance and a grand bargain remain low for one very simple reason : The parties are further apart on taxes and entitlements than they were in 2011 when Obama and House Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) first entered into talks and came close to striking the ever-elusive grand bargain . ''\nUpdate at 11:20 a.m . ET . White House Says Ryan 's Math `` Just Does n't Add Up . ''\nIn a statement just sent to reporters , the White House says , in part :\n`` While the House Republican budget aims to reduce the deficit , the math just does n't add up . Deficit reduction that asks nothing from the wealthiest Americans has serious consequences for the middle class . By choosing to give the wealthiest Americans a new tax cut , this budget as written will either fail to achieve any meaningful deficit reduction , raise taxes on middle class families by more than $ 2,000 \u2013 or both . ... `` The president has put forward a balanced approach to deficit reduction with no sacred cows . It includes more Medicare savings over the next decade than the House Republican budget , but it does so by cracking down on waste and fraud , not by asking middle class seniors to bear the burden . It closes tax loopholes for the wealthiest and biggest corporations so we can still afford to create jobs by investing in education , manufacturing , infrastructure , and small businesses . The President 's plan puts our nation on a fiscally sustainable path and grows our economy from the middle class out . `` While the president disagrees with the House Republican approach , we all agree we need to leave a better future for our children . The President will continue to work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to grow the economy and cut the deficit in a balanced way . This is the approach the American people overwhelmingly support , and that is what the president will continue to fight for each day . ''\nUpdate at 10:55 a.m . ET . Ryan Says He Wo n't Surrender His Principles :\nRyan is holding a news conference this hour . A reporter noted that he 's pitched a similar budget plan before \u2014 one that focuses on cuts in projected spending and eschews tax increases \u2014 and in the time since then was on the losing presidential ticket .\nShould losing an election mean `` we surrender our principles ? '' Ryan asks . That Republicans should `` stop believing in what we believe in ? ''\n`` We think we owe the country a balanced budget , '' he says , and `` solutions '' to the nation 's problems .\nRyan 's `` Path to Prosperity ; a Responsible , Balanced Budget , '' plan is now out . As Tamara notes , `` it calls for the repeal of the president 's healthcare law , and approval of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline . It would cut growth in programs for the poor by turning them over to the states . And for future seniors , it would convert Medicare into a premium support program . ''", "Government wants you to play a role in the `` shutdown '' of the federal government . Your role is to panic .\nRepublicans and Democrats both assume that shutting some government is a terrible thing . The press concurs . `` Shutdown threatens fragile economy , '' warns Politico . `` Federal workers turn to prayer , '' laments The Washington Post .\nIf the public starts noticing that life goes on as usual without all 3.4 million federal workers , we might get dangerous ideas , like doing without so much government . Politicians do n't want that .\nThey 'd rather have us worry about how America will cope .\nPresident Obama gave a speech where he actually said we need to keep government open for the sake of people like the person working for the Department of Agriculture `` out there helping some farmers make sure that they 're making some modest profit , '' and the Department of Housing and Urban Development `` helping somebody buy a house for the first time . ''\nGive me a break . Farmers do n't need bureaucrats to teach them how to make a profit , and Americans can buy first homes without HUD helping a chosen few . Americans would make more profit and afford better homes if they did n't have to spend a third of national income on federal taxes .\nBureaucrats , acting like bullies , protest the partial closures by doing things like cutting off access to public parks\u2014even privately funded ones . Federal cops block access to outdoor war memorials and much of Mt . Rushmore . They block access to motels and order people out of private homes that happen to sit on federal land . The Washington Free Beacon reports , `` The closure of a Virginia park that sits on federal land , even though the government provides no resources for its maintenance or operation . ''\nIt 's similar to the fake `` austerity measures '' in other countries . We 're told that Europe 's slow economic growth is a result of `` austerity '' embraced by European governments .\nBut there has n't really been any austerity . England , where a `` conservative '' government is in charge , ( SET ITAL ) increased ( END ITAL ) government spending by 4 percent .\n`` Austerity '' in Greece\u2014supposedly so drastic that the public has little choice but to riot in protest\u2014meant changes like reducing mandatory severance pay to one entire year ( instead of two ! ) .\nIn the U.S. , Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D-Cal . ) told CNN the federal government has cut so much spending that there 's just nothing left to cut : `` The cupboard is bare ! There 's no more cuts to make ! ''\nWhat ? The federal government spends almost 4 trillion dollars ! The government cupboard overflows ! We fund entire cabinet departments that are worse than useless . The Labor Department ( SET ITAL ) interferes ( END ITAL ) with actual labor . Commerce would flow more smoothly without Commerce Department bureaucrats channeling money to their cronies .\nThe government has n't cut spending\u2014it never does . After the last shutdowns , politicians even voted to award retroactive pay to government workers who did n't work . Bet they do it again this time . The federal government remains the biggest employer in the country . President Obama says so with pride .\nCompare this to what happens in the private sector in tough times : AT & T cut 40,000 workers . Sears cut 50,000 . IBM : 60,000 . They were n't easy decisions , but they enabled the companies to stay profitable . With fewer workers , leaner companies found more efficient ways to get things done .\nAnd the rest of us barely noticed . We expect change and adaptation in free-market institutions . But it does n't happen in government . Government just grows .\nMaybe the ugliest part of this story is that the city that whines most about suffering through the shutdown , Washington , D.C. , is now the richest geographic area in America . Washington got richer while the rest of America did n't . Over the past 12 years , median income in the U.S. dropped about 6.5 percent\u2014but not in D.C. ! There , it rose 23 percent . Four of the five richest counties now surround Washington , D.C .\nNo wonder politicians and bureaucrats are convinced big government is essential to keep the economy going\u2014it is essential to keep them going .", "President Trump and GOP senators buried their differences for an ...\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Thursday narrowly adopted the Senate \u2019 s $ 4 trillion budget blueprint , despite grumblings about the impact on the deficit and the elimination of state and local tax deductions .\nWith 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no , the budget passed 216-212 .\nThe House had already passed its own budget that directed upcoming tax reform legislation to be deficit-neutral . But to speed up the process toward their ultimate goal of tax cuts , the House passed the Senate plan that would allow tax cuts to add $ 1.5 trillion to the deficit .\n\u201c By passing this budget today , we can send a clear message to the American people : Real tax reform is on the way , \u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady ( R-Texas ) .\nThe budget vote opened a process called reconciliation that will allow the upcoming tax reform legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote \u2014 and without any Democrats .\nDemocrats blasted the plan as \u201c the billionaires \u2019 budget \u201d that will roll back Medicaid and Medicare spending to deliver tax relief to the wealthiest Americans .\n\u201c Snake oil is all that this Republican budget will give to the American middle class and working families , \u201d said Rep. Salud Carbajal ( D-Calif. ) . \u201c This Republican budget is squarely aimed at ramming through a tax plan without bipartisan consensus or input . \u2026 Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this plan benefits only the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans . \u201d\nRep. Diane Black ( R-Tenn. ) said Democrats shouldn \u2019 t make assumptions about a tax plan that hasn \u2019 t even been written yet .\n\u201c The devil \u2019 s in the details and those details have not yet been released yet , \u201d Black said .\nRepublicans and President Trump believe they can deliver a massive tax cut to Americans and businesses this year that will create economic growth and deliver relief to the middle class .\nOne major sticking point is how to pay for those tax cuts . The current plan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes to save about $ 1.3 trillion over the decade .\nMore than 44 million people rely on those deductions , especially in high-taxes states like New York , New Jersey and California .\nNew York Republicans voting \u201c no \u201d were Dan Donovan , Claudia Tenney , Lee Zeldin , Elise Stefanik , John Katko , Peter King and John Faso .\nFaso said he couldn \u2019 t support \u201c a budget resolution that singled out for elimination the ability of New York families to deduct state and local taxes . \u201d", "Story highlights House Republicans , President Obama still far apart on budget priorities , GOP leaders say\n`` He did himself some good , '' Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin says\nObama offered `` just a bunch of platitudes , '' Georgia congressman says\nSome in the Republican caucus think Obama should have reached out long ago\nPresident Barack Obama entered the conference room in the Capitol basement to a standing ovation , but after nearly an hour and a half of discussion with House Republicans , there was little evidence that the meeting -- part of the White House 's `` charm offensive '' on Capitol Hill -- did much to change the partisan gulf between the president and his chief adversaries .\nAt a news conference after the meeting , House Speaker John Boehner thanked the president for coming but also noted the challenges remaining on a host of issues , especially ones related to reducing the deficit .\n`` We know how there are some very real differences between our two parties ( on issues like ) jobs , balancing the budget and what do we do to get economy moving again , '' Boehner said . `` Republicans want to balance the budget . The President does n't . Republicans want to solve our long term debt problem . The President does n't . We want to unlock our energy resources to put more Americans back to work . The President does n't . ''\nThe speaker added , `` But having said that , today was a good start and I hope that these kinds of discussions can continue . ''\nRepublicans ' top priority -- tackling federal spending and reining in record deficits -- came up early in the Republican conference meeting . Oklahoma Rep. Jim Lankford asked the first question , pressing the president to explain why he would n't join House Republicans in their effort to balance the budget in a decade .\nObama , according to several Republicans , explained that he did n't share that priority , an answer that many emphasized as they left the meeting .\nGeorgia Rep. Paul Broun , a conservative who is running for the Senate , mentioned that exchange as he left , telling reporters , `` basically his whole talk was just a bunch of platitudes and no substance to it . ''\n`` He thought what was more important was that deficits fall below growth as a percentage of GDP -- certainly a laudable goal , but I think the federal government , like any business or any family , needs to work towards a balanced budget , '' Rep. Tom Cotton , R-Arkansas , said afterward .\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor gave a blunt assessment about the divide on fiscal issues , suggesting it could carry over to other issues .\n`` If the president wants to let our unwillingness to raise taxes get in the way , then we 're not gon na be able to set differences aside and focus on what we agree on , '' Cantor told reporters at the GOP leaders ' news conference .\nWhen Lankford raised fiscal issues during the meeting , he also pointed out that the president 's other meeting on Wednesday was with his political arm , Organizing for Action . Word of that meeting rankled many GOP members who suggested Obama was more concerned with political goals than working across the aisle .\n`` We know the president is going to speak before Organizing for Action tonight , '' Rep. Greg Walden , R-Oregon , who leads the House Republicans ' campaign arm , told reporters as he left the meeting . `` We know he 's made it clear that taking out the House is his big priority , and we know he 's been on the never-ending campaign tour up to this point , so there 's a trust factor . ''\nMindful of the House GOP undercurrent that Obama is chiefly focused on scoring political points , one source inside the meeting said the president addressed those concerns directly at the end of the meeting .\nThis source told CNN that the president told GOP members that if he were only focused on the midterms , he would not be pushing immigration reform because that 's not necessarily helpful for some members of his party . He said he would not push for entitlement reform because a lot of Democrats do n't agree and are nervous about tackling such a politically explosive issue .\nHe told them that he runs the country , that he wants it to succeed and that he looks around the room and sees other people who love their country . Obama said they have a moment and should seize it , according to this source .\nBut Walden did say the session helped build some trust , and it was a good opportunity to raise a wide spectrum of issues . He mentioned Israel as one area where both parties found some common ground .\nExiting the conference , House Budget Committee Chairman and former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan ( R-Wisconsin ) said of the president : `` He did himself some good . ''\nSeveral members in the meeting said it helped open a dialogue but lamented that the session was only the second time the president had traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to talk to House Republicans since he was elected .\n`` The president does n't spend a lot of time working with members of Congress . He does n't have to -- he 's president of the United States -- but I think it 's made his job a lot more difficult , and it 's made our task a lot more difficult because there 's very little communication , '' Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said after the meeting .\nCotton described the president 's demeanor in the meeting as `` affable '' and said the various members who asked questions were `` very cordial and respectful . ''\nAccording to multiple GOP sources , conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington screened questions in advance and called on members after the president made opening remarks .\nRep. Michael Grimm of New York said the event had been peppered with occasional lighter moments such as speculation after word got around the room that the new pope was about to be announced .\n`` Anyone who thinks this president is anything but affable and pleasant when he 's speaking with group is just simply wrong . They have n't met him , '' said Grimm . But he added he was waiting to see if the president would follow up his outreach with some bipartisan action .\nObama fielded some tense questions during the meeting . Michigan Rep. Candice Miller told reporters she was not satisfied with the president 's response to her complaint that the White House had suspended public tours after forced spending cuts went into effect . Republicans have charged that the closures were politically motivated , but Obama said Wednesday the decision had been made by the Secret Service .", "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump called for deep cuts in environmental and safety net programs , billions more for his border wall and a huge boost for the military in a $ 4.75 trillion 2020 budget proposal that is unlikely to gain traction in Congress .\nTrump delivered his first budget under a divided government Monday , a road map that would not balance the books for 15 years despite deep reductions . The proposal also called for $ 8.6 billion for Trump 's border wall , a request Democrats flatly rejected .\n`` Congress has been ignoring the president 's spending reductions for the last two years , '' Trump 's top budget aide , Russell Vought , told reporters when pressed for an explanation about why the budget anticipates a $ 1.1 trillion deficit next year .\nEven before Democrats claimed control of the House , similar proposals by Trump failed in Congress . The schism between the president 's wish list and actual government spending only deepened after a dispute over the border wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January .\n`` This is not a serious proposal , '' said Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee .\nPresidential budgets , required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 , for decades have had more to do with politics than policy . With the 2020 election underway , the document gives Trump an opportunity to lay out a vision he can trumpet to supporters .\nNot your budget : 'Get rid of the fat ' : Why Uncle Sam 's budget is different from yours\nThe White House is eager to sell three messages with the president 's third budget : that Trump hasn \u2019 t given up on building his long-promised border wall , that he wants to increase military spending and that he hopes to slash just about everything else .\nThe president requested $ 8.6 billion more for his wall , just weeks after Congress failed to approve his demand for $ 5.7 billion . With both sides dug in on the issue , the latest proposal is certain to go nowhere . Trump declared a national emergency in February , a move the White House says will free up billions more for the wall .\nTrump is also requesting billions more in spending at the Defense Department \u2013 one of the few priorities that could gain some attention from lawmakers . After initially considering Pentagon cuts last year , the White House embraced a proposal to increase the Defense Department \u2019 s budget 5 percent to $ 750 billion .\n\u2022 A $ 2.8 billion , or 31 percent reduction in for the Environmental Protection Agency and a $ 327 billion cut to safety-net programs . Some of that reduction would be carried out by imposing a work requirement for food stamps , Medicaid and other programs .\n\u2022 A new user fee on e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery system products to `` address today \u2019 s alarming rise in youth e-cigarette use . ''\n\u2022 Nearly $ 315 million to hire an additional 1,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 128 immigration court prosecuting attorneys .\n\u2022 Almost $ 300 million toward the goal eliminating nearly all new infections of HIV/AIDS within 10 years .\nSome proposals in Trump 's budget could become law , but most of the high-profile items will face tough odds .\nTrump has proposed many of the same changes before , without success . Last year \u2019 s budget , which came at a time when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate , included $ 18 billion for the border wall . His 2017 budget proposed eliminating 62 federal agencies entirely . Congress largely ignored those requests and many others .\nNone of those agencies was eliminated and lawmakers approved only $ 1.37 billion for border barriers . That partly reflects a politically divided Congress but also the fact that the president 's budget has long been viewed as a wish list .\nGovernment printers published about 20,000 hard copies of the president 's budget , and a spokesman for the Government Publishing Office says the online version of the document averages about 2 million retrievals each year .\nThe budget proposal must include information about how much the government collected in taxes and other revenue , the public debt and proposed spending priorities . But the real work of spending taxpayer money is handled by the congressional appropriations process . And that means Democrats and Republicans must work together to decide which programs should be prioritized .\nEven some Republicans remained noncommittal about the White House proposal .\n\u201c I look forward to reviewing additional details , '' said Sen. Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , `` Throughout the next few months , the ( committee ) will conduct hearings and carefully review the president \u2019 s proposal .

This legislator attended a meeting Wednesday involving Boehner , but requested anonymity because that gathering was private .\nCongressional Republicans remain divided on how to structure legislation to raise the government 's borrowing level . And an aide to the House speaker downplayed the development , saying , `` Boehner has always said the United States will not default on its debt , so that 's not news . ''\nStill , at least one Democrat -- Sen. Charles Schumer of New York -- cheered the prospect of the GOP leader refusing to block at least this measure that President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats strongly support .\n`` This could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough , '' Schumer said in a statement . `` Even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous , and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief . ''\nThe Ohio Republican 's vow comes exactly two weeks before the government is set to run out of money to cover its roughly $ 16.7 trillion debt , unless Congress agrees to lift the so-called debt ceiling . That had long been routine in Washington -- until recently , that is , when conservative Republicans have pushed not to allow more borrowing without significant cuts .\nJUST WATCHED GOP Rep. : You 're beautiful but be honest Replay More Videos ...

'' He accused President Barack Obama of refusing to negotiate ; Obama and fellow Democratic leaders have since said they are open to talks on any and all budgetary matters , but only after the government is reopened .\nYet Boehner 's comments signal that , at least on the debt ceiling issue , he 's willing to allow a vote on a measure backed by top Democrats but not most Republicans in his chamber -- something he 's refused to do with a Senate-passed measure to reopen the federal government , without any add-ons .\nChief among those Democrats is Obama who , for all his strong rhetoric on ending the government shutdown , has said that avoiding a federal debt default is an even bigger necessity . He 's insisted Congress pass such a measure , as is , without tying it to anything else .\n`` As reckless as a government shutdown is , an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse , '' the president said in a speech Thursday in Rockville , Maryland . `` There will be no negotiations over this . ''\nWhile Boehner 's comments suggest hope toward some common resolution on the debt ceiling , the government shutdown is another matter entirely .\nThe two sides appeared no closer to an agreement Thursday , the third day of the shutdown that comes because Congress failed to agree on a budget plan to send to President Barack Obama . In fact , they appeared to dig in -- insisting their approach is best and that the other was to blame for the 800,000 workers at risk of furloughs , shuttering of national parks , loss of funding for various programs and other effects of the shutdown .\nA conservative GOP wing has demanded that any spending measure include provisions to dismantle or defund Obamacare , which became law in 2010 and was upheld by the Supreme Court last year .\nAs he 's done before , Obama on Thursday challenged Boehner to stop what he called Republicans `` reckless '' strategy of refusing to pass the `` clean '' spending bill -- which does n't have provisions targeting the president 's signature health care reform , the Affordable Care Act , like several passed by the GOP-led House -- and instead pushing measures to fund popular programs on a one-by-one basis .\nThe president said the spending initiative passed by the Democratic-led Senate would pass the House with support from Democrats and some Republicans , except that Boehner wo n't allow the vote .\n`` The only thing that is keeping the government shut down , the only thing preventing people from going back to work , and basic research starting back up , and farmers and small-business owners getting their loans -- the only thing that 's preventing all that from happening right now today , in the next five minutes , is that Speaker John Boehner wo n't even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he does n't want to anger the extremists in his party , '' Obama said .\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid was part of the Democratic chorus Thursday , accusing Boehner of reneging on an agreement to let the House vote on a `` clean '' spending package of $ 988 billion , $ 70 billion less than Democrats wanted ) . Boehner went back on that deal , Reid surmised in an interview with CNN 's Dana Bash , because he feared fellow Republicans would turn on him and oust him from his position as House speaker .\n`` His job is not as important as our country , '' Reid said . `` ... He has to have some courage . ''\nGOP Rep. Michael Grimm said Thursday night that `` very , very arrogant and very obstinate '' remarks by Reid and what he calls a lack of needed leadership from Obama undermines the chances of reaching a deal .\n`` If you 're going to be insulted ... , and if you 're going to be spoken down to , and there 's going to be this air of arrogance , you 're only going to make things worse , '' Grimm , of New York , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper .\nWhile Grimm and a few other moderate Republicans have backed a `` clean '' spending bill without anti-Obamacare provisions , some of his colleagues in the House say the party wo n't budge from their strategy . Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas , for one , described his caucus as `` very unified '' and said Reid and Obama are `` confused '' if they think `` we 're going to fold and let them win on everything . ''\nIn fact , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor wrote in a memo that it 's the positions of Obama and other Democrats that are `` untenable . ''\nHouse Republicans would continue passing piecemeal funding measures for popular programs such as veterans affairs , national parks and medical research to keep up pressure on Senate Democrats who refuse to consider such measures in the ongoing stalemate , Cantor 's memo said .\n`` While no one can predict with certainty how the current shutdown will be resolved , I am confident that if we keep advancing common-sense solutions to the problems created by the shutdown that Senate Democrats and President Obama will eventually agree to meaningful discussions that would allow us to ultimately resolve this impasse , '' Cantor said in the memo that a GOP source made available to CNN .\nA conversation between two conservative GOP senators showed Republicans think they can win the debate . In the comments caught by live microphone , tea party-backed Sen. Rand Paul told his Kentucky Republican colleague , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , that continuing to hammer Democrats for refusing to consider GOP proposals would eventually succeed .\nMeanwhile , two moderate House members -- one Republican and one Democrat -- proposed a compromise Thursday that would fund the government for six months while eliminating a tax on medical devices in the health care reforms .\nSenate Democrats quickly rejected the idea because it would link the health care reform provision to the need to fund the government now while extending deep mandatory budget cuts they oppose for half of the new fiscal year .\nInstead , Obama -- who canceled a trip to Brunei and Indonesia for this weekend 's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because of the ongoing shutdown -- and other Democrats have said they want to negotiate a broad budget deal that could include tax reforms and other matters . But they 're only willing to engage in such talks after the government reopens .\nThis already slogging debate over what to do about the crisis ground to a halt Thursday because of something that , at first glance , did not directly involve any of the legislators on Capitol Hill , even if it did hit very close to home .\nA chase that began at a White House security checkpoint ended near the U.S. Capitol Hill when authorities opened fire on a car containing a woman and a child , an intelligence source told CNN .\nTwo police officers suffered injuries in the ordeal , according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier . The female driver -- who did n't fire any shots herself , according to multiple sources -- died of gunshot wounds .\nThe House and Senate were both put on lockdown , with no one allowed to leave or enter Capitol Hill buildings and everyone urged to steer clear of windows and doorways , for about an hour .\nNot long after , Democrats and Republicans reconvened on the House floor and , in a rare show of unanimity , thanked the responding officers .\nThen they resumed their normal business -- which , if the past few weeks is any indication , meant more blame and little agreement on how to bring the government back on line .", "Story highlights Majority of African leaders convene in Washington for first-ever African leaders summit\nEbola outbreak on the continent sure to distract from talks on trade\nU.S. hopes to be a player on the African continent and blunt China 's influence\nBy any measure it 's historic : The vast majority of Africa 's leaders flying to Washington at the invite of the President , whose father was born on the continent , to mark what the White House hopes is a new era of cooperation .\nWhile plans for the first African Leaders Summit this week in the nation 's capital are ambitious , the reality is the United States still has strides to make on the kind of political and economic relationships in Africa that can benefit both sides .\nOther nations , namely China , have turned their focus to the continent as a trade partner . Terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries , most notably in Nigeria , where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year . And while U.S.-backed efforts have helped slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa , countries there rate among the lowest in life expectancy and infant mortality .\n`` The importance of this for America needs to be understood , '' President Barack Obama said on Friday about the summit .\nJUST WATCHED West African Ebola epidemic Replay More Videos ...

''\nHere are five reasons that the U.S.-Africa Leader 's Summit , which kicked off on Monday , is important :\n1 . Health scare : The health problems in Africa were underscored this week when an Ebola outbreak prompted leaders of two nations to cancel their trips to Washington .\nLiberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , a Nobel Peace Prize winner , and Ernest Bai Koroma , the leader of Sierra Leone , both said they would remain in their countries .\nEbola has killed more than 700 people in three nations : Guinea , Liberia and Sierra .\nSummit leaders , and even Obama , have stressed there is no risk to Washingtonians from those arriving from Africa this week .\nObama said anyone who might have been exposed to the virus would be screened both in their home countries and upon arrival in the United States .\nBut worry over the worsening outbreak only highlighted challenges Africa faces in combating disease and poverty , despite the billions in U.S. aid over the years .\n`` This is an uphill challenge for them , '' said Gayle Smith , Obama 's senior director for development and Democracy , noting both Liberia and Sierra Leone had recently emerged from periods of civil war .\nObama hopes to move past the traditional elements of humanitarian aid to Africa , focusing instead on potential trade .\nBut promoting commercial ties with countries engulfed in Ebola outbreaks could prove to be difficult . The State Department warned against non-essential travel to Sierra Leone and Libera last week , and some schools and businesses have closed .\n`` The timing is very unfortunate , and no one would have wished for this , '' said Howard French , an associate professor of international affairs at Columbia University . `` Having high-level discussions between the U.S. and Africa on business and investment are infrequent . So to the extent that this distracts from that I think will be regretted all around . ''\n2 . Security challenges : Another potential barrier to U.S. investment in Africa : Growing extremism on the continent , which has overwhelmed certain governments .\nThe most flagrant example came earlier this summer , when the group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 school girls in Nigeria . The incident prompted international outrage and so far , a U.S.-backed team has not located them .\nNigeria-based Boko Haram opposes western-style education , and there are fears the group 's influence could be crossing borders .\nLast month , armed gunman suspected to be Boko Haram militants abducted the wife of Cameroon 's deputy prime minister .\nIntra-country sniping has followed . Nigeria has expressed frustration with Cameroon for not doing enough to fight Boko Haram on its side of the border , a charge Cameroon has denied .\nThe unrest has inflicted damage on African economies , including Nigeria 's , the largest on the continent . Other African nations combating violent extremism , like Mali , Kenya and Somalia , are also tough sells for U.S. investment .\nMany of those nations want more U.S. assistance to counter militants , sentiments likely to be expressed at this week 's summit .\n`` We are concerned about efforts by terrorist groups to gain a foothold in Africa , '' said Ben Rhodes , Obama 's deputy national security adviser .\nHe pointed to U.S. counterterror efforts that aim to partner with nations in stemming unrest .\n`` We 're looking at how do we get at the broader issue of countering violent extremism in Africa so that these groups , like Boko Haram , like al-Shabaab , like al-Qaeda , are not able to prey on young people with disinformation and intimidation , '' he said .\n3 . Countering China : The United States has some catching up to do in Africa when it comes to trade and investment .\nChina 's imports of African oil and natural minerals have skyrocketed over the past two decades . Alongside have come massive Chinese investments in African infrastructure and construction projects , manned by waves of Chinese workers who ended up remaining in Africa . More than a million Chinese citizens now live there .\n`` Africa is in a very particular moment , economically speaking , '' said French during an interview with CNNI from Nairobi . `` The continent has been growing very fast . Demographically , there 's a bulge in terms of it 's youth population . And Africa needs partnerships . ''\nObama wants to make sure the United States is one of those partners , and a more attractive one than China .\n`` My advice to African leaders is to make sure that if , in fact , China is putting in roads and bridges , number one , that they 're hiring African workers ; number two , that the roads do n't just lead from the mine to the port to Shanghai , but that there 's an ability for the African governments to shape how this infrastructure is going to benefit them in the long term , '' Obama told The Economist last week .\n4 . Cementing legacy : Obama 's two predecessors both secured legacy achievements in Africa -- Bill Clinton through his African Growth and Opportunity Act , and George W. Bush through his program combating HIV/AIDS .\nObama similarly hopes for a way to leave his mark on the continent after he leaves office , though his status as the first president of African descent has already made history .\nThat fact led some Africans to regard Obama with outsized expectations when he took office in 2009 , leading to some disappointment that he has n't focused more on shoring up U.S.-Africa ties .\nDuring his time in office , Obama has focused on terrorism , uprisings in the Arab world , Russian provocations , and the much-awaited pivot to Asia .\nObama made his first presidential trip to sub-Saharan Africa in 2009 when he visited Ghana . He did n't return again until 2013 with tour of Senegal , Tanzania and South Africa .\nHe 's embarked upon an initiative that aims to bring electricity to more Africans , and a program supporting young leaders working toward Democratic governments .\nBoth are elements to a legacy designed to shore up conditions for individuals on the continent .\nAnd the summit itself , while not expected to produce any large-scale trade agreements , is meant to signal a shift from purely humanitarian assistance to a two-way partnership .\n`` We believe it can be a game-changer in the U.S.-Africa relationship , '' Rhodes said of the summit .\n5 . Not invited : While the bulk of Africa 's leaders will be in Washington , the continent 's most reviled leaders wo n't be attending . They include Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe and Sudan 's Omar al-Bashir .\nThey were n't invited because of their alleged human rights abuses .\nOther controversial leaders -- like Kenya 's Uhuru Kenyatta , accused of crimes at the International Criminal Court -- will attend .\nLike any major diplomatic gathering , the Africa Leaders Summit has been an exercise in protocol and careful planning .\nInstead of meeting with leaders separately , Obama has been scheduled for larger group discussions , to the disappointment of some who wanted to talk to him one-on-one .\n`` We just would n't be able to do bilats with everybody , and so the simplest thing is for the President to devote his time to engaging broadly with all the leaders . That way we 're not singling out individuals at the expense of the other leaders , '' Rhodes said .\nHe noted Obama would speak with each leader individually during a dinner at the White House on Tuesday .\nThat event has taken on state dinner-type proportions , with a large tent constructed on the South Lawn . Organizers have the added stress of accommodating leaders of 50 nations , all with varied religious and cultural sensitivities that must be respected .\nFor example , servers must know who drinks alcohol and who abstains for religious reasons .\nIt 's a reflection of just how diverse Africa is , and how high the stakes are for Obama as he forges new relationships there .", "President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G-7 summit in Quebec , June 8 , 2018 . ( Leah Millis/Reuters )\nJustin Trudeau may be the annoying , youthful avatar of chic progressivism \u2014 but he \u2019 s not our adversary .\nAfter leaving the G-7 summit , President Donald Trump blasted the Canadian prime minister on Twitter as weak and dishonest , in the kind of invective once reserved for \u201c Little Rocket Man . \u201d\nThe Trump presidency routinely produces unprecedented events , and here is another : Never before has a president of the United States spoken as scornfully in public about the head of state of a friendly , allied country . Particularly one who has appeared in Vogue .\nTrudeau is not exactly a threatening figure , although his worshipful , celebrity-fueled press coverage qualifies as one of the more vexing political phenomena in all of North America ( Rolling Stone celebrated the fact that he rides a unicycle ; TMZ declared him on the \u201c clear path to hottest leader in the world \u201d ) .\nIt \u2019 s not clear what exactly led to the great U.S.\u2013Canada tiff of 2018 . White House aides fanned out over the weekend to try to lend meaning and justification to the flap .\nThey said Trudeau had stabbed the president in the back at the meeting . But Trudeau didn \u2019 t say anything after Trump left the G-7 that he hadn \u2019 t signaled before \u2014 namely that Canada finds Trump \u2019 s steel and aluminum tariffs insulting and will retaliate .\nThey said that Trudeau risked undermining the president \u2019 s position at his imminent summit in Singapore with Kim Jong-un . But the North Korea dictator is not recalibrating his diplomacy based on the statements of a leader of an inoffensive country half a world away .\nThe incident is a great misdirection . Canada \u2019 s trade practices are hardly above reproach . Its tariff on milk of 270 percent , highlighted by Trump officials the past few days , is stupid and indefensible . It is guilty of subsidizing and protecting favored companies and sectors , the way most countries are .\nIt is nothing compared with the world \u2019 s great mercantilist power , though . China routinely steals U.S. intellectual property , seeks to distort the entire system of international commerce to its advantage , and is pouring resources into a massive military buildup , with which it eventually hopes to expel the United States from East Asia .\nThat we are dissipating our energies with steel and aluminum tariffs against allies and potentially alienating friends speaks to a key mistake .\nTrudeau is the facile , democratically elected leader of a Western society ; President Xi Jinping is the remorseless president for life of a hostile dictatorship . It \u2019 s not a remotely close call who we should be aiming our fire at .\nThat we are dissipating our energies with steel and aluminum tariffs against allies and potentially alienating friends in what should be a united front against China speaks to a key mistake . Trump views the U.S. trade deficit \u2014 with any country , friend or foe \u2014 as the problem rather than China as the unique commercial and geostrategic competitor .\nOne of the advantages that the United States has in the long-term conflict with China is that we border peaceable , friendly countries . This is a blessing that shouldn \u2019 t be treated dismissively or recklessly .\nThe flare-up with Trudeau is not an encouraging sign for prospects of renegotiating NAFTA , which also should be viewed in strategic terms . As Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute points out , the trade agreement could extend beyond North America to Britain , which is seeking a new trade arrangement as it exits the EU , and the Philippines and Taiwan , which are pressured by China .\n\u201c A completed NAFTA 2.0 , \u201d Scissors writes , \u201c would provide the concrete foundation for rapid conclusion of comprehensive or partial trade agreements with these and other countries , while reassuring partners that the Trump administration is willing and able to move forward on trade if they are willing to meet some American demands . \u201d\nNone of this will happen if Trump is determined to pursue a protectionist policy no matter what , or he lets his pique at friends get the best of him . The trade war \u2014 and the fight for our paramount interests \u2014 won \u2019 t be won or lost against Justin Trudeau . Beijing , not Ottawa , is our enemy .", "Venezuela 's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says he has defeated an `` attempted coup '' by opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 .\nDozens of National Guardsmen sided with the opposition in clashes on Tuesday that injured more than 100 people .\nBut in a defiant TV address , President Maduro said Mr Guaid\u00f3 had failed to turn the military against him .\nMr Guaid\u00f3 insists that Mr Maduro has lost control of the armed forces . The opposition leader called for more streets protests on Wednesday .\n`` Today we continue , '' he tweeted . `` We will keep going with more strength than ever , Venezuela . ''\nMr Guaid\u00f3 has been recognised as interim leader of Venezuela by more than 50 countries , including the US , the UK and most in Latin America .\nThe US reiterated its support for Mr Guaid\u00f3 on Wednesday , with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying `` military action is possible '' if necessary .\nBut Mr Maduro , backed by Russia , China and the top of the country 's military , has refused to cede leadership to his rival .\nMr Pompeo is scheduled to speak with Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday , National Security Adviser John Bolton said .\nIn his televised address , flanked by military commanders , Mr Maduro accused protesters of `` serious crimes '' which he said would `` not go unpunished '' .\nBoth the president and Mr Guaid\u00f3 have called on their supporters to take to the streets , setting up more potential violent unrest in a nation already beset by economic crisis , chronic power cuts and widespread food shortages .\nMr Maduro lashed out again at the United States , which he accuses of plotting against him . He dismissed a claim by the US that he had a plane ready on the tarmac to take him to Cuba , a staunch supporter of the beleaguered president .\n`` They had an airplane on the tarmac , '' Mr Pompeo said . `` He was ready to leave this morning [ Tuesday ] , as we understand it . Russians indicated he should stay . ''\nA three-minute video by Mr Guaid\u00f3 published in the early hours of Tuesday showed him standing alongside a number of men in military uniform . He announced that he had the support of `` brave soldiers '' in the capital , Caracas .\nHe urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets , and appeared alongside another opposition leader , Leopoldo L\u00f3pez , who had been under house arrest since 2014 .\nSupporters on both sides then gathered in different places of Caracas throughout the day , and there were clashes between Mr Guaid\u00f3 's supporters and armed military vehicles .\nProtesters were also seen throwing rocks , but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon . At one stage a military vehicle was filmed driving into protesters .\nMr Guaid\u00f3 , the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly , has called on Venezuela 's military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president in January .\nHe argues that President Maduro is a `` usurper '' because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed .\nTuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis this year . Venezuelan health officials said 69 people were injured in the clashes , including two with bullet wounds .\nBroadcasts from a number of news agencies , including the BBC and CNN , were apparently suspended amid the violence .\nLater on Tuesday , it emerged Mr L\u00f3pez had sought safety in the Chilean , then the Spanish embassy , along with his family .\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) issued an emergency prohibition against all US carriers flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace .\nIt also said all US operators should leave the country within 48 hours , due to increasing political instability .\nOne sidebar to the Venezuela story is the battle for influence between the US and Russia . It 's a battle that , for now at least , Russia seems to be winning .\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quick to accuse Russia of meddling , insisting that its government had persuaded President Maduro to abandon plans to flee to Havana .\nWhile the US has firmly backed the Venezuelan opposition leader Russia has thrown its weight behind Mr Maduro - vetoing a US resolution calling for fresh Venezuelan elections and offering considerable practical assistance - medicines , grain supplies and unspecified military support .\nRussia 's support for Venezuela has been long-standing . And it 's not just a matter of strategic rivalry with Washington , corporate interests in Moscow and individuals close to President Putin have large stakes in Venezuela 's oil industry .\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence .\nThe US reiterated its support for Mr Guaid\u00f3 . In a television interview on Wednesday , Mr Pompeo said Washington would prefer a peaceful transition of power but stated that `` military action is possible '' .\n`` If that 's what 's required , that 's what the United States will do , '' the US Secretary of State said .\nPresident Donald Trump said he was monitoring events in Venezuela `` very closely '' and said the US stood with the Venezuelan people and their freedom .\nHe also threatened to implement the `` highest-level sanctions '' and a `` full and complete embargo '' against Cuba unless its military immediately ceased its support of Mr Maduro .\nGovernments who still support Mr Maduro , including Bolivia and Cuba , condemned Mr Guaid\u00f3 's efforts as an attempted `` coup d'etat '' .\nThe Mexican government expressed `` concern about a possible increase in violence '' while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand `` on the right side of history '' against Mr Maduro .\nAn emergency meeting of the Lima Group of Latin American countries has been scheduled for Friday .", "When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that he would visit Pearl Harbor , meeting President Obama in Hawaii Tuesday , it was noteworthy that both leaders characterized the visit as an opportunity for reconciliation .\nThe United States and Japan , after all , would seem to have reconciled long ago . The two nations have made peace and become close allies since the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 75 years ago and the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima four years later .\nBut the two leaders ' message is clear . What the Obama-Abe visit will demonstrate is that reconciliation is not a one-and-done , but is a perpetual work in progress between onetime adversaries \u2013 even after decades of close relations . Coming seven months after Mr. Obama \u2019 s groundbreaking visit to Hiroshima , Mr. Abe \u2019 s Pearl Harbor trip is yet another step beyond a declaration made decades ago .\n\u201c To some extent , these two events \u2026 are the last remaining hurdles in the process of reconciliation , \u201d says James Schoff , a senior fellow and expert in US-Japan relations at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . \u201c This is taking us a greater distance down this road \u2013 and it \u2019 s a long road . \u201d\nDemonstrating the power of reconciliation can be an important example for other relationships , some diplomatic experts say . The progress of the US-Japan relationship shows it can only happen after leaders and the people behind them grasp how reconciliation is not simply a nicety but crucially in their self-interest , some experts say .\nThat motivation may help explain Abe \u2019 s initiative to visit Pearl Harbor , where a surprise Japanese attack killed more than 2,400 American service members and civilians . It was originally announced that he would be the first sitting Japanese leader to visit the site , but as many as three Japanese prime ministers apparently visited Pearl Harbor with less fanfare in the 1950s . Abe is the first to visit with a US president .\n\u201c Abe \u2019 s plan and policy is to ensure that as much as he can personally , he closes the book on World War II \u2013 because Japan faces a worrisome future in a very unstable region , \u201d says Michael Auslin , director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington . \u201c By visiting Pearl Harbor I think he \u2019 s saying , \u2018 We no longer shirk responsibility for the past , but we do so in part because we \u2019 re concerned about preserving this unique relationship [ with the US ] to deal with our current challenges . \u2019 \u201d\nAbe isn \u2019 t taking the first step in what might be considered the ultimate US-Japan reconciliation dance . In May , Obama became the first American president to visit Hiroshima , the Japanese city where the US first used the atomic bomb . ( The second and last time was three days later on the city of Nagasaki , forcing Japan \u2019 s surrender . )\nAbe \u2019 s visit to Pearl Harbor \u201c makes a fitting counterpoint to [ Obama \u2019 s Hiroshima ] trip , marking the alpha and omega of World War II in the Pacific , \u201d says Bruce Klingner , a senior research fellow in Northeast Asian issues at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .\nBy commemorating the two terrible events that opened and closed the horrendous Second World War between their countries , the two leaders are underscoring how the US and Japan have been able to \u201c overcome the animosity of conflict to become enduring partners and allies , \u201d Mr. Klingner wrote in a recent commentary on the Heritage website .\nComing to terms with their intertwined history and onetime adversarial past has allowed the two countries to build a partnership that is now a \u201c symbol of what democracies can achieve together , \u201d he says .\nThat the two leaders are only now visiting the two iconic sites offers some measure of how fraught such symbolic gestures can be .\nFirst , the US had some misgivings about an Abe visit to Pearl Harbor so soon after Obama \u2019 s trip to Hiroshima because there were concerns it would look like a \u201c quid pro quo , \u201d Mr. Schoff says \u2013 or that it would establish some unwanted equivalency between the two events .\n\u201c Even though the US and Japan have been solid allies for more than a half century , the two sides have remained divided about the tragedies of the beginning and the end of the war , \u201d says Dr. Auslin . \u201c They may never see fully eye-to-eye on the two events , but with these two visits together they are putting aside whatever differences remain to focus on how much stronger the two countries are together . \u201d\nAbe \u2019 s visit to Pearl Harbor is particularly important as a \u201c message \u201d not just to Americans but to Japan \u2019 s neighbors \u2013 chief among them South Korea \u2013 who were the victims of imperial Japan \u2019 s violent expansion across the region , says Auslin , author of \u201c The End of the Asian Century . \u201d\nAbe has made reconciliation with South Korea a goal of his tenure . A year ago , the Japanese leader and South Korean President Park Geun-hye sealed an agreement that begins to address the wrenching issues left by Japan \u2019 s more than three decades of occupation of the Korean Peninsula .\nPart of that agreement was reparations for \u201c comfort women \u201d the Japanese military seized during occupation \u2013 a couple hundred of whom remain alive today . Several of Abe \u2019 s predecessors considered the issue settled and behind the two countries , but clearly South Korea did not .\nBy going further than previous Japanese leaders , Abe was not just acknowledging past mistakes but recognizing the overriding interest both countries have in getting beyond their past , Auslin says .\nBut some say Japan and its neighbors \u2013 particularly South Korea and China \u2013 have much further to go on the path to reconciliation .\n\u201c If anything , I \u2019 d say the whole question of Japan \u2019 s occupation and wartime activities has become a bigger issue as these Asian countries have grown and prospered , \u201d says Schoff . \u201c Their rising status has made them much more vocal on these issues. \u201c\nPerhaps the crucial factor that sets the US-Japan reconciliation apart , Schoff says , is that , during the \u201c process \u201d of walking the path together , the two countries have become friends .\n\u201c When they begin to express sympathy for each other \u2019 s misfortune , that \u2019 s when you see that there \u2019 s an element of understanding that has been picked up on this path of reconciliation , \u201d he says .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nReferring to Abe \u2019 s statement that he hoped to send \u201c messages \u201d with his Pearl Harbor visit , Schoff says , \u201c There \u2019 s a message of friendship in these expressions of sympathy and understanding . \u201d", "Both the nuclear production and the attacks on tankers underscore the way Trump \u2019 s retreat from diplomacy has made the world more perilous . But they both are measured provocations : If you want to damage a tanker , you put the limpet mine below the water line rather than above it , and Iran \u2019 s violations of the Iran pact won \u2019 t put it close to a bomb soon .\nTrump described the damage to the tankers as \u201c very minor , \u201d and he seems to recognize the danger of escalation . But he has sent an additional 2,500 U.S. troops to the region , and there have been calls for striking Iran . If the U.S. does , then of course Iran will respond .\nBrett McGurk , a national security expert and former presidential envoy , warned that given the failure of the administration \u2019 s Iran policy so far , \u201c Trump may soon be boxed in : Either back down or resort to military tools . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s troubling that the administration is also conflating Shiite Iran with the Sunni Taliban . Members of Congress fear that this is meant to give Trump legal cover to attack Iran under the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against Al Qaeda and its offshoots .\nReflecting the administration \u2019 s propensity to inhabit a fantasyland , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has offered a ridiculous 12-point plan that essentially called for Iran to roll over and surrender .\nI was in Paris over the weekend for the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission , and it \u2019 s sad to see how distrustful our allies have become toward America . Instead of forcing Iran into submission , Washington \u2019 s incompetent bullying of Europe and Asia to join Iran sanctions has managed to antagonize our oldest friends , push Iran back toward a nuclear path and increase the risk of war .\nThere are few good options now , but an international force to protect tankers might help , along with secret diplomacy to see if the nuclear deal can be patched up in a way that both sides can accept . I doubt it , but it \u2019 s worth trying .", "Ukraine 's acting government issued an arrest warrant Monday for President Viktor Yanukovych , accusing him of mass crimes against the protesters who stood up for months against his rule . Russia sharply questioned its authority , calling it an `` armed mutiny . ''\nYanukovych has reportedly fled to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea , a pro-Russian area in Ukraine . His exact whereabouts are unknown .\nCalls are mounting in Ukraine to put Yanukovych on trial , after a tumultuous presidency in which he amassed powers , enriched his allies and family and cracked down on protesters . Anger boiled over last week after government snipers killed scores of protesters in the bloodiest violence in Ukraine 's post-Soviet history .\nYanukovych \u2018 s departure came hours after signing an agreement on resolving Ukraine 's political crisis that reduced his powers and was seen by many as a tacit admission of defeat . He apparently fled Ukraine 's capital by car and aircraft , heading for the parts of the country where he is most likely to find friends , according to the acting head of the police .\nThe turmoil has turned this strategically located country of 46 million inside out over the past few days . The parliament speaker is now nominally in charge of a country whose ailing economy is on the brink of default and whose loyalties are sharply torn between Europe and longtime ruler Russia .\nRussia and the European Union appeared to be taking opposing sides in Ukraine 's new political landscape .\nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev questioned the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian authorities on Monday . According to Russian news agencies , he said the acting authorities have come to power as a result of an `` armed mutiny , '' so their legitimacy is causing `` big doubts . ''\nIn Brussels , European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly referred to parliament speaker Oleksandr Turchinov as the `` interim president '' and said Turchinov will meet with Monday visiting EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Kiev .\nTurchinov said he hopes to form a new coalition government by Tuesday .\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the U.S. is prepared to provide financial support to Ukraine at this crucial time .\n`` The United States , working with partners around the world , stands ready to provide support for Ukraine as it takes the reforms it needs to , to get back to economic stability , '' Carney said .\n`` This support can complement an IMF program by helping to make reforms easier and by putting Ukraine in a position to invest more in health and education to help develop Ukraine 's human capital and strengthen its social safety net , '' Carney added .\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is facing a huge challenge in how to respond to the turmoil in Ukraine , a country he has declared vital for Russia 's interests , which is home to millions of Russian-speakers and hosts a major Russian navy base .\nSome in Ukraine 's Russian-speaking east and south already have begged the Kremlin to help protect them against what they fear could be violence by the victorious protesters who toppled Ukraine 's Moscow-backed leader . Putin has refrained from taking a public stance on Ukraine amid the Sochi Games , but the mounting tensions could quickly leave him with a stark choice : Stick to diplomacy and risk losing face at home , or open a Pandora 's box by entering the fray .\nIf Moscow openly backs separatist-minded groups in Ukraine 's Crimean Peninsula that serves as the base for Russia 's Black Sea Fleet , it could unleash devastating hostilities that Europe has n't seen since the Balkan wars . And ignoring pleas for help from pro-Russian groups in Ukraine could shatter Putin 's carefully manicured image of the tough ruler eager to stand up to the West , eroding his conservative support base at home , where his foes could be encouraged by the Ukrainian example .\nFacing such high risks , Putin has remained silent , weighing his options .\nPutin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone Sunday and the German government said the two agreed that Ukraine 's `` territorial integrity must be respected . ''\nOn Monday , German government spokesman Steffan Seibert told reporters that Ukraine 's new leaders should consider the interests of the south and east -- the pro-Russian sections of Ukraine -- in the composition of a new government . He also said the offer of an association agreement with the EU is still on the table .\nMeanwhile , Ukraine 's acting interior minister , Arsen Avakhov , said on his official Facebook page that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Yanukovych and several other officials for the `` mass killing of civilians . ''\nAt least 82 people , primarily protesters , were killed in clashes in Kiev last week .\nYanukovych set off a wave of protests by shelving an agreement with the European Union in November and turning instead for a $ 15 billion bailout loan from Russia . Within weeks , the protests expanded to include outrage over corruption and human rights abuses , leading to calls for Yanukovych 's resignation .\nAfter signing an agreement Friday with the opposition to form a unity government , Yanukovych fled Kiev for his pro-Russian power base in eastern Ukraine . Avakhov said he tried to fly out of Donetsk but was stopped then went to Crimea on Sunday .\nYanukovych then freed his official security detail and drove off to an unknown location , turning off all forms of communication , Avakhov said .\nSecurity has been tightened across Ukraine 's borders , the Interfax news agency quoted the State Border Guard service as saying .\nAvakhov published a letter that he said was from Yanukovych , dated Monday , in which he gave up his security guard . Yanukovych 's aides and spokespeople could not be reached Monday to verify the reported letter -- they have been rapidly distancing themselves from him as his hold on power disintegrates .\nActivist Valeri Kazachenko said Yanukovych must be arrested and brought to Kiev 's main square for trial .\n`` He must answer for all the crimes he has committed against Ukraine and its people , '' Kazachenko said .\nTensions have been mounting in Crimea in southern Ukraine . Russia maintains a large naval base in Sevastopol that has strained relations between the countries for two decades .\nPro-Russian protesters gathered in front of city hall in the port of Sevastopol on Monday chanting `` Russia ! Russia ! ''\n`` Extremists have seized power in Kiev and we must defend Crimea . Russia must help us with that , '' said Anataly Mareta , head of a Cossack militia in Sevastopol .\nThe head of the city administration in Sevastopol quit Monday amid the turmoil , and protesters replaced a Ukrainian flag near the city hall building with a Russian flag .\nAs president , Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate power and wealth , curb free speech and oversee the imprisonment of his top political rival , former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko . But as protesters took control of the capital over the weekend , many allies turned against him .\nTymoshenko , the blond-braided heroine of the 2004 Orange Revolution , is back on the political scene after having been freed from prison .\nThe current protest movement in Ukraine has been in large part a fight for the country 's economic future -- for better jobs and prosperity .\nUkraine has a large potential consumer market , an educated workforce , a significant industrial base and good natural resources , in particular rich farmland . Yet its economy is in tatters .\nUkraine has struggled with corruption , bad government and short-sighted reliance on cheap gas from Russia . Political unrest has pushed up the deficit , sent the currency skidding and may have pushed the economy back into a recession .", "On the morning of Aug. 30 , 2019 , as Hurricane Dorian was bearing down on Florida 's Treasure Coast , Jamie Seiler was at the hospital where she worked , preparing for the storm 's approach . Then her cellphone rang .\nOn the other end was the principal of her son 's school . The principal said her son had been escorted out of the school in handcuffs and was being taken to a psychiatric hospital in a police car .\nGetting such a call is a nightmare for any parent , but Seiler 's son had n't threatened to shoot up the school or commit suicide . He had several developmental disorders and had thrown a tantrum . He was just 9 years old .\n`` I flipped out , I broke down , '' Seiler says . She sat in her boss 's office , `` hysterical to the point they did n't think that I would be able to drive . ''\nA professional therapist would later tell Seiler that a school resource officer ( SRO ) had tackled her autistic 80-pound son while he was sitting on a bench\u2014a use of force that the therapist , who was in the room at the time , said was unnecessary . One teacher who was present cried , according to an incident report filed by the therapist .\nSeiler 's son Evan is only one of thousands of small children who are led out of schools in handcuffs every year around the country . Juvenile arrests in Florida have been steadily declining over the last decade , as they have been more generally across the U.S. , but for the next few years the state will be a bellwether for school safety and juvenile justice .\nAfter the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , the state embarked on an aggressive plan to `` harden '' its schools against shooting threats , including putting at least one SRO or armed guardian in every K-12 school in the state . However , civil liberties groups , disability rights advocates , and lawyers for parents say the state overcorrected , and that students , especially minorities and those with disabilities , are now bearing the brunt of new zero tolerance policies and heavy-handed discipline . As arrests of small children make national headlines , and legislators and parents debate how far is too far when it comes to school safety , Florida 's schools have become a high-stakes experiment in policing .\nAmid a nationwide debate on law enforcement violence following the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor , school resource officers have flown somewhat under the radar . But it 's clear that education officials are already rethinking police presence in classrooms : In Minneapolis , where Floyd was killed after an officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes , the school board recently voted in favor of a resolution ending a $ 1 million partnership with city police . Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland , Oregon , announced last week that he would disband the city 's school resource officers , putting a million dollars from the SRO budget toward counselors , social workers , and `` culturally specific partnerships . '' Other states and cities appear to be considering similar measures .\nIn Florida , the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) warned in a report last June that the new laws could reverse years of progress in reducing school arrests . While juvenile arrests both in and out of Florida schools continued to fall in the 2017\u20132018 fiscal year , according to state law enforcement data , `` the percentage of youth arrests for misdemeanors that occurred at schools , rather than in the community , increased to 20 % , the first increase in a decade , '' the Florida ACLU wrote .\nMeanwhile , attorneys , disability rights advocates , and media investigations say that there 's been a spike in the use of involuntary psychiatric commitments against kids like Evan , thanks to an existing Florida mental health law that gives police authority to temporarily lock up both children and adults against their will . Shahar Pasch is a Florida attorney who represents children with disabilities and their parents , including Seiler .\n`` Since Parkland , it 's gone through the roof , '' Pasch says . `` I had another young , elementary-aged kid who was handcuffed and hobbled , which means his legs were tied together . ''\nLast year , an SRO in Orlando , Florida sparked public outrage after he arrested a 6-year-old girl , Kaia Rolle , for misdemeanor battery . A small child , handcuffed and arrested , booked and given a mugshot ? The arrest made national news and led to the officer 's firing . It was n't an isolated incident , though . Stories like that pop up every few years . In 2006 , it was a St. Petersburg 5-year-old who was handcuffed and arrested in school .\nABC News reported that , according to FBI crime data , 30,467 children under the age of 10 were arrested in the United States between 2013 and 2018 . During the same period , 266,000 children between the ages of 10 and 12 were arrested .\nThe good news is that the rate of juvenile arrests in the U.S. has dropped significantly since its peak in 1996 , from roughly 8,500 arrests per 100,000 individuals between the ages of 10 and 17 to 2,400 in 2016 . This mirrors the nationwide trend of declining crime throughout the 2000s and 2010s .\nBut in most places , there is no minimum age at which a child can be arrested and charged with a crime\u201434 states have no lower age limit for delinquency , while 11 states place the floor at 10 years old .\nAccording to data from the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice , Florida police arrested 2,781 children between the ages of 5 and 12 in fiscal year 2018\u20132019 , the latest year for which data are available . The youngest was a 5-year-old Hispanic boy . He was charged by the Osceola County Sheriff 's Office with felony aggravated assault . The data were anonymized , though , and \u2588\u2588\u2588 could not obtain more information about the case from the sheriff 's office .\nIn an effort to see how common allegations of excessive force like Seiler 's are against the approximately 1,800 SROs in Florida , and whether those complaints are substantiated by police departments , \u2588\u2588\u2588 filed public records requests for a decade 's worth of disciplinary records against SROs in numerous Florida counties , including Palm Beach .\nIn most cases , sheriff 's departments charged several hundred dollars for the records . However , the Palm Beach Public School District responded with an estimated fee invoice for $ 20,060 to complete the request .\nOther large agencies , like the Broward Sheriff 's Office and the Orlando Police Department , rejected the requests because they do n't track SROs separately in their systems .\nPasco County , however , a rural-suburban county of about 550,000 people north of Tampa Bay , is illustrative of some of the concerns that civil liberties groups have about expanding police presence in schools .\nIn December , a Pasco deputy threatened to shoot a high school student who was attempting to leave the campus in his car . The deputy and a school staffer had blocked the student from leaving , leading to a long standoff between both parties .\n`` You 're gon na get shot you come another fucking foot closer to me , '' the deputy says at one point as the student tries to maneuver around him . `` You run into me , you 'll get fucking shot . ''\nThe student 's mother , who obtained body camera footage of the exchange , said her son had an orthodontist appointment that she 'd notified the school of weeks in advance .\nLast October , an SRO in the county was fired after he accidentally fired his gun in a middle school cafeteria . According to Pasco Sheriff 's Office disciplinary records , `` Video surveillance captured him mishandling his agency issued firearm , which caused an accidental discharge . The projective entered and exited his uniform pants leg and struck the wall behind him ; bullet fragments were located on the ground adjacent to the lunch line where students were standing at the time of the discharge . ''\nThe Pasco Sheriff 's Office terminated another SRO , Milton Arroyo , in 2017 after an investigation found he was sending inappropriate text messages to several female students at the high school he patrolled . He was technically fired for a different offense , however : misusing a Florida state law enforcement database to search for confidential information on women he was interested in .\nLocal news outlets and the public did n't know , though , that several months before Arroyo was fired , the Pasco Sheriff 's Office reprimanded him after he was caught on camera flipping someone off in the school cafeteria . Several parents filed a complaint against him , according to a disciplinary report .\nThe office reprimanded another Pasco SRO in 2019 after he physically restrained a student but failed to turn on his body camera or file an incident report .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 also obtained disciplinary records from Miami-Dade Schools Police Department . In 2014 , officer Juan Cecchinelli was removed from his position after he sent sexually explicit texts to a teenage girl at the school he policed . An internal affairs summary notes that , during the department 's investigation , Cecchinelli `` refused to answer why he had sex toys in his department assigned vehicle . ''\nOther incidents have popped up around the state . In February , a Miami-Dade Schools officer was caught on camera cursing at and threatening to shoot high school students . She has been placed on administrative leave while the department investigates .\nLast November , an Orange County SRO was fired after video emerged of him pulling a middle school student 's hair . That same month , a Broward County sheriff 's deputy was arrested and charged with child abuse after video showed him body-slamming a 15-year-old girl at a school for children with special needs .\nIn March 2019 , Duval County School Police ( DCSP ) fired an SRO after video showed him grabbing a high school girl by the neck and throwing her to the ground . According to public records obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , three other DCSP members resigned in 2019 for `` unbecoming conduct , '' `` failure to write a report , '' and `` actions or which may bring the DCSP into disrepute or ridicule . '' One of them pointed a fake gun at a student with special needs . Three other DCSP members resigned in 2018 after one pawned his service weapon and the other two failed to report it .\nIt 's notable that in most of these incidents the officers were fired . Departments appear to have little stomach for such cases .\nAlthough the Florida Department of Law Enforcement keeps records on decertified police officers , it does not track officers by role , so it 's unknown how many SROs have had their law enforcement license revoked over the years . However , using a USA Today database of decertified police officers , \u2588\u2588\u2588 identified 18 officers from Florida departments that exclusively police schools , such as the Miami-Dade Schools Police . They were decertified for offenses including cocaine possession , witness-dissuading , perjury , aggravated assault , and sexual harassment . In 2007 , a Palm Beach School District police officer was arrested and decertified for allegedly handcuffing and sexually assaulting a woman .\n`` If You 're Going To Act Like a Fool , I 'm Going To Treat You Like a Fool . ''\nIn many ways , Evan is a typical 9-year-old boy . He likes riding his BMX bike , swimming , and surfing , and he has a menagerie of pets\u2014four cats , a guinea pig , and three fish . Seiler says that if you passed her son on the street , the only thing you would notice about him would be his bright red hair .\nBut Evan is also on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum . He 's been diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , and dyslexia .\nEvan attended Acreage Pines Elementary School , a public school in Palm Beach County , where he was in a classroom specifically for children with autism . Seiler also paid a private applied behavior analysis ( ABA ) therapist to work with Evan 20 hours a week , including at school .\nOn August 30 of last year , Evan had a meltdown at school . He began throwing items and ripping up his schoolwork .\nJennifer Borr , a South Florida ABA specialist , says ABA therapists work to reinforce good behavior and decision making skills with young children .\nBorr says children on the autism spectrum often have trouble communicating and struggle with what 's called `` executive function skills '' \u2014things like regulating emotions and dealing with changes in routines . They 're also often sensitive to sensory stimuli like noises , lights , and touch .\nThis combination can lead to behavior seen as aggressive or dangerous by others , such as `` stimming '' \u2014repetitive movements like banging their head\u2014or acting out and hitting other people . However , Sam Crane , legal director for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network , says the behavior , especially when physical boundaries are broached , is perfectly logical from the student 's point of view .\n`` A student might try to leave a classroom if it 's overstimulating , '' she says . `` The teacher might block them . The student panics and tries to push past the teacher , and then that 's seen as an assault or something along those lines . ''\nEvan 's ABA therapist took him outside the classroom , and eventually to the office , where the therapist and the school behavior counselor tried to calm him down .\nIn an internal company report filed after the incident , the therapist wrote that Evan `` punched me in the chest and kicked me in the shin , threw chairs , [ and ] then sat down on green couch after [ being ] placed in a 'bear hug . ' ''\nAt this point , Evan was sitting on a couch , and his tantrum was waning , according to the therapist . `` Heavy breathing is an indicator of cooling down , '' the report notes . School administrators were discussing filing a report on Evan 's physical outburst toward the therapist when things abruptly escalated .\nAccording to the ABA therapist 's report , an SRO `` tackled Evan to the ground and stated , 'If you are going to act like a fool I am going to treat you like a fool ' and then said 'you are coming with me ' while holding handcuffs , trying to place them around Evan 's wrists . ''\nThe incident report says a teacher in the room `` started to cry when Evan was brought to the ground by the officer , and she started to cover her face by holding a piece of paper while stating ' I do n't understand why they are doing this . ' ''\nPalm Beach County School District policies , as laid out in a `` Baker Act decision tree protocol , '' require that a student having a mental health crisis `` remains in crisis and continues to exhibit behaviors which potentially meet Baker Act criteria '' before escalating the situation further .\n`` I feel that the way the officer dealt with this situation was unnecessary because the tantrum behavior had ceased and was under control , '' the therapist concluded .\nFlorida law enforcement arrested 8,153 students at K-12 schools in the 2018\u20132019 school year , according to state data , a small increase over the previous year .\nAlthough Evan was led out of school in handcuffs and placed in the back of a police cruiser , his case would not appear in any state data on juvenile arrests , because rather than arrest him , the SRO attempted to involuntarily commit him to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation .\nEvan was detained under the Florida Health Act of 1971 , commonly called the Baker Act . Under the law , a judge , doctor , or police officer can commit someone to an involuntary psychiatric evaluation for up to 72 hours .\nUse of the Baker Act is common enough that , over the decades , the name has also become a verb\u2014as in , to Baker Act someone , or get Baker Acted . Disability rights advocates allege use of the Baker Act against children has spiked since the Parkland shooting .\n`` We noticed that we 're getting a lot more calls from families of children who 've been Baker Acted at school , '' says Ann Siegel , an attorney with Disability Rights Florida .\nSiegel and other advocates also say that , crucially , parents are n't being given the opportunity to intervene before their children are removed from school .\n`` The parent is not called , '' Siegel says . `` If you look at the Baker Act statute , there 's a provision in there where you 're supposed to see if family intervention is a possibility . ''\nThe Baker Act statute authorizes police to commit someone when their mental state makes them a threat to themselves or others . It also includes the clause , `` and it is not apparent that such harm may be avoided through the help of willing family members or friends or the provision of other services . ''\nPalm Beach County School District 's protocols also recommend that schools `` make every effort to include the parents/guardians in all phases of the process . ''\nBut Seiler says she was n't contacted by Evan 's school until her son was already en route to a hospital . When the SRO finally called her , Seiler says he initially would n't say where he was taking her son and told her not to come , since she would n't be able to see him anyway .\nWhen Florida resident William Terry 's autistic 11-year-old son was Baker Acted after hitting a teacher at Boca Raton Community Middle School while having a meltdown , Terry says his wife showed up at the school minutes after she was called but was not allowed to see her child .\n`` My wife , as you can imagine with a special needs kid , has got a very special bond with him , and she can usually calm him down , '' Terry says . `` All of his teachers know that , but they separated her from him . ''\nInstead , Terry 's son was handcuffed , sent to a hospital , and held for psychiatric evaluation for the full 72 hours allowed under the law . Terry says he and his wife were only allowed to visit their son for an hour a day during that time .\nIn March , school officials at Belcher Elementary School in Clearwater , Florida , called Tyeisha Harmon to tell her that her 7-year-old son , who has ADHD and a mental health disorder , was having a meltdown . He 'd walked out into the parking lot after being moved into a new classroom\u2014a change in routine that upset him .\n`` It took me about 20 minutes to get there , '' Harmon says . `` When I got there , I asked for my son , and they told me that he had been taken away about 15 minutes prior . ''\nHarmon says the SRO called her while she was en route to the hospital . When Harmon asked the officer why she 'd Baker Acted the boy , the officer said that he had scratched her , and that her only options were to either charge him with a crime or commit him .\nHarmon says her son was handcuffed so tightly that it left marks on his wrists that were still visible when she got him out of the psychiatric hospital four hours later .\n`` Part of the Baker Act says that a person has to be a danger to himself and others , '' Harmon says . `` My son was in a parking lot with a police officer and adults . What harm could he really do to call for a Baker Act ? ''\nAs for the rise in the number of Baker Act commitments , data back up what lawyers and advocates are seeing anecdotally . A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that children had been removed from Tampa-area schools via the Baker Act more than 7,500 times over the past seven years . A database built by the Times showed that the rate of commitments for local students rose 35 percent in just the last five years . Overall , the investigation found `` glaring weaknesses in the system\u2014from a lack of parental consent , to students being wrongly committed , to facilities that put students in harm 's way . ''\nThe Times found cases like a sixth grader who was Baker Acted for joking to his friends , `` Oh look , ropes . Time to hang myself . '' Or a 13-year-old girl who was Baker Acted by an SRO for telling her friend she had argued with her mother and wanted to throw herself off the school bus .\nIn February , a 6-year-old girl in Duval County was Baker Acted after allegedly destroying school property and attacking staff . The girl has been previously diagnosed with a disruptive mood disorder . Her family claims she was injected with the antipsychotic drug Thorazine while committed .\nA similar investigation last year by the Ft. Myers News-Press reported that there were a record 32,763 Baker Act commitments of children in 2017 . About a quarter of those were removals from schools , according to a Florida Department of Children and Families report .\nThe data are incomplete , though . Unlike juvenile arrests , it 's unknown exactly how many Florida children are committed through the Baker Act because of disturbances at schools . `` The problem with [ the ] Baker Act is the schools do n't have to report those numbers , '' Seigel says . `` They do n't even keep track of them . ''\nA Florida state legislator introduced a bill in January that would require schools to accurately report Baker Act commitments and require parents to be notified prior to a child 's removal .\nThe data that are available , though , suggest that while school arrests in Florida have been trending down , administrators and law enforcement are in many cases just substituting one mechanism for removing a child from school for another .\n`` Autistic kids are facing widespread problems with schools that are trying to find ways to segregate them and deny them the educational services that they 're entitled to , '' says Crane .\nSeiler finally arrived at the Palm Beach hospital where Evan had been taken . She says he was sitting quietly and repeating , `` I want to go home . ''\nSeiler says a psychiatrist came and talked to Evan for a few minutes about cars\u2014another of Evan 's interests\u2014and concluded that he was just having a bad day . Evan was released back to his mother , and Seiler was charged a $ 250 copay for the involuntary emergency room visit .\nTerry says he received a hospital bill for $ 5,000 for his son 's three-day commitment .\nWhy a police officer would tackle and handcuff a third grader is one question . Another question is why the officer was in the school in the first place .\nPolice have been in American schools since the 1950s , but never with the frequency that they are now . Armed police officers were in just 1 percent of public schools in the 1970s , according to The Trace , a nonprofit newsroom that covers firearms . Federal data show that by the 2015\u201316 school year they were in 43 percent of all public schools and 71 percent of high schools .\nNational Association of School Resource Officers ( NASRO ) executive director Mo Canady says being an SRO is `` the most unique assignment in law enforcement . ''\n`` Officers that are going to be assigned in this particular field have got to be carefully selected , '' Canady says . `` It 's not for every officer . As a matter of fact , I might argue it 's not for most officers . ''\nThe number of SROs in Florida has dramatically increased over the past two years , following the passage of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act in 2018 .\nThe new law requires at least one police officer or armed guardian in every public elementary , middle , and high school in Florida . Most districts have opted for police , which has led to an expensive hiring rush for qualified officers in school districts across the state .\nThere are no national certification requirements for SROs . Standards vary from state to state , although NASRO offers best practices and training . Several states , such as Pennsylvania , require prospective officers to go through NASRO 's training .\nIn Florida , potential SROs are required to undergo a criminal background check , drug testing , and a psychological evaluation , in addition to being a state-certified law enforcement officer . The state 's attorney general 's office and several other organizations offer SRO training classes , starting at a basic 40-hour course , but there is no statute or state-level rule regarding SRO certification . The level of required training is left to individual police departments .\nThe police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota has intensified scrutiny of police hiring and qualification standards , and some districts are reconsidering their use of SROs entirely . HuffPost reported that , in addition to the Minneapolis school board severing its relationship with the city 's police department , a school board member in Denver plans on introducing a similar resolution , and officials are considering similar plans in `` Arizona , North Carolina , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Washington , Oregon , New York , and Illinois . '' A HuffPost investigation last year found that children have been tasered by SROs in at least 143 incidents since 2011 .\nSROs do n't write the laws , though . Throughout the 1980s and '90s , zero tolerance policies spread through schools across the country\u2014first in response to drugs , then mass shootings\u2014and Florida passed some of the harshest laws in the country .\nAfter the passage of the federal Gun-Free School Act of 1994 , Florida required all school districts to enforce zero tolerance policies for students who bring weapons to school , requiring students who violate the policy to be expelled for at least a year or referred to law enforcement . In 2000 , the state legislature passed another package of juvenile justice bills , known as the `` tough love '' plan , that further reinforced this punitive model . School districts began to expand the scope of their zero tolerance policies beyond drugs and guns to petty misbehavior . While juvenile arrest rates in general were falling in the state\u2014mirroring a nationwide drop\u2014there were persistent and troubling racial disparities in school discipline and arrests , not to mention kids being charged with battery for shooting spitballs , or being expelled for bringing nail clippers to school , or dying at a military-style juvenile boot camp .\nAfter a decade , Florida lawmakers reconsidered the wisdom of using the criminal justice system to dispense love . In 2009 , the state legislature loosened those zero tolerance policies , amending the statutes to clarify that they `` are not intended to be rigorously applied to petty acts of misconduct and misdemeanors , including , but not limited to , minor fights or disturbances . '' School districts also began softening their disciplinary practices as backlash against the so-called school-to-prison pipeline grew .\nNow the pendulum has swung back the other way again . Last year , as part of a bill codifying the recommendations of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission , Florida lawmakers edited the statute yet again to remove the prohibition on using zero tolerance policies to police misdemeanors and minor disturbances . The Orlando Sentinel reported that Osceola County school officials now report all minor fights to police as a result of the changes .\nCivil liberties groups argue the new laws and the safety commission 's recommendations threaten to bring back the bad days of zero tolerance , ushering in unproven safety policies and ignoring funding for things like more mental health services .\n`` We 've heard , for instance , that down in Miami-Dade County there are over a dozen officers in the same school , while there 's only one or two mental health care providers , '' says Bacardi Jackson , managing attorney for children 's rights at the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , a nonprofit legal advocacy and civil rights organization .\nJackson says her organization put together a focus group of young women from about 10 different Miami-Dade high schools to talk about their experience with police on campus .\n`` It was very , very troubling , '' she says . `` A number of the girls expressed how powerless they felt when they felt that they had been mistreated by an SRO . When someone made an inappropriate comment , when someone looked at them in a way that made them feel very uncomfortable , they did not believe they had the ability to report that without having some severe consequences . ''\nThe SPLC released a report in October arguing the commission 's recommendations `` will place students at greater risk of getting shot and/or wrongfully arrested ; put their privacy and liberty in jeopardy ; strip them of civil rights ; create school environments that are more tense , anxiety-provoking and traumatic ; breed distrust between students and faculty ; and absorb funds that could be used on programs that are actually shown to make schools safer for all students . ''\nCanady calls arguments that more SROs will necessarily result in more arrests `` hogwash . ''\n`` NASRO stands firmly on this , '' he says . `` Every school in this country could greatly benefit from a carefully selected , specifically trained SRO . ''\nIn fact , Canady argues that well-trained SRO with a good relationship among students and staff act as `` filters '' that reduce the number of arrests .\n`` They are the ones who have built relationships in that school , and they recognize they have a lot of other resources around them , '' Canady says . `` Instead of having to arrest everybody for misdemeanors like disorderly conduct , there would be that relationship where the SRO can step back and allow the school to take action . That is by and large what good SROs do . ''\nOne thing Canady and the SPLC do agree on , however , are zero tolerance policies .\n`` I 've never been a fan of them because what they do , at best , is remove discretion for good administrators and for good law enforcement officers , '' he says . `` I ca n't imagine being able to be productive as a law enforcement officer if I 'm always faced with zero tolerance . ''\nWhile schools may voluntarily or involuntarily report misbehavior to police , Florida police do have discretion to issue civil citations to juveniles for first-time misdemeanor offenses . A civil citation funnels the case into diversion programs rather than the local prosecutor 's office . Florida is a national leader in pre-arrest diversion for youths .\nBut there is no uniformity . A December report from the Caruthers Institute found that , while police issued civil citations in 68 percent of juvenile cases involving first-time misdemeanors statewide\u2014keeping thousands of kids out of the juvenile justice system\u2014some counties used citations in less than half of eligible cases . Others , like Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties , issue civil citations to students in more than 90 percent of cases . The report says this results in `` unequal justice by geography . ''\nAn investigation by the Orlando Sentinel also reported wide racial disparities in school arrests and citations . For example , the newspaper found that black students in Seminole County made up 15 percent of the student population , but they represented 80 percent of the school-related disorderly conduct incidents involving first-time offenders and 41 percent of misdemeanor assaults and batteries .\nAnd it found that the trend of declining in-school arrests had reversed in several central Florida counties , with Lake County posting a five-year high for school-related arrests in the 2018\u20132019 school year .\nNo police department or school wants to be accused of not doing enough to prevent a mass shooting , especially after Parkland .\nIn February , school officials in Seminole County subjected a 5-year-old boy to a threat assessment after he allegedly told a classmate , `` I wish someone killed you . '' Although they determined the threat was n't credible , the incident will stay in the county 's threat assessment database for 25 years .\nLast October , a police officer in Overland Park , Missouri , handcuffed and arrested an eighth grader who had formed her fingers into a pretend gun and pointed them at her classmates . Overland Park 's police chief put it bluntly to The Kansas City Star : `` I 'll take the heat all day long for arresting a 13-year-old . I 'm not willing to take the heat for not preventing a school tragedy . ''\nThe Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Association of School Resource Officers did not respond to requests for comment for this story .\nIn March , 6-year-old Kaia Rolle , whose arrest at school sparked national outrage , watched from the gallery of the Florida House of Representatives as lawmakers unanimously passed legislation inspired by her ordeal .\nThe law would n't have banned the arrests of small children , though . Instead , it would have required police departments to create policies surrounding arrests of children under 10 . The legislation died in the state Senate anyway .\n`` I 'm extremely disappointed , '' Rolle 's grandmother , Meralyn Kirkland , told the Orlando Sentinel . `` My family went through so much when Kaia was arrested\u2026and we 're still going through it . One of the biggest passions for me right now is seeing that no other family , no other child goes through what Kaia 's going through and what we 're going through . ''\nToday 's school discipline often shifts wildly from crisis to crisis . A more tenable solution would be to strike a balance that keeps schools safe without militarizing them . Schools should stop treating misbehavior that used to warrant a trip to the principal 's office like criminal offenses . Borderline cases should n't be punished out of fear or absurd zero tolerance policies .\nAnd the effects of any such changes should be rigorously tracked , with an eye on how they are used on the most vulnerable students .\nNeither Evan nor Terry 's son returned to their schools after they were Baker Acted . Both started sleeping in their parents ' beds again . Terry 's son is homeschooled now . Evan attends a private school , where his mother says he is doing well .\n`` He does n't talk about a whole lot of things , so we do n't really know what he 's carrying in there in his brain , '' Seiler says . `` We 'll get past this , but this should never have happened . ''\nSeiler filed a complaint against the SRO who allegedly tackled Evan . According to Seiler 's attorney , Palm Beach Schools Police Department launched an internal affairs investigation into the incident , but Seiler is still waiting for the results .\nTerry says the teacher pressed assault charges against his son , who received a deferred adjudication in youth court , meaning the case will be dismissed if his son stays out of trouble for a certain amount of time .\nHarmon has retained a lawyer and is planning to sue .\nSeiler 's lawyer says that children with disabilities who are Baker Acted often have nightmares and regress in terms of behavior , not to mention the blow they take to their perception of themselves .\n`` When you are 9 years old and you 've been told all your life that police officers arrest the bad people , and suddenly you find yourself in the back of a police car for behavior that you could n't control because you 're a child with a disability , what do you think about yourself now ? ''\nPalm Beach Schools Police Department did not respond to a request for comment for this story . The principal of Acreage Pines Elementary directed a request for comment to Palm Beach School District 's director of communications , who declined to comment , citing federal privacy laws for students .\nBoth Seiler and Terry struggled with the decision to share their stories and attach their names to them , but in the end , they both did it for the same \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` The real \u2588\u2588\u2588 I picked up the call is I said , if my experience can help just one family , it 'd be worth it , '' Terry says . `` So that 's my hope . ''\n`` It 's appalling , just appalling that this stuff goes on and no one seems to care , '' Seiler says . `` These kids are falling through the cracks . If this prevents any other kid and family from going through this , then yeah , that 's worth it . ''", "Previewing yet another item on his 2015 State of the Union Friday , President Obama announced a new plan to make community college tuition `` free . ''\n`` Today I 'm announcing an ambitious new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition in America , '' Obama said . `` I wan na bring it down to zero . I wan na make it free . ''\nObama may have spoken for over half-an-hour in Knoxville , Tennessee , where he was joined by both Sens . Bob Corker ( R-TN ) and Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) , but he left out a few details about his new program :\nObama may have sold his plan as `` free '' college tuition , but it is n't free to students and it definitely is n't free to taxpayers . First , Obama 's plan will only cover `` three-qarters of the average cost of community college . '' States are expected to pick up the tab for the remaining 25 percent . But even then , the program will only cover the `` average cost '' of tuition . Many students who go to schools with higher tuitions will still be on the hook for money .\nSecond , nothing is ever free for taxpayers . On Air Force One today , Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that the program will cost at least $ 60 billion over ten years .\n`` There are no free rides in America , '' Obama insisted today . And he 's right . Nothing is ever really free . `` Colleges would to do their part by offering high quality academics and helping students actually graduate , '' Obama continued . `` States would have to do their part to . This is n't a blank check . It is not a free lunch . ''\nAll this accountability may sound great in a political speech , but in real life what it all translates to is tons of paperwork and red tape for states and schools . If you loved the federalization of elementary education through No Child Left Behind , and all the millions of hours of paperwork that came with it , then you 'll love Obama 's plan to federalize community colleges .\n3 ) Too Many High School Students Are n't Prepared For Community College\nToo many high schools are already failing to prepare their graduates for college and making community college as universal as high school , which is what Obama said the goal of his new plan was , would only make the situation worse .\nA 2004 study found that not only did 68 percent of community college students take at least one remedial course , but of those that did take remedial courses , they had to take 2.9 of them . All Obama 's plan would really do is create nationally funded 6-year high schools .\nIf community colleges had a strong track record of taking unprepared or financially strained students through graduation and onto four-year institutions , then maybe Obama 's plan might begin to make some sense . But the simple fact is that they do n't .\nLess than 20 percent of first-time , full-time community college students complete their two-year degrees in three years . And of the only 20 percent of community college students who do transfer to four-year institutions , only 72 percent of them will finish or still be in school after another four years .\nNo government spending program exists in a vacuum . If the government subsidizes the price of a service , then the price of that service will go up . Which is exactly what has happened to the price of four-year college tuition since the federal government has been ramping up their grant and loan-guarantee spending .\nNot only will government subsidized tuition at public community colleges drive up the price of tuition at those colleges , but it will also crowd out private sector solutions . The Manhattan Institute 's Judah Bellin explains :", "\u201c The 360 \u201d shows you diverse perspectives on the day \u2019 s top stories and debates .\nIn March , millions of college students saw their worlds upended by the coronavirus pandemic . Fears of spreading the virus forced America \u2019 s universities to hastily shut down in-person instruction and transition to an ad hoc system of distance learning . With the spring semester ending for many , all eyes have shifted to whether colleges will welcome students back to their campuses in the fall .\nThere are more than 4,000 higher-education institutions in the U.S. Each is developing its own plans for the fall semester . It \u2019 s impossible to know what the state of the pandemic will be in August and September , when the school year typically starts . With students , parents and faculty members eager to know what the coming semester will look like , schools don \u2019 t have the luxury of waiting a couple of months to make their decisions .\nAbout two-thirds of colleges are planning for in-person instruction in the fall , according to a database kept by the Chronicle of Higher Education . That doesn \u2019 t mean things will be back to normal . A return to school could mean staggered class schedules , no large lectures , and a variety of public health measures interwoven into campus life . Several schools , including the University of South Carolina and Notre Dame , have adjusted the academic calendar so the fall semester will end before Thanksgiving , possibly ahead of an expected winter resurgence on the virus .\nOther universities have decided to keep campuses closed in the fall . The California State University system , the nation \u2019 s largest collection of colleges , will conduct its semester entirely online . Many of the country \u2019 s most prestigious private universities are considering a range of scenarios that may include a hybrid of online and in-person instruction .\nThe idea of bringing thousands of students and faculty together on college campuses in the fall has raised significant concern among some epidemiologists . Universities are particularly problematic when it comes to transmission of viruses because of the number of people who filter in and out on a daily basis and the social lives of many college students , some argue . If the virus does prove to be seasonal , low case counts over the summer could provide a false sense of security that may lead to a devastating outbreak if another wave hits near the end of the year .\nDistance learning will likely be much more worthwhile in the fall , others say , after schools have had several months to build their programs to replace the hastily thrown together plans they rolled out in March .\nThough they acknowledge the potential risks , advocates for bringing students back say a variety of steps can be taken to limit virus transmission . Even a significantly modified version of campus life may be preferable to distance learning , which many students and faculty members have expressed dissatisfaction with . The shift to online education has led many students to consider taking a year off \u2014 and educators fear some may never come back .\nFor some colleges , the decision may be largely financial . Some schools could permanently close if forced to go without income from tuition , events , housing and other on-campus revenue streams for another semester .\nOthers say there is not a one-size-fits-all policy that could be applied to the country \u2019 s incredibly diverse collection of colleges . The decision to open campus may depend on location , nature of the student body , university resources , local laws and a long list of other factors .\nMost schools that are planning to hold in-person classes in the fall are simultaneously developing backup plans in case coronavirus cases don \u2019 t drop over the next few months . The nation 's ability to contain the pandemic and monitor future outbreaks will likely play a major role in whether those contingencies prove necessary .\nThe benefits of in-person education outweigh the risks if the right protocols are in place\n\u201c Colleges and universities have a lot of work to do if they want to welcome students back on campus this fall . But in-person instruction , and the benefits that accompany student life in institutions across the United States , are essential parts of the higher-learning experience . It \u2019 s an effort well worth making. \u201d \u2014 Lanhee J. Chen and Vanila M. Singh , Washington Post", "The Senate is planning to vote Wednesday on a plan to bring interest rates on subsidized federal student loans back down to 3.4 percent for one more year . The rate doubled on July 1 when the chamber failed to agree on a plan .\nWhile the Senate prepares to take the issue back up , college students are left staring at several competing proposals .\nThis fight has been all about what 's best for those students . To make that point , House Republicans recently gathered more than 100 of them to sweat and squint under the summer sun for a press conference on the Capitol steps . The guys were wrapped in wool suits and ties \u2014 most of them congressional interns plucked from offices just that afternoon .\nOne of them was Wes Hodgin , who said he kept thinking one thing while he waited 45 minutes for House leaders to arrive : Do not faint .\n`` I 'm just going to try to stand out here , sweat all I can , and just not faint today , '' he said .\nHodgin 's going to be a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this fall . He has student loans , but not the subsidized kind , so the rate doubling on July 1 technically did n't affect him .\nNevertheless , House Republicans had one central message : The Senate still has n't passed a student loan plan .\n`` They 've been more involved in internal bickering rather than actually addressing the issue , '' said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , chairwoman of the House Republican Conference . `` And the students that are surrounded with us today \u2014 they 're all suffering because of it . ''\nWell , not quite yet . Most student loans are issued in August and September \u2014 a couple of weeks before classes begin \u2014 so as long as a deal goes through before then , the only students affected are the small group who borrowed money for summer school , and anything the Senate passes will likely retroactively apply to them anyway .\nThe holdup now in the Senate is where exactly to set interest rates and whether there should be a cap on those rates . The House plan has a cap . President Obama 's plan does n't . But Senate Democrats insist on a cap . So do student advocates , like Rory O'Sullivan of Young Invincibles .\n`` We do n't believe that the federal government should be charging students higher interest rates to pay down the federal deficit , '' O'Sullivan says . `` In that case , you 're essentially trading government debt for student debt . ''\nBut there 's a catch with a cap : It 's expensive . You have to factor in the added cost if market rates exceed that cap one day . And if you want to make sure the federal student loan plan is budget-neutral , you 'll have to set student loan rates a little higher .\nChris Lindstrom of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group compares the federal student loan program to a balloon filled with air . `` If you squeeze the balloon in one part to make it thinner , it expands and gets fatter in another part of the balloon , '' Lindstrom explains . `` It 's a zero-sum game . You 're not putting any air into it . ''\nNo lawmaker wants to be accused of setting rates too high . But every long-term proposal pegs rates to the 10-year Treasury note . So that means the rates under almost all of those plans is expected to exceed 6.8 percent before 10 years , based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office . That 6.8 percent figure is what the rate for subsidized loans became after rates doubled on July 1 .\nAs for what proposal offers the lowest interest rate \u2014 whether it 's the House plan , the president 's plan , or one of the Senate proposals \u2014 the differences come down to 1 or 2 percentage points at most .\nJason Delisle of the New America Foundation says it makes sense to care about those percentage points when you 're talking about home mortgage rates , `` but a home mortgage is $ 200,000 , $ 300,000 , $ 400,000 . So moving the interest rate a little bit lower makes a big difference in your monthly payment . That 's not so on a $ 20,000 student loan .\nDelisle says in that case , you 're talking about a difference of $ 10 , maybe $ 20 , a month . He says what people are really worried about is how unaffordable college is \u2014 and how much you actually have to borrow in the first place has a lot more to do with that problem than what your interest rate is .", "Mr. Loeb hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Cuomo this month at his home in East Hampton , N.Y .

But for Black and Hispanic families , the numbers are unprecedented .\nDeVos , who has been criticized for standing on the sidelines during the crisis , took a tough tone . During a call with governors , DeVos slammed the Fairfax , Va. , district for its distance learning \u201c disaster \u201d in the spring and offering a choice of only zero or two days of in-person instruction moving forward , according to notes of a call , led by Vice President Mike Pence , with governors obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Earlier in the pandemic , DeVos had been more open to kids learning both online and during in-person classes .\n\u201c Education leaders need to examine real data and weigh risk . \u2026 Risk is involved in everything we do , from learning to ride a bike to riding a rocket into space and everything in between , \u201d she said .\nBut a statement Tuesday night from teachers unions , the PTA , special education administrators and secondary school principals indicated that their relationship with the White House has hit a new low .\n`` Throughout this pandemic , the administration has failed to address the needs of students , especially those students who need the most support . They have failed to listen to families and public school educators who have been on the frontlines serving their communities , '' the statement read .\n`` Public school educators , students and parents must have a voice in critical conversations and decisions on reopening schools . The president should not be brazenly making these decisions . ''\nTrump and DeVos praised Florida \u2019 s new reopening plan , which orders the state \u2019 s public schools to reopen in August for at least five days per week for all students . `` We will put out the fires as they come up , but we have to open our schools , \u201d Trump said , and he decried \u201c political statements \u201d that will keep schools closed .\n\u201c They think it 's going to be good for them politically , so they keep the schools closed . No way , \u201d he said during a roundtable discussion at the White House . \u201c So we 're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools , to get them open . And it 's very important . It 's very important for our country . It 's very important for the well-being of the student and the parents . \u201d\nTrump had tweeted on Monday : `` Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don \u2019 t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons , not for health reasons ! They think it will help them in November . Wrong , the people get it ! ''\nThe push to reopen comes as parents agonize over whether it will be safe to send their kids back to school this fall and districts wrestle with whether and how to conduct classes . The reopening of schools is vital not just to getting the economy going , but to Trump \u2019 s reelection prospects . The campaign may be banking on the issue as a way to revive his appeal among disaffected suburban women , whose support will be key .\nThe Trump campaign is also seizing on former Vice President Joe Biden 's support of teachers unions that are stalwarts of Democratic politics and challenging Biden \u2019 s commitment to helping parents get their kids back to school . The campaign \u2019 s \u201c question of the day \u201d on Tuesday for the presumptive Democratic nominee is \u201c Will you side with union bosses who want to keep schools closed or parents who want their kids to keep learning ? ''\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar backed up DeVos , saying parents should expect schools to deliver a safe learning environment for their children , even during a pandemic .\n\u201c We must reopen , \u201d he said during a White House event on reopening schools . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to get people back to work , back to school , back to health care , because we ca n't stay locked in our homes forever . It 's bad for our physical and mental and emotional health \u2014 us as adults , as well as for our kids . \u201d\nBut Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda , president of the National Education Association , said `` the reality is no one should listen to Donald Trump or Betsy DeVos when it comes to what is best for students . ''\nAfter Trump tweeted , \u201c SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL ! ! ! , \u201d Garc\u00eda fired back on Monday , \u201c You forgot to add the word \u2018 SAFELY. \u2019 \u201d Biden , speaking to the NEA on Friday , pledged his administration will have a `` teacher-oriented '' Department of Education .\nMeanwhile , American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten tweeted on Tuesday that , to minimize the risk of spreading Covid-19 , schools need `` double the staff and double the space to teach in person . But with state budgets facing massive cuts as a result of the pandemic , we need federal funding to # ReopenSafely , '' she wrote .\nThe White House hosted events throughout Tuesday on safely reopening , culminating with the roundtable discussion with Trump , first lady Melania Trump , administration officials and teachers , administrators and students from around the country . House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) wrote an op-ed published in USA Today advocating liability protections for schools in any upcoming emergency relief package and underlining GOP support for helping parents with child care problems .\nLast spring , DeVos , in a slight departure from Trump , suggested through a spokesperson that schools may have to stick with virtual learning if they \u2019 re not ready to fully reopen . But on Tuesday , during the panel discussion at the White House , she praised Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran for issuing a \u201c very comprehensive \u201d plan to reopen in August for at least five days per week for all students .\n\u201c There may be other states and other communities that want to look at that , but again , with the expectation that students are together and that families will be able to count on a five-day school week if that \u2019 s the right answer for them , \u201d she said .\nDuring the later panel discussion with Trump , DeVos said too many students `` were trapped in schools that do n't meet their needs '' even before the virus , and that this is the time to reopen and rethink education \u2014 a common refrain for the school choice advocate .\n`` This moment demands actions , '' she said . `` Not excuse-making or fearmongering . ''\nThe White House is leaning on CDC reopening guidance and a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics that details the importance of in-person learning and \u201c strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school . \u201d\nCDC Director Robert Redfield said during another White House panel discussion that reopening plans should minimize the risk of Covid-19 while providing students the critical services , academic resources , and social and emotional support they need . And plans should anticipate that Covid cases `` will in fact occur . ''\n`` The CDC encourages all schools , all schools to do what they need to reopen , '' he said , adding that the agency \u2019 s guidance viewed as a recommendation to reopen . `` Nothing would cause me greater sadness than to see any school district or school use our guidance as a reason not to reopen . ''", "The President has been back out on the road again , spinning heartwarming tales and pushing for his second term agenda , as you \u2019 d expect any recently reelected leader to do . I \u2019 ll confess that I had a hard time paying attention to a lot of it , what with asteroids crashing to Earth on poop filled cruise ships and all , but there was one theme which caught my attention . He \u2019 s going all in on the hot new fad of comprehensive immigration reform .\nPresident Barack Obama told a group of Senate Democrats Wednesday that Congress must move forward with comprehensive immigration reform , or else he will propose his own legislation on the hot-button topic\u2026 In a description of Wednesday \u2019 s meeting , the White House said Obama \u201c reiterated the key principles he believes must be a part of any bipartisan , commonsense effort , including continuing to strengthen border security , creating an earned path to citizenship , holding employers accountable and streamlining legal immigration . \u201d\nEveryone seems to be talking about it these days , and not just Democrats . Republicans from Marco Rubio to John McCain have their own proposals , many of which involve some form of what the President is talking about . You can call it a \u201c path to citizenship \u201d or amnesty or Expedited Entry\u2026 whatever you like . But for some reason there are still quite a few of us who hear proposals such as these and get an uneasy feeling . For some of us , it may even be hard to quantify exactly what \u2019 s wrong . But if you harbor any such qualms , of course , you will be immediately labeled\u2026 say it with me\u2026\nWhatever . But as I considered the question this week , I realized that there might be a better way to describe exactly why this sounds troubling . And to understand it , you really need to talk about the story of Ray Bowman and William Kirkpatrick . Those names might not be familiar unless you lived in the Pacific Northwest in the 90s , but they were something of a legend . In a career spanning more than 16 years they robbed 28 banks around the country for a total of more than $ 7 million . I \u2019 m not going all anti-hero worship on you here , but you \u2019 ve got to admit\u2026 in terms of raw focus and mission attention , these guys were good . They stole a LOT of money without getting caught .\nBut the law finally caught up with them , and in 1999 they went to trial and were sent to lengthy stretches in the Crowbar Motel . Now here \u2019 s the thing about their story\u2026 during the trial , not one person \u2013 not in the media , the public , the courts or the government \u2013 not one single person stood up to say anything remotely like the following :\nYou know , yeah\u2026 okay .. they stole the money . But they \u2019 ve had it for a really long time now . And their families are depending on it for retirement and the kids \u2019 college . Some of it is invested in various places and we \u2019 d have to draw it out . Maybe , after all this time , we should just let them keep it .\nWhy did nobody say that ? The answer is because they broke the law and they got caught . This applies for virtually any other law you could name\u2026 except for illegal immigration . As things stand now , crossing the border without the proper authorization and paperwork is a crime . Beyond that , continuing to stay here without said credentials is also a crime . If you do this , you are committing a crime each and every day that you are here . But for some reason , we seem to be reaching the point where we \u2019 re fine with treating this as more of a game of Red Rover Red Rover . Yes , it \u2019 s a crime to come over the border uninvited , but if you make it to home base , maybe we \u2019 ll just forget about it .\nNow , before the inevitable , hollow argument comes flying back at me here , I \u2019 m not talking about anything resembling the statute of limitations . ( Why we have a statute of limitations is a debate for another day . ) Bowman and Kirkpatrick kept committing crimes all through their run . And people who are here illegally continue to break the law every single day by the simple fact of being in the country . If you want to have a discussion about a statute on illegal immigration where people can leave for seven years and have it dropped from their record\u2026 fine . We can have that debate . But it doesn \u2019 t apply to this situation .\nAllow me to also answer the second , inevitable question which crops up every time we have this discussion . No , I have no idea what to do about the five million or twelve million or twenty million illegal immigrants currently breaking the law every single day in this country . I have not even the beginning of a hint as to what should be done about it . I also don \u2019 t know what to do about the 90 % of robberies that go unsolved each year . But I \u2019 m pretty sure that the answer isn \u2019 t to decriminalize theft .\nI \u2019 ve had some conflicting feelings about this immigration question myself , I confess . But America either is or it is not a nation of laws . If we are to change our system so that entering our nation without permission is no longer a crime \u2013 or at least not that serious of one \u2013 then lawmakers need to make that clear . But don \u2019 t tell us you \u2019 re doing it just because you can \u2019 t figure out how to stop people from breaking the law . And if keeping control of our borders and retaining management of who does or does not enter is still an important priority and a criminal matter , that should be made clear also . What we \u2019 re getting out of Washington now is static , clarifying nothing and selling a feel-good product which doesn \u2019 t seem to address any of these questions .", "Sen. Marco Rubio says he \u2019 s done more on the issue of immigration than former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton ever has .\n\u201c I mean , I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats . And that \u2019 s more than she \u2019 s ever done . She \u2019 s given speeches on it , but she \u2019 s never done anything on it . So I have a record of trying to do something on it , \u201d the Florida Republican , who announced his 2016 presidential bid on Monday , told NPR .\nMr. Rubio \u2019 s support in 2013 for the comprehensive bill , which he eventually backed away from , ended up costing him with some conservatives . He said that the push ultimately didn \u2019 t work because the issue of illegal immigration was not sufficiently addressed and that he warned about that through the process \u2014 but said immigration reform is still necessary .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t think you can do it in a comprehensive , massive piece of legislation , given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the American people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control \u2014 that if we legalize 12 million people , they won \u2019 t be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally , \u201d Mr. Rubio said . \u201c And I honestly believe , given my experiences on this issue now , that if we did that , the American people and the majority of Republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and , and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally . \u201d\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee , though , skewered Mr. Rubio \u2019 s position on the issue .\nSEE ALSO : Marco Rubio hails inspirational personal story in launching 2016 bid\n\u201c He even went so far as to run away from his own immigration plan when the most extreme wing of his party put pressure on him , \u201d said Ms. Wasserman Schultz , Florida Democrat . \u201c Rubio says he \u2019 s a new type of Republican , but the only things he \u2019 s ever championed are the same failed policies the public has already rejected , and the only cause he \u2019 s ever advanced is his own . \u201d", "When it takes up the question of whether President Obama 's 2014 immigration executive actions were constitutional , the Supreme Court will throw out its typical playbook .\nUnited States v. Texas is one of the most \u2014 if not the most \u2014 important cases before the highest court this term . It 's certainly the most important immigration case the Supreme Court has taken up in a generation ( or , arguably , a century ) . And the Court is treating it accordingly .\nOn Monday , instead of splitting up 60 minutes of oral arguments between the two sides of the case , as usually happens , the Court will convene for 90 minutes \u2014 and bring in more parties to argue their case .\nTexas and the 25 other states suing will get 30 minutes . The federal government will get 35 . But the Supreme Court has also given 10 minutes to a lawyer representing a group of immigrant women who 'd benefit from Obama 's executive actions . And that 's not all \u2014 15 minutes will go to the US House of Representatives ( thanks to the Republican House majority ) , which has jumped in to support the states .\nThe unusually complicated oral argument process reflects just how messy this case is . It 's a case covering surprisingly narrow-sounding legal questions , but its outcome carries broad implications for the relationship between Congress and the president , and the relationship between the federal government and the states . Oh , yeah \u2014 and it 's a presidential election year , and both immigration and the Court itself have become election issues .\nAll this makes it something of a nightmare scenario for Chief Justice John Roberts , who tends to be more anxious than the typical Supreme Court justice to present the Court 's opinions as drawn purely from law rather than politics .\nAs the justices hear oral arguments and consider the case before issuing an opinion ( which they 're expected to do in late June , at the end of the term ) , Roberts and the other justices will have to work through legal questions that are both less contentious and more abstract than the broader immigration debate makes them seem .\nThen they 'll have to figure out if there 's any way they can cobble together a five-vote majority for a lasting opinion \u2014 or if the eight-person Court will deadlock , putting the most important case of the Court 's term in limbo and creating the opportunity for chaos .\nIn November 2014 , President Obama issued a series of memos declaring executive actions on immigration . Two of those are at issue in this case .\nOne memo expanded the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , or DACA , which since 2012 had allowed immigrants who 'd come to the US as children to apply for temporary protection from deportation and work permits .\nThe other one added a new deferred action program \u2014 the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program \u2014 which would have allowed millions of unauthorized immigrants who have US citizen or permanent resident children to apply for deportation protection and work permits as well .\nThe two 2014 actions are usually referred to as DAPA/DACA+ . Since the states won in the lower courts , both of them have been put on hold since the first ruling was issued in February 2015 . The original DACA program from 2012 , however , is still in place and is n't being challenged in this suit . ( To prevent confusion , I 'll just refer to DAPA instead of DAPA/DACA+ when talking about the 2014 actions . )\n2 ) Why did President Obama create this program in the first place ?\nFederal immigration enforcement has totally transformed over the past 20 years . More people are eligible for deportation than ever before . The growth of the unauthorized population pre\u2013Great Recession meant there were more people to deport . After 9/11 , the government got vastly more money and resources for deportation . And deportations escalated accordingly \u2014 from 183,000 in 1999 to a high of 400,000 during the first several years of the Obama administration .\nPresident Obama has spent most of his time in office trying to impose some sort of control on all of this \u2014 to make sure the government is choosing who 's most important to deport , rather than arbitrarily deporting anyone Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents get their hands on . His first attempts \u2014 setting high and low `` priorities '' for deportation and telling immigration agents to follow them \u2014 were something both sides in the current court case agree he could do but that rank-and-file immigration agents frequently ignored in favor of their own judgment .\nSo in 2012 , President Obama created the first deferred action program , DACA \u2014 allowing people to proactively apply for protection from deportation , rather than simply hoping that ICE followed the memo not to deport them . It 's been solidly effective . After comprehensive immigration reform stalled in Congress in 2013 , pressure grew on Obama to use the tool that had worked \u2014 deferred action \u2014 to protect other groups of low-priority immigrants , and he did just that with DAPA and expanded DACA in 2014 .\nDAPA was supposed to be the program that ensured Obama 's legacy on immigration , turning him from the `` deporter in chief '' of his first term to a man who brought immigrants out of the shadows . If the Supreme Court lets the program go forward , that legacy is assured . If it strikes DAPA down , Obama 's legacy \u2014 and immigrants ' attitude toward the Democratic Party \u2014 will be an ambivalent and disappointing one .\n3 ) How did United States v. Texas get to the Supreme Court ?\nUnited States v. Texas is political in its origins . That does n't at all mean that the states that sued the Obama administration are wrong on the merits \u2014 it 's just an acknowledgment of the circumstances around the case 's genesis shortly after Obama announced the executive actions .\nThere was n't a serious legal challenge to the original DACA program in 2012 , even though many of the criticisms of DAPA in this case would have applied to DACA as well . But in June 2012 the country was in the middle of a general election campaign , and the Republican nominee was trying to run toward the center and appeal to Latinos . In November 2014 , on the other hand , the relatively unpopular President Obama was responding to an electoral defeat in the midterm elections \u2014 including the loss of the Senate \u2014 with executive actions on an issue that mobilized the GOP base .\nThe states on each side of the case have lined up along partisan lines . The Texas suit involves 23 states \u2014 all but three of them under unified Republican control \u2014 as well as four Republican governors ( three of whom have Democratic attorneys general who would n't let the state officially join the case ) and one Republican attorney general . The states that have filed briefs supporting the Obama administration , meanwhile , represent about two-thirds of the states with Democratic attorneys general .\nTexas is leading the coalition of states bringing the lawsuit for two reasons . One , it 's offered the most persuasive case for how DAPA could actually hurt the state ( more on that later ) . Two , it houses the Southern District of Texas , which was the court the states chose to file their case in , presumably because they knew they 'd have a good chance there . ( The administration and its allies have implied that this is unfair , but it happens all the time . )\nThey chose wisely . In February 2015 \u2014 just a few days before the government was scheduled to start accepting applications for expanded DACA \u2014 Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunction , preventing the government from moving ahead with the program on the logic that the states were `` likely '' to prevail on some of their claims . The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction . And in January , the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case .\nAs the case has made its way through the courts , it 's gotten much broader . Initially , the injunction was based on a narrow claim that the Obama administration had n't used the right procedure in instituting DAPA . The Fifth Circuit ruled that DAPA was also ( or at least , was likely to be ) illegal on the merits . And now the Supreme Court has added a constitutional question : whether DAPA violates the `` take care '' clause of the Constitution .\nWhile this is theoretically still a ruling on the injunction , the Supreme Court is dealing with the merits of the case \u2014 ensuring that if a majority of the Court 's eight justices side with the Obama administration , or with the states , the case is finished ( and DAPA is alive , or dead ) for the duration of Obama 's time in office .\nThe stakes have risen accordingly . The House of Representatives asked , and was granted , the chance to argue that DAPA violates laws that Congress has passed \u2014 something that is n't totally unheard of at the Supreme Court level but certainly raises the political temperature of the case .\nAnd on the federal government 's side , the argument on behalf of the `` Jane Doe '' immigrant women \u2014 not to mention the likely presence of many potential DAPA beneficiaries in the Supreme Court during the oral arguments \u2014 will inevitably remind the justices that this is a question of the balance and separation of powers , and about immigrants themselves .\n4 ) What is the Supreme Court actually ruling on in this case ?\nBecause immigration is such a divisive culture war issue \u2014 and because phrases like `` enforce the law '' get tossed around frequently as talking points \u2014 it sure seems like this case should be a massive legal dispute over what should happen to unauthorized immigrants in the US . But it 's not . There are four questions at play in the case , and all of them are , given the importance of the case , relatively narrow .\n1 ) Is it even legal for Texas to sue the federal government to stop the DAPA program ?\nThe states ' case , in one sentence : It costs the state government money to give subsidized driver 's licenses to DAPA recipients who now qualify for them .\nThe federal government 's case , in one sentence : If that were all it took for a state to sue the federal government over a policy it did n't like , the courts would be clogged forever .\nThe first question the Court has to address whether Texas and the other states had `` standing '' \u2014 whether they are legally able to bring the lawsuit at all . In order to show standing , Texas has to show that implementing DAPA causes some direct harm to the state .\nEven if the substance of Texas 's legal argument against DAPA is correct , if it ca n't show that it had standing the whole suit gets dismissed \u2014 allowing DAPA to go into effect after all . ( This route would give the Supreme Court some appealing options , as we 'll get to in a bit . )\nThe Republican governors and state attorneys general on Texas 's side of the case clearly think that allowing unauthorized immigrants to remain in their states is harmful for all sorts of reasons . But as is often the case with Supreme Court cases \u2014 and is definitely the case with this one \u2014 the actual argument being put forward in the courtroom is a lot narrower than the argument over whether unauthorized immigrants are good or bad for America that 's happening around the case .\nSo far , courts have found that the states have standing for a single reason : Texas driver 's license costs . Under Texas law , people who get deferred action are eligible for driver 's licenses \u2014 and because fees only partially cover the cost of producing a license , the state government covers the rest of the cost . DAPA would make hundreds of thousands of Texans eligible to apply for driver 's licenses for the first time , which would cost the state money .\nThe Supreme Court now has to decide whether that 's enough of a reason to allow Texas ( and the other states ) to sue the federal government over the entire policy .\nThe federal government argues it 's not President Obama 's fault that Texas law would allow DAPA recipients to get driver 's licenses . Furthermore , supporters of the federal government 's side in this case argue there 's a slippery slope : Allow the states to sue the government over a policy they do n't like , as long as they can show that it costs the state something ( even if that cost is recouped ) , and the courts will be clogged with lawsuits left and right .\nThey 're hoping that possibility will scare Chief Justice Roberts ( who dissented in a previous case about states suing the federal government , Massachusetts v. EPA ) into protecting the Supreme Court 's legacy by remaining above the dispute .\n2 ) Is DAPA a substantive new regulation \u2014 which the Obama administration did n't follow the proper procedure for ?\nThe federal government 's argument , in one sentence : Nope , it 's just a general `` statement of policy , '' and we do those all the time .\nThe states ' argument , in one sentence : It sets pretty hard-and-fast standards for who qualifies for deferred action and work authorization ; that seems pretty rule-like .\nThis question also seems pretty narrow \u2014 it 's a challenge about whether the Obama administration did DAPA the right way , instead of whether it was the right thing to do . So it might not get a lot of the Supreme Court 's attention . But this was actually the basis for the original ruling freezing DAPA , issued in February 2015 by Judge Hanen of the Fifth Circuit .\nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act , the government ca n't just issue new regulatory `` rules '' ; it has to propose them and then allow a certain period for public response . ( Hence the term `` notice and comment , '' which comes up a bunch when people are discussing this aspect of the Supreme Court case . )\nThe Obama administration did n't do this with DAPA . It argues it did n't have to , because it was n't a real rule , just a general guideline . The states disagree .\nAt root , this is a disagreement about how the deferred action programs actually work : whether immigration agents actually have the leeway to reject applications for any reason ( policy-like ) or whether the Obama administration has dictated that anyone who meets the standards should get protection ( rule-like ) .\nAnd because DAPA has n't gone into effect yet , this is really an argument about how the original DACA program is working \u2014 even though the existing deferred action program is n't being challenged in this case .\n3 ) Is DAPA within the president 's authority , or does it encroach on parts of immigration law where Congress has already set down the rules ?\nThe federal government 's argument , in one sentence : DAPA is just a way to tell immigrants they 're not being deported \u2014 something that both sides agree is legal .\nThe states ' argument , in one sentence : DAPA goes beyond that , by bestowing `` lawful presence '' and work permits on immigrants Congress did n't want to grant either one to .\nLegally , this is the biggest question about DAPA : Does it violate US law by going beyond what the president is allowed to do on immigration ? But again , the disagreement between the two sides in the actual court case is a lot narrower than you 'd think ( given the general heatedness of the immigration debate ) .\nUS immigration law gives the president a lot of latitude to make policy decisions \u2014 more than he gets in a lot of other areas . So the states in this case agree that President Obama ( and the rest of the executive branch ) have the latitude to choose whom to deport and whom not to deport . The states even say it would be okay if the Obama administration issued cards to people who were `` low priorities '' for deportation indicating that they were low priorities .\nBut they say DAPA goes beyond what the president is allowed to do , and crosses into areas where Congress has set firm rules on immigration , in two ways . It allows deferred action recipients to apply for work permits , which the states argue violates Congress 's intent not to allow unauthorized immigrants to work legally in the US . And , they say , DAPA deems people to be `` lawfully present '' in the US even though Congress has said it 's illegal for them to be here .\nThe phrase `` lawful presence '' is probably going to be thrown around a lot at Monday 's oral arguments \u2014 it 's become increasingly central to the states ' argument . The federal government argues that the states are simply getting confused . `` Lawful presence '' is n't the same thing as `` lawful status '' in immigration law \u2014 it does n't grant anyone the right to be in the US . ( The federal government has started arguing that it 's really more like `` tolerated presence . '' )\n3 ) Is Obama abandoning his constitutional obligation to `` take care '' to enforce Congress 's laws by implementing DAPA ?\nThis question was n't even considered in the lower courts \u2014 the Supreme Court added it to the case on its own . It centers on the Constitution 's `` take care '' clause : `` He shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . ''\nThere is n't a lot of Supreme Court jurisprudence on what this phrase actually charges the president to do , so it 's interesting that the Court felt it was particularly appropriate here \u2014 though it 's entirely possible that the justice interested in this was Antonin Scalia and the surviving justices do n't have any interest .\nThe answer to the `` take care '' question depends on whether DAPA violates US law to begin with . If the federal government is right , and DAPA is within the president 's legal authority , then he 's not abandoning his duty to execute the laws by implementing it . If the states are right , and DAPA is illegal , then Obama might be violating the `` take care '' clause in implementing it \u2014 but the program would be struck down in any event .\nFor people who believe that President Obama is legally obligated to deport unauthorized immigrants under all circumstances , the idea that he 's violating the constitution by not `` taking care '' to enforce immigration laws has some appeal . But again , neither side is actually arguing that in court .\n5 ) How is the Supreme Court likely to rule ? And how does Justice Scalia 's death affect this ?\nThere are dozens of hypothetical possible answers the Court could reach to any of the four questions above . But in terms of the case 's practical outcome , there are essentially four options .\nIf `` swing vote '' Justice Anthony Kennedy ( or Chief Justice Roberts ) joins the liberal wing of the Court , the Obama administration will get an outright five-vote majority . The lower court rulings will be overturned , and DAPA and DACA+ will start accepting applications .\nIf the conservative wing of the Court gets a five-vote majority , with a liberal justice joining the conservative wing , the lower court ruling siding with the states will be upheld for good , and DAPA and DACA+ will be permanently dead . ( This is unlikely , but it 's certainly not impossible . )\nIf Kennedy joins the conservative side , but the Court 's four liberal justices stick together , nobody will get a majority . Justice Scalia 's absence will create a 4-4 tie . That would leave the existing injunction in place \u2014 forcing the Obama administration to keep DAPA on ice \u2014 but it would force the lower courts to go back and issue final rulings on the case , which they still have n't done .\nFurthermore \u2014 and this is where things get really messy \u2014 the absence of a Supreme Court opinion could allow another circuit court to hear a case on DAPA and rule that it could go forward . How such a lawsuit would proceed is unclear ; maybe some of the states that sided with the Obama administration could find standing . But it would create a situation in which DAPA was legal in some parts of the country and illegal in others .\nIt 's entirely possible that the Supreme Court would go out of its way to avoid that level of chaos . That 's why some analysts think the most likely outcome is this :\nChief Justice Roberts joins with the Court 's liberals to throw out the case based on standing \u2014 siding with the federal government on the first question and ruling that Texas did n't have the right to bring the suit at all .\n6 ) What does the case mean for people in the real world ?\nIf the Court sides with the states , nothing changes \u2014 programs that currently are n't in effect wo n't go into effect . But if the Court sides with the administration , an estimated 4.5 million immigrants who are currently vulnerable to deportation will get three years of protection and the ability to work in the US legally .\nThe effects this could have on the lives of those immigrants ( and their families ) could be huge .\nThe evidence from DACA , which has protected about 700,000 immigrants for the past three and a half years , is promising . Three-quarters of DACA recipients had been able to get better-paying jobs , 30 percent had gone back to school , and 59 percent said they could help support their families . There 's evidence that DACA helps keep immigrants integrated into American life \u2014 instead of losing interest in school or career because they feel their immigration status holds them back .\nIf the Supreme Court reinstates DAPA at the end of June , the Obama administration will only have seven months left in office to process applications \u2014 and many of the community groups that would have been able to help people get those applications will be busy mobilizing for the election .\nFurthermore , the election might discourage some immigrants from wanting to sign up to begin with \u2014 if they 're worried that Donald Trump will be president come 2017 , they 'll be much less inclined to turn over their personal information to the government .\n7 ) What happens when a new president gets elected in November ?\nDAPA is an Obama administration initiative . There 's nothing stopping the next president from ending the program and rescinding its protections , even if the Supreme Court upholds it this year . Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have already promised to do just that in their first few days in office .\nThat does n't mean that the immigrants who have gotten deferred action so far would necessarily get deported . In fact , that 's the bigger decision that President Cruz or Trump would have to make : what to do with a database of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are unauthorized but who by definition are well-educated , speak English , or at least have kids who are US citizens .\nA President Trump might start his mass deportation campaign by targeting the immigrants he can most easily locate : former deferred action recipients .\nSome pundits have argued that this means the real immigration fight is what happens in November , rather than what happens in the courts this spring . Insofar as the next president will choose whether to end deferred action , that 's true . But the Supreme Court decision could definitely shape what options a president has to expand it , as both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have promised to do .\nSanders has explicitly said that he 'd protect some 8 or 9 million people using deferred action ; Clinton has said she would n't deport immigrants who had n't committed crimes , but has n't explained how she 'd protect them .\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down DAPA \u2014 or upholds it , but articulates a limiting principle that clarifies that this is the most a president can do \u2014 both of those plans will be a lot harder to implement , but a Democratic president would be under even more pressure to find a way to protect immigrants . That could create trouble .\n8 ) What kind of precedent is set if the Court sides with the Obama administration ?\nConservatives siding with the states in United States v. Texas argue that if Obama wins this case , there 's no limit to who could be protected from deportation . They make a persuasive case .\nThe Obama administration argues that while DAPA was legal , it would n't have been legal to give deferred action to even more immigrants \u2014 say , parents of DACA recipients . But their reasoning on this point is fairly weak ( and it does n't help that both candidates for their own party 's presidential nomination are promising to do just that ) .\nThis lack of `` limiting principle '' gives conservatives a lot of pause . A president could do whatever he likes on a whole host of issues \u2014 say , refuse to enforce any environmental regulations , or even declare a tax cut by executive fiat . ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Andrew Prokop lays out some of the options . )\nHypotheticals like these raise some valid concerns about the use of prosecutorial discretion generally . But these are issues with existing law , and it 's not clear that a ruling for the feds in this case would make them any worse .\nMany legal scholars believe that immigration law simply gives the president more discretion than other areas of law . So a ruling for Obama in this case would n't necessarily create a precedent for other issues .\n9 ) What kind of precedent does it set if the Court sides with the states ?\nIf the president has historically had a lot of leeway to set immigration policy , though , a ruling for the states would effectively constrain that power .\nThe states in this case are n't asking the Supreme Court to issue a broad ruling . But that does n't stop the Court from doing so if it wants . And if the Court finds that it 's illegal for the president to allow a large group of immigrants to apply for work permits , that definitely calls the original DACA program into question \u2014 and raises questions for other uses of executive power on immigrations as well . ( An extremely broad ruling against the president could even dictate that the executive branch ca n't declare immigrants `` low priorities '' for deportation , though that 's extremely unlikely . )\nBut even a relatively narrow ruling for the states would have implications for other issues where the president did n't have as much leeway to begin with .\nIt 's possible to imagine a Supreme Court ruling against Obama whose argument implicitly called into question other things he 's done , from delaying the employer mandate to modifying key provisions of No Child Left Behind ( not to mention the original DACA program ) . It would n't automatically strike down any of these , but it could open the door to future court challenges .\nWhat legal scholars who side with the administration are particularly concerned about , though , is what will happen if Texas and the other states are granted standing at all \u2014 even if the Court ultimately sides with Obama . They argue that this would essentially invite states to sue the federal government over any policy they do n't like , and then hunt down some way the policy harms them . ( In an amicus brief , for example , law professor Walter Dellinger argues that states could start suing the IRS over which organizations are exempt from federal taxes . )\nTo a certain extent , this is what the states are doing anyway \u2014 no state has ever sued the federal government for doing something the state likes . But the Supreme Court has long tried to avoid becoming a way for states to challenge federal policy willy-nilly . That 's the sort of politics it tends to want to stay out of .\nThen again , the lesson of United States v. Texas may very well be that even if politics stop at the Supreme Court door , the cases that come in \u2014 and what happens to decisions that come out \u2014 are political from start to finish .", "Europe is experiencing the largest movement of people across its borders since World War II , and it is struggling . It \u2019 s not just wrestling with capacity and enforcement , as the crush of Middle Easterners and Africans take to the Mediterranean and trek across frontiers , but also testing the limits of its humanitarianism .\nThe human tide has weighed heavily on some countries and inundated swaths of European countryside or urban space \u2013 eliciting fortitude and generosity of spirit , which has been undercovered . It has also revealed a dark side to the continent : fences , tear gas , riots , and hate speech .\nToday \u2019 s migrants are as poor or traumatized as those refugees during World War II , but many are also black or Muslim . They stand out in communities that have long known nothing but homogeneity . And they are entering at a time when EU citizens question what it really means to live in the 28-member union .\nThese questions have been brewing for years , but the sheer scale of migration has thrust them suddenly from abstract scenarios into a situation demanding answers now . Through July of this year , some 340,000 have attempted to reach Europe \u2019 s doorstep according to EU statistics , nearly three times the same period of last year . And so far nearly 2,440 have died trying .\nIn an ongoing series called Seeking Refuge , the Monitor has searched for themes and lessons learned in the midst of one of the European Union 's greatest modern tests .\nWhen a boat capsized in April off of Libya , killing nearly 800 migrants on board , the argument that the EU should scale back patrols to deter migration \u2013 as they were doing at the time of the tragedy \u2013 was flipped on its head .\nRescue patrols and walls factor into a migrant \u2019 s choices to attempt the trip , but it doesn \u2019 t deter his or her decision to leave war or poverty . Life is still better in Europe .\nThat has been put in sharp focus in Greece . We kicked off the series on the island of Kos , where migrants were steadily streaming in amid an economic crisis that sapped the Greek state 's capacity \u2013 or appetite \u2013 to house and care for thousands of newcomers . Since then tens of thousands have arrived anyway , with 21,000 showing up in one week in August alone .\n2 . Much of Europe see the migrants as 'the other guy 's ' problem\nGreece and Italy face the physical crush of arrivals , while Germany , Sweden , and Britain are where most migrants want to go . Germany announced this week that it expects 750,000 asylum claims this year , four times more than last year .\nYet in between are nearly two dozen countries that do not see migration as their problem . An EU plan to relocate and resettle some 60,000 migrants has sent much of Europe into an emotional tailspin . One of the countries feeling the brunt of criticism for not doing its part is Britain .\nCentral and Eastern Europe , meanwhile , which have almost no experience with this type of migration , condemned Brussels for placing a burden on their shoulders where they say it doesn \u2019 t belong \u2013 even though emigration has long been that region 's only escape valve . In the end , a broad , mandatory relocation plan was torpedoed in favor of a smaller , voluntary one \u2013 which nonetheless continues to rile .\n`` There is no incentive for central European countries to accept relocation . They don \u2019 t see it as their problem , \u201d said Elizabeth Collett , director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe in Brussels .\nFor all of the anger directed at Brussels , critics make a valid point too . Europe 's system for accepting migrants doesn \u2019 t work . The policy that \u2019 s been most tested is the Dublin Regulation , the European treaty that stipulates that refugees must have their asylum applications processed by the EU country they first set foot in . Though the convention is meant to be mandatory , overloaded periphery countries are turning a blind eye to the migrants who wish to move on , as virtually all do .\nSo the migrants easily leave , and take advantage of another European rule that applies to most countries in the bloc : the passport-free Schengen zone .\nEarlier in the summer , France started checking passports at its frontier with Italy to dissuade migrants from entering \u2013 a violation of Schengen rules , particularly as it happened just as Europeans kicked off the summer vacation season .\n\u201c This is a much wider problem than Schengen , but Schengen is the victim because it becomes a symbol of all the fears , that we are defenseless , \u201d explained Marc Pierini , a visiting scholar on European policy at Carnegie Europe in Brussels .\nNow many of those same migrants who crossed the Italian-French border are amassing in Calais , at France \u2019 s northern edge . This time they face a harder task moving onto their final destination , Britain , both because of geography and because Britain is not part of Schengen . Thousands have stormed the Eurotunnel this summer , leaving at least nine dead .\nThis migration crisis has given a high-profile platform to xenophobia . It has led Hungary , where numbers of migrants entering has dramatically spiked , to start building a wall . The Slovakian government said it would accept refugees from Syria but only Christian ones , not Muslims .\nRich Clabaugh/Staff Europe 's migration crisis : The eastern Mediterranean and western Baltic routes\nAnd yet , there are European citizens who are trying to rise above the fear . As the newest flashpoint has appeared in the Balkans , at Greece \u2019 s border with Macedonia , authorities have tried to keep them back with batons . Meanwhile , one group waits for their arrival \u2013 with supplies .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never seen anything like this , \u201d said Gabriela Andreevska , a young Macedonian who spends most nights at the border , helping the migrants trying to reach the EU . \u201c So many people sleeping on concrete . They \u2019 re there , and you can \u2019 t turn a blind eye . \u201d\nIn the heated discussion about Europe \u2019 s migration crisis , which can bleed into the wider debate over security and terrorism , it \u2019 s easy to forget the most important lesson of all .

The order had been expected to emerge sometime this week .\nThe order will form the second thrust of a new administration push to significantly overhaul the shape of the American immigration system , following the release of new memos Tuesday empowering state and local authorities to enforce laws that could eventually lead to mass deportations .\nIt also marks an important moment for Trump 's vision of an expansive executive presidency as he contemplates other areas of sweeping policy action .\nThe significance of this new attempt -- the language of which is expected as soon as Wednesday -- is reflected in the participation of White House Counsel Don McGahn .\nMcGahn 's office had only a cursory look at Trump 's original order , which was written by transition and policy staff . Significantly , Trump 's key political aide Stephen Miller has had much less to do with the second executive order , sources familiar with the matter said , and the Trump administration was communicating with Republicans on Capitol Hill about the legislation .\nAnother administration official disputed the notion that Miller is less involved now , saying he is in fact more involved in this process than the first one .\nTrump 's initial attempt to install a travel ban -- one of his fundamental campaign promises -- was a disaster , halting the administration 's fast start in its tracks .\nJUST WATCHED Iran : Travel ban an affront to the entire nation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iran : Travel ban an affront to the entire nation 10:54\nThe move temporarily blocking citizens of Syria , Sudan , Yemen , Iran , Iraq , Somalia and Libya from entering the US unleashed a weekend of chaos at the nation 's airports , after the hurriedly drafted and poorly implemented order caused confusion among border and customs officials about what it actually meant and which classes of travelers were included .\nHis order was quickly halted by the federal courts in a first showdown between his strong-arm executive powers and the judiciary -- leading Trump to belittle judges on Twitter .\nThe showdown inflicted an early blow on the reputation of the new White House and claims that Trump 's expertise as a master dealmaker and businessman would make up for his inexperience in Washington and governance as he set about fundamentally transforming America .\nStung by the scorn of the courts and the political world , the White House eventually retreated to plot a new approach -- one that is likely to be considerably narrower than the initial version . Permanent US residents , or green card holders , for instance , are expected to be exempted from the ban .\nTrump rarely admits an error or apologizes for a misstep . But even he realizes that there is not much he can do but frame a new executive order to satisfy the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ' decision upholding a stay on the order imposed by a federal judge in Seattle .\nHis spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that the administration would tailor the new order to the ruling of the 9th Circuit and that the new plan was `` basically completed . ''\n`` I think what we 're now doing is working with the various agencies and departments to make sure that the implementation of that is done in an extremely smooth way , '' Spicer said .\nIt is vital for the credibility of the President and a White House that things do indeed go smoothly this time around .\nThis may be the best , last chance for the administration to establish whether it can write an executive order that can honor Trump 's goals but at the same time not fall foul of constitutional due process rights of travelers trying to get into the United States who might be covered by the ban .\nThe White House faces a high bar in drafting the new order because its constitutional interpretation has already proven open to being challenged . The 9th Circuit , for instance , rejected the administration 's argument that the judiciary lacked the authority to block the travel ban as `` contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy . ''\nApart from the legal minefield the new order must traverse , the Trump White House has huge political credibility tied up in the travel ban .\nA repeat of angry demonstrations at airports , with tales of travelers being turned back after getting on planes with what they thought were valid visas , would deal another blow to the new administration .\nBy Tuesday , there were initial signs that the administration had started to conduct the widespread consultation among its allies in the House and the Senate that was missing with the initial travel ban .\nA top House Republican aide said the Department of Homeland Security had been in touch with House Speaker Paul Ryan 's office about the new executive order . But it is unclear whether the White House has been engaging with the committees with jurisdiction over immigration and national security .\nKeeping allies in the loop is important because the refashioned executive order is likely to be viewed elsewhere in Washington as an omen for whether the administration is able to pull off the technical , legislative and political lifts needed to implement the promises for fundamental changes in America that Trump vowed as a candidate .\nOf course , there is certain to be anger and controversy once the new order is released -- its opponents will brand it unconstitutional and un-American and the affected nations are likely to vocally protest and may take counter-measures . Lawsuits are already promised .\nBut a smooth implementation process could at least preserve the administration political space to press ahead with a scheme that does garner support from many Americans , especially Trump supporters .\nIt would also spare Capitol Hill Republicans from media interrogations about the White House 's ham-handed unveiling of the original order .\nThere is intense interest in Washington and around the world about how the second executive order will differ from Trump 's initial attempt .\nGoing forward , a new order could also only apply to people who are not yet in the visa process .

Until that happens the door is left open . \u201d\nRepublicans have a series of piecemeal reform bills that satisfy the conservatives ' call for more enforcement , improvements to border security , and an E-verify system to make it impossible for companies to employ undocumented immigrants . Those bills largely avoid the issue of citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. , but some Republicans are flirting with the idea of legal status for immigrants .\nThe Democratic-led Senate passed its vision of immigration reform in June . That measure includes doubling the number of border patrol agents along the Mexican border to about 40,000 and providing a 13-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million in the country without papers . Republicans see this pathway as \u201c amnesty. \u201d However , the bill has been lingering in the House of Representatives for months now because of Boehner \u2019 s promise to not put a bill on the floor without a `` majority of the majority '' support .\nIn an attempt to break the impasse and keep the issue at the forefront , House Democrats , led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California , introduced their own legislation , removing the \u201c border surge \u201d in the Senate \u2019 s bill and replacing it with a bipartisan amendment that passed the House Homeland Security Committee in May . The border security bill from Rep. Michael McCaul requires that the administration draft a border plan for 90 percent apprehension of illegal border crossers in five years .\nBut from FAIR \u2019 s perspective , any of the House bills can be used a \u201c vehicle to get amnesty \u201d via a conference with the Senate legislation .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that moving forward any new immigration law that tries to improve our legal immigration system and also prevent illegal immigration will not be enforced , \u201d Williamson said .\nWhile FAIR waits for a commitment from the establishment , Alex Nowrasteh , an immigration policy analyst at libertarian think tank Cato Institute , is a bit more confident that it \u2019 s likely a no-go this year for immigration reform .\nNowrasteh said that timing is the reason , as there aren \u2019 t enough legislative days left on the calendar to pass it . There are just 15 legislative days left this year . The momentum the issue had earlier this year among lawmakers was quickly derailed by the Syrian chemical weapons crisis , NSA spying , and the recent government shutdown . Currently , the broken health-care websites and the fact that millions of Americans are losing insurance plans they would like to keep remain the focus of President Barack Obama and his administration . This , after Obama said immigration was among his top priorities , following the reopening of the federal government last month .\n\u201c Just because it doesn \u2019 t pass in 2013 does not mean it is dead in 2014 , \u201d Nowrasteh said . \u201c I think it will definitely have some legs in 2014 , especially in the early part of the year . \u201d\nLast week , Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida , one of the key Republican players in the immigration debate , said if lawmakers didn \u2019 t tackle the issue early next year then \u201c it flatlines \u201d because of the 2014 midterm election cycle .\nBut the Cato analyst said anything is possible in 2014 , especially when history shows that the 1990 Immigration Act passed the House in October ( during an election year ) and President Ronald Reagan \u2019 s 1986 \u201c amnesty \u201d act also became law in an election year .\n\u201c The notion that it \u2019 s dead because of an election year is a talking point to try and delay reform , rather than serious analysis , \u201d Nowrasteh said . \u201c A lot of Republicans are still skeptical about a path to citizenship . \u201d\nInstead , he added the House is at a point where close to half or a majority of Republicans are in favor of at least legal status for undocumented immigrants . But the leadership needs time to rally the troops and draft the language .\n\u201c They also need to figure out how much legalization they are going to do , \u201d Nowrasteh said . \u201c We expect it to be imperfect so we can debate it . \u201d\nBut according to Steven Camarota , director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies , reform is dead , whether this year or the next .\nHe , too , thinks that unless Congress schedules more legislative days such a mammoth undertaking is doomed to fail . However , Camarota believes the House will not take up immigration because they just don \u2019 t have a \u201c real appetite to do it . \u201d\n\u201c Republicans aren \u2019 t convinced that this is a politically good idea for them , \u201d he said .\nThough the polls would differ , as they show a majority of Americans favoring reform , Camarota said \u201c polling is always difficult because it depends on the questions \u2019 wording . \u201d\nAnd if polls are anything to go by , then perhaps Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida \u2019 s popularity decline this summer is a sign for Republicans to stay away from reform .\nAccording to a survey from Rasmussen , Rubio \u2019 s popularity among Republican voters dropped 10 percentage points in June to 58 percent , after his efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform .\n\u201c Republicans know their members don \u2019 t like it and that the public will fight against them [ if they block it ] , \u201d Camarota said . \u201c So there is just no appetite for it . The bottom line is , from Republicans \u2019 point of view , is focus on Obamacare . The politics is that this thing won \u2019 t pass this year or next year either . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s unless the president decides to exercise his use of executive action to stop deportations of the undocumented . Obama has already said \u2018 no \u2019 to expanding deferred action to unauthorized immigrants .\nEven if Obama changes his mind on that , Camarota said , the president will likely get pushback . Just whether it will be strong enough to stop him is another matter .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know , \u201d Camarota said . \u201c As his popularity drops his ability to maneuver on these issues drops too . \u201d\nFrank Sharry , executive director of advocacy group America \u2019 s Voice , said he isn \u2019 t buying into the idea that there aren \u2019 t enough days left for Congress to act on immigration reform .\n\u201c We just find it ridiculous that House leadership is saying they have no time when they have nothing else to do , \u201d he said in a phone interview on Tuesday . \u201c It just doesn \u2019 t strike us as credible that they don \u2019 t have enough time . \u201d\nRather , Sharry said action on comprehensive immigration reform is a matter of Republicans \u2019 will versus the number of days on their calendar .\n\u201c Maybe they don \u2019 t have enough time for whatever they are cooking up in the back room , \u201d he said . \u201c We want them to take floor votes before the end of the year . They have time . There is broad public support in favor of reform . It \u2019 s in the economic interest of the country . It \u2019 s in the political interest of the party . They just need to act rationally . At some point the Republican Party has to decide if they are going to let the minority in the party be the tail that wags the dog . \u201d", "But to most of the rest of the world , she 's Marie Yovanovitch , the career diplomat caught up in the blizzard of headlines about Ukraine and President Donald Trump 's possible impeachment .\nUntil a few months ago , she was the tough-minded U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , living in the embassy in Kyiv with her mother Nadia and her dog Scout , she said in a 2017 interview .\nNow , she 's telling her story about being smeared and threatened to millions of Americans watching the House impeachment hearings on television .\nYovanovitch has served under the past six administrations -- both Republican and Democrat -- and won high praise , including the Senior Foreign Service Performance Award six times and the State Department 's Superior Honor Award five times . She was nominated to be U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia by George W. Bush and to Ukraine by Barack Obama .\nBut earlier this year , Yovanovitch was attacked in conservative media and by Ukraine 's former public prosecutor , who accused her of giving him a `` do not prosecute '' list and blocking him from traveling to the U.S. to investigate Democrats after she publicly criticized the country 's lack of progress in tackling corruption .\n( MORE : Former Ukraine ambassador felt threatened , told to 'watch my back ' : Deposition )\nThe State Department and U.S. embassy went on record to deny the allegations , and the prosecutor later recanted them . But Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have repeated them , and they may have influenced Trump 's decision to recall Yovanovitch early from her post in May .\nShe learned only in late September , when the White House released a memo of Trump 's now infamous July 25 with Ukraine 's president , that the president called her `` bad news , '' saying she was `` going to go through some things . ''\nSince then , Yovanovitch , who just turned 61 , indeed , has been going through `` some things . ''\nStill an active Foreign Service officer , she 's been teaching at Georgetown University while the scandal unfolded across Washington -- her name , her photo , and the accusations , coming up repeatedly in news accounts and on television .\nShe was heralded as a hero when she complied with a House subpoena in defiance of the White House -- the first current administration official to do so -- marching to Capitol Hill on Oct. 11 to speak to House impeachment investigators behind closed doors .\nShe learned about being a survivor from her parents , whom she credits as teaching her the values of `` freedom and democracy the U.S . represents . ''\nThey emigrated to North America in the 1940s -- fleeing Nazi and communist regimes in Europe . Young Masha grew up in Kent , Connecticut , according to The Middletown Press , where her parents taught foreign languages at a private boarding school .\n`` My parents survived poverty , war , and displacement , '' she said at her confirmation hearing in 2016 . `` They finally arrived in the United States with me in tow in search of freedom , accountability , and opportunity , the very values that Ukrainians demanded in the revolution of dignity . ''\n( MORE : Former ambassador to Ukraine says Trump had her removed based on 'false claims ' )\nShe told a Connecticut newspaper in 2005 that she first thought about working abroad when she was in school but did n't pursue it until years later , after studying in Moscow and working in advertising in New York . She joined the Foreign Service in 1986 .", "Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn \u2019 t want to impeach President Donald Trump , but a growing number of her members are trying to drag her there .\nDespite repeated pronouncements from the California Democrat that she doesn \u2019 t want to try to remove Trump from office \u2014 including taking a hard line in a series of tense leadership meetings Monday night \u2014 Pelosi faces increasing calls from her rank and file to trigger an impeachment inquiry .\n`` It 's time to start , '' said Rep. Joaquin Castro ( D-Texas ) , a member of the House Intelligence Committee .\nIn an effort to mollify the growing pro-impeachment faction , Pelosi will hold a special members-only meeting Wednesday morning to fully brief lawmakers on House Democrats \u2019 sprawling oversight efforts and investigations .\n`` Speaker Pelosi strongly encourages your boss to attend , '' read a notice sent to members from her office late Tuesday , adding that the meeting would focus on `` the great '' victory Democrats won Monday regarding Trump 's financial records and `` other litigation . ''\nThe members-only huddle is Pelosi 's latest attempt to keep her caucus in line as the White House continues to fuel the conflict with the new House majority over its investigations and more Democrats speak out in favor of impeachment .\nTrump on Tuesday blocked his former White House counsel from testifying in a highly anticipated House Judiciary Committee hearing . Lawmakers on the panel , which has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings , said former White House counsel Don McGahn 's no-show was an `` inflection point '' in their thinking about what should happen next .\n`` I \u2019 m not saying this as the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus , '' said Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( D-Wash. ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee backing the push to open an impeachment inquiry .\n`` There are actually a lot of frontline members who are coming up to me and saying ... ' A situation in which the president and the administration can completely , not just undermine , but actually destroy the foundations of checks and balances is something we can \u2019 t live with . ' ''\nStill , there were some signs late Tuesday that Pelosi 's attempt to buttress leadership 's posture against impeachment was working .\nRep. Steve Cohen , a member of the Judiciary Committee , said he has drafted articles of impeachment and they 're `` ready to go . '' But the Tennessee Democrat later said that without Pelosi 's backing , `` it 's not going to happen . ''\nAnd Rep. David Cicilline ( D-R.I. ) , one of the members of Pelosi \u2019 s own leadership team who pressed her on impeachment Monday night , was also taking a much more subdued approach on Tuesday .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t a decision that gets to be made by me , \u201d Cicilline said . \u201c We recognize that the speaker will make that judgment , and I fully support her , obviously . \u201d\nThe shift in tone comes after a remarkable few hours on Monday night when Pelosi and other top Democrats clashed with fellow members of the Democratic leadership team \u2014 including Cicilline \u2014 who pushed to begin impeachment proceedings . And the relative calm may be short-lived as House Democrats and the White House both opened new fronts in their ongoing war Tuesday .\nThe Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for two former administration aides \u2014 Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson \u2014 likely setting up another legal battle with Trump . House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff received a last-ditch attempt from the Justice Department to stave off a likely vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for a second time .\nTrump also moved to appeal a Monday court ruling requiring his accounting firm to turn over eight years ' worth of his financial records to the House Oversight Committee .\n`` I don \u2019 t know what the president \u2019 s lawyers have up their sleeve . I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen . I \u2019 m just going to play it day by day , '' Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings ( D-Md . ) , said . `` I have not been running around declaring victory . I just want to do my job . I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen . ''\nAnd Democrats are increasingly frustrated with their inability to secure testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller , who is so far wary of testifying .\nCalls for moving toward impeachment surfaced in multiple closed-door meetings Monday , as frustrated members of the Judiciary Committee and other rank-and-file Democrats vented about the White House \u2019 s repeated stonewalling of their investigations and urged Pelosi to begin the impeachment process .\n\u201c Yes , we do need to start an inquiry , \u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon ( D-Pa. ) , one of several members of Judiciary who sharpened her stance his week .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re at an inflection point . We \u2019 re no longer dealing with a president who obstructed the Mueller inquiry . He \u2019 s now obstructing Congress at every turn including telling witnesses who no longer work for the government that they can not speak about public documents , \u201d Scanlon said .\nBut at an emergency private meeting later Monday night , Pelosi rejected calls from House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry , according to multiple sources . Nadler was also instructed to tell members of the panel not to bring up the notion of an impeachment inquiry at the panel \u2019 s high-profile hearing Tuesday , which McGahn skipped , defying a Democratic subpoena .\nAnd not all Judiciary members are on board with opening an impeachment inquiry . Rep. Lucy McBath ( D-Ga. ) hails from a Republican-leaning district and said she worries about the politics of the committee 's Trump investigation every day .\n`` I don \u2019 t take joy in this process at all , and I \u2019 m in great angst over this , '' McBath said . `` Nobody wants to see that we \u2019 re thinking about impeaching the leader of the free world . I don \u2019 t want to have to do that. ``\nMcBath said the committee should stay focused on efforts to win subpoena fights in court \u2014 a push that got a boost Monday when a federal judge ruled that Congress has broad latitude to investigate the president , even without opening an impeachment inquiry .\nReps. Lou Correa ( D-Calif. ) and Zoe Lofgren ( D-Calif. ) similarly suggested that Congress should stay its current course and not immediately pursue impeachment .\nThe issue did not come up at the caucus \u2019 hour-long meeting Tuesday morning , which focused on the Trump administration \u2019 s heightened tensions with Iran .\nBut with McGahn defying Democrats , impeachment was on the minds of many rank-and-file members \u2014 several of whom said they were warming to the idea of moving toward impeachment .\n\u201c A couple of more moves like that latest is probably going to push me over . And I don \u2019 t celebrate it , it \u2019 s not something that makes me happy , \u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D-Mo . ) said .\nNadler stopped short of endorsing an impeachment push at Tuesday 's empty-chair hearing with McGahn . But he vowed to take action in response .\n\u201c We will hold this president accountable , one way or the other , \u201d Nadler said .\nKey members of leadership are also backing the speaker , who worries any impeachment push would distract from the party \u2019 s agenda and could backfire politically .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear to anybody who \u2019 s paying attention . We \u2019 re in the majority because of ... [ members ] who did not run on impeachment , did not run on collusion , did not run on obstruction of justice , \u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries ( D-N.Y. ) said .\n\u201c That remains the North Star for the overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus , \u201d he said .\nOther Pelosi allies insisted any movement toward impeachment was mostly contained to the Judiciary Committee .\n\u201c Judiciary members may be intense . But I fully support Nancy Pelosi where she is right now , \u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell ( D-Mich. ) said . \u201c We also have to deliver on prescription drugs and infrastructure , and a partisan impeachment would tear this country apart . \u201d\nCORRECTION : This story is updated to correct Rep.

( Joshua Roberts/REUTERS )\nIt \u2019 s only Tuesday , and it feels like a full week already . The biggest obstacle to the U.S. House of Representatives impeaching President Trump is Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and she \u2019 s refusing to budge ; the Russians cooked up even more ambitious plans to stir up racial hostility in the United States ; and another account from an Obama administration official that suggests Jim Comey exaggerates and stretches the truth when he wants to make himself look good .\nThe Rampart Blocking the Impeachment of Trump Is . . . Nancy Pelosi ?\nAt this rate , Nancy Pelosi is going to regret winning the House of Representatives in 2018 :\nReps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island , Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Joe Neguse of Colorado \u2014 all members of Democratic leadership \u2014 pushed to begin impeachment proceedings during a leadership meeting in Pelosi \u2019 s office , said the sources . Pelosi and Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut , Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico , Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Cheri Bustos of Illinois \u2014 some of her key allies \u2014 rejected their calls , saying Democrats \u2019 message is being drowned out by the fight over possibly impeaching Trump . Raskin \u2014 a former law professor \u2014 said he wasn \u2019 t advocating impeaching Trump but suggested that opening an impeachment inquiry would strengthen their legal position while allowing Democrats to move forward with their legislative agenda . Pelosi dismissed this argument , asking Raskin whether he wanted to shut down the other five committees working on Trump investigations in favor of the Judiciary Committee . \u201c You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home ? \u201d Pelosi quipped , referring to the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee .\nThese little anecdotes are reassuring , because they indicate to those of us on the right that Democrats don \u2019 t keep all of their condescension , self-righteousness , sneers , disdain , and contempt stored up to use on us . No , this is just how they talk to everyone , including each other . According to Politico , Steve Cohen basically called Pelosi a coward to her face .\nDuring the Steering and Policy Committee meeting , Cohen said President Bill Clinton faced impeachment proceedings \u201c over sex \u201d while Trump is \u201c raping the country , \u201d according to two sources in the room . Cohen later confirmed his remarks . Pelosi pushed back on Cohen during the meeting and his assertion that she was simply afraid impeachment would cost her the House majority . \u201c This isn \u2019 t about politics at all . It \u2019 s about patriotism . It \u2019 s about the strength we need to have to see things through , \u201d Pelosi said , according to an aide in the room .\nCohen \u2019 s not alone . One of President Obama \u2019 s old HUD guys , Brandon Friedman , is out there proclaiming , \u201c Democrats were sold a bill of goods by Pelosi : Vote for us so we can become the majority and hold Trump accountable . When voters did that , the argument became , \u2018 We can \u2019 t hold Trump accountable because it could jeopardize our majority ! \u2019 \u201d\nWhat happens to Pelosi when she \u2019 s opposed by the pro-impeachment Left and the anti-impeachment Right ?\nNew Papers : Russians Wanted to Create African-American Separatist Group for Sabotage\nThis month turned out a good time to be focus on Russian disinformation . NBC News offers a new look at some of the ambitions of the Russians at the Internet Research Agency , beyond the 2016 U.S. elections :\nThe documents \u2014 communications between associates of Yevgeny Prigozhin , a Kremlin-linked oligarch indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for previous influence operations against the U.S. \u2014 laid out a new plot to manipulate and radicalize African-Americans . The documents contained proposals for several ways to further exacerbate racial discord in the future , including a suggestion to recruit African-Americans and transport them to camps in Africa \u201c for combat prep and training in sabotage. \u201d Those recruits would then be sent back to America to foment violence and work to establish a pan-African state in the Southern U.S. , including South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana . There is no indication that the plan \u2014 which is light on details \u2014 was ever put into action , but it offers a fresh example of the mindset around Russian efforts to sow discord in the U.S .\nOne aspect of the mindset it reveals is that ethno-nationalists think everyone else sees the world in ethno-nationalist terms .\nThere are roughly 47 million African-Americans in the United States . No doubt somewhere in that mix you could find some who be attracted to the idea of a pan-African state spread across five southern states . I \u2019 m not African-American and shouldn \u2019 t presume to know how every member of this group would react . But I suspect quite a few would think , \u201c Wait , why would I want that ? I already have a country . I \u2019 ve already put a lot into building my life in this country . We put a lot of blood , sweat and tears into ending separate but equal , particularly in those five states ! Why would I want to create my own separate country through violence instead of trying to change and improve the one I \u2019 m in ? \u201d\nAlso note that while the Russians were discussing this idea , they were also promoting the secession of Texas and other Southern states through the Facebook group \u201c Heart of Texas. \u201d No doubt , they would love to see the United States paralyzed by warring internal factions , each refusing to compromise and attempting to break away .\nA key point in my talk is that when you \u2019 re trying to differentiate between foreign disinformation or propaganda efforts and genuine homegrown political activism , foreign disinformation rarely focuses on any solutions , and when they do , it \u2019 s the most extreme option .\nA significant portion of the IRA \u2019 s efforts targeted African-Americans and focused on the issue of police brutality and shootings . The examples of Philando Castile , Eric Garner , and Walter Scott make clear that when African Americans face an encounter with the police , they have reason to fear that even the smallest misunderstanding or misstep could have unjust and deadly consequences . But most African-Americans deeply upset about this are thinking about the best way to address it . More African-American police officers ? A country where every cop wears a body camera ? Federal civil-rights prosecutions , as seen in South Carolina ? More police training ? Some mix of all of these ?\nWhat you haven \u2019 t heard is African-Americans declaring that the appropriate response is to form their own country .\nOne of my big points in my talk last week was that the Russians at the Internet Research Agency had only studied American culture from a distance . They \u2019 re trying to manipulate us , but they don \u2019 t really understand us \u2014 and as a result , their efforts are going to be a little clumsy , heavy-handed , and not quite sound right to American ears .\nOne last point : In addition to his ties to the Internet Research Agency , Yevgeny Prigozhin is also tied to the Wagner Group . Depending upon who you ask , the Wagner group is a private military contractor like Blackwater , or an off-the-books army of Vladimir Putin , deploying to places like Ukraine , Syria , Libya , Sudan , and perhaps Venezuela .\nA murky aura persists around Wagner and the man who is thought to own it . A balding 57-year-old who often manages to be photographed scowling , Yevgeny Prigozhin is an example of how people close to Putin build their wealth \u2014 and then are deployed as useful tools . He was a little-known restaurateur until he appeared in Putin \u2019 s orbit in the early 2000s and began serving the autocrat during visits by foreign dignitaries . Prigozhin became a powerful businessman as he received a steady stream of catering contracts from the state . Often referred to in the local press as \u201c Putin \u2019 s chef , \u201d he is now seen as a key member of Putin \u2019 s inner circle .\nThese perks come with strings attached , according to Stephen Blank , a Russia expert who has been researching the Wagner Group for the U.S , Army War College . He sees Prigozhin as an example of how Putin has weaponized Russia \u2019 s wealthy elites . \u201c They \u2019 re subordinate to the state , and they keep their money and their positions on the condition that they serve the state , \u201d he said .\nLoretta Lynch : I Never Wanted to Create the Federal Bureau of Matters\nRemember Jim Comey \u2019 s anecdote of attorney general Loretta Lynch telling him to refer the investigation of Hillary Clinton as a \u201c matter \u201d and not as and \u201c investigation \u201d ?\nFor what it \u2019 s worth , Lynch says it didn \u2019 t happen the way Comey described :\nQ : Are you familiar with his \u2014 I think he \u2019 s testified to this \u2014 that you instructed , I believe in September of 2015 , Director Comey to call the Midyear Exam investigation a matter ? Lynch : I heard his testimony on it and that was the first time that he had ever indicated to me , in my understanding \u2014 he may have told 17 others \u2014 that he had that impression of our conversation . Q : So you do not believe you ever instructed him to call it a matter ? Lynch : I did not . I have never instructed a witness as to what to say specifically . Never have , never will\u2026 I didn \u2019 t direct anyone to use specific phraseology . When the Director asked me how to best to handle that , I said : What I have been saying is we have received a referral and we are working on the matter , working on the issue , or we have all the resources we need to handle the matter , handle the issue . So that was the suggestion that I made to him .\nOh , come on . What are the odds that Jim Comey would exaggerate or stretch the truth a little to create a story that paints him as the last honest man in Washington ?\nADDENDUM : In case you missed it late yesterday , ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro , who took over running the network in March 2018 , told the Los Angeles Times , \u201c Without question our data tells us our fans do not want us to cover politics .

Her main competitor in the race is not Senator Sanders , these critics say , but Vice President Biden . They argue that she made a serious error in pandering to the left , pulled there in part by her sister , Maya Harris , her progressive campaign chairwoman .\nSenator Harris has supported liberal causes such as Medicare for All , the Green New Deal , and the decriminalization of sex work , and she has indicated an openness to reparations for slavery , as well as having a \u201c conversation \u201d about voting rights for violent felons . In several cases , she \u2019 s later had to walk back her comments or try to clarify .\nIt is a pattern similar to her record on some issues in California , when she changed positions on the death penalty and stepped back from her controversial policy to punish parents for their children \u2019 s truancy , which resulted in a few parents going to jail .\nDavid Axelrod , a former top adviser to President Obama , has criticized Senator Harris for being overly cautious in answering questions \u2013 trying to have things both ways .

No one can turn that back , not Mr. Trump or anyone else , '' Rouhani said at a ceremony at Tehran University marking the start of the university academic year , according to state media .\n`` Even if 10 other Trumps are created in the world , these are not reversible . ''\nTrump , who has called the pact an `` embarrassment '' and `` the worst deal ever negotiated '' , has been weighing whether the deal serves U.S. security interests as he faces the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms .\nThe prospect of Washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it , especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis , North Korea 's nuclear and ballistic missile development .\nIf Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance , the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal . U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms .\nRouhani said Saturday that if the United States violated the deal then it would hurt its own reputation in the international community .\n`` If America carries out any violations today , the whole world will condemn America .

Key events in Egypt \u2019 s uprising and unrest\nAfter a night of clashes that claimed at least 36 lives and injured more than 200 , both sides appeared to be preparing for the possibility of more violence as Egypt 's political unraveling increasingly left little room for middle ground or dialogue . Only a fraction of Cairo 's normally heavy traffic was on the streets amid worries that violence could flare up again .\nSecurity forces stepped up their presence near the largest concentration of Morsi supporters on the streets : A sit-in outside a mosque in Cairo 's eastern Nasr City district , a traditionally Muslim Brotherhood stronghold .\nIn Nasr City lines of fighters brandished homemade weapons and body armor at road blocks affixed with Morsi 's picture .\nNext door in the relatively upscale Heliopolis district , people chanted against Morsi and honked car horns in appreciation of roadblocks manned by Egypt 's military -- whose snub of Morsi 's authority earlier this week tipped the scales against Egypt 's first elected leader .\nIn a further sign of the concern the unrest could spin out of control , Mansour , held talks with the army chief and Defense Minister Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sissi as well as Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim .\nIt was the first time Mansour has worked out of the president 's main offices since he was sworn-in Thursday as the country 's interim leader .\nMansour also met with leaders of Tamrod , or Rebel , the youth movement that organized the mass anti-Morsi demonstrations , according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity .\nGunmen shot dead a Christian priest Saturday while he shopped for food in an outdoor market in the northern Sinai Peninsula Saturday .\nIt was not immediately clear if the shooting was linked to the political crisis , but there has been a backlash against Christians since just before and after Morsi 's ouster . Attacks have occurred on members of the minority by Islamists in at least three provinces south of Egypt . Morsi 's Brotherhood and hard-line allies claim the Christians played a big part in inciting against the ousted leader .\nOfficials have briefly detained top figures from Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood and have kept him from the public eye , under detention in an undisclosed location .\nMorsi 's supporters have vowed to take to the streets until he is reinstated . His opponents , meanwhile , have called for more mass rallies to defend what they call the `` gains of June 30 , '' a reference to the start of massive protests to call for the ouster of the president .\nThere were no reports of major clashes after dawn Saturday , following a night of street battles that added to an overall death toll of at least 75 in the past week .\nThe Interior Ministry reported that at least eight policemen have been killed since June 30 .\nThe Health Ministry official \u2019 s deputy , Khairat el-Shater , considered the most powerful figure in the organization , was arrested in a Cairo apartment along with his brother on allegations of inciting violence , Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif told The Associated Press .\nEgyptian troops reportedly opened fire on Morsi supporters Friday outside Republican Guard headquarters near Cairo , where Morsi was believed held . There were initially conflicting reports on casualties , but an army spokesman denied troops shot at Morsi supporters , saying only blanks and teargas were used .\nCrowds of Islamists gathered to cross a bridge over the Nile River after nightfall and clashed with Morsi opponents near Tahrir Square and outside the state TV building . TV images showed groups of youths running and fireworks going off near the bridge . One witness reported stone throwing and gunfire .\nIn a dramatic appearance -- his first since Morsi 's ouster -- the supreme leader of the Muslim Brotherhood defiantly vowed the president would return . `` God make Morsi victorious and bring him back to the palace , '' Mohammed Badie proclaimed from a stage before a crowd of cheering supporters at a Cairo mosque . `` We are his soldiers we defend him with our lives . ''\nBadie , who was taken into custody shortly after Morsi was ousted , addressed the military , saying it was a matter of honor for it to abide by its pledge of loyalty to the president , in what appeared to be an attempt to pull it away from its leadership that removed Morsi . `` Your leader is Morsi ... Return to the people of Egypt , '' he said . `` Your bullets are not to be fired on your sons and your own people . ''\nState prosecutors said that Morsi would face an investigation next week into claims that he `` insulted the presidency . ''\nMorsi was ousted in what was described by the presidential palace as a `` complete military coup . '' The White House has not labeled Morsi ouster a coup . Doing so would have U.S. aid implications .\nMorsi said on his presidential Facebook page that the military 's action `` presents a military coup and it is unacceptable . ''\nThe U.S. State Department condemned the violence and called on all Egyptian leaders to denounce the use of force and prevent further bloodshed among their supporters .", "On Thursday , the United States revealed that it now has `` high confidence '' that the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons against rebel forces .\nThis is a significant development because President Obama has often said that such a finding would cross a `` red line '' in the civil war that has killed at least 93,000 .\nThe big , looming question today is : Now what ? We 'll keep trying to answer that question throughout the day . But we 'll start with a rundown of the latest developments :\n-- Small Arms ? : During a press conference with reporters on Thursday , Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes would not give details as to the type of `` military support '' the United States would now provide rebels .\nQuoting `` American officials , '' The New York Times reports today that the Obama administration has decided to supply the rebels with `` small arms and ammunition . '' For now , the Times reports , the administration has not decided whether it will supply rebels with antitank weapons . The paper adds that anti-aircraft weapons are `` not under consideration . ''\n-- Less Than Expected : NPR 's Deborah Amos , who has been covering the conflict , tells Morning Edition that for the rebels , the new U.S. position is `` less than expected . ''\nThe rebels have been asking for heavy weaponry that could take on the kind of fire power Bashar Assad has .\n`` For them it 's an incremental shift , '' Deb said . They are much more focused on the upcoming battle for Aleppo .\n-- U.K. Support : Rhodes also said the United States would begin to work with the international community . Today , British Prime Minister David Cameron said they share the `` candid assessment '' by the United States .\n`` I think it , rightly , puts back center stage the question , the very difficult question to answer but nonetheless one we have got to address : what are we going to do about the fact that in our world today there is a dictatorial and brutal leader who is using chemical weapons under our noses against his own people . ''\n-- Questioning Intelligence : U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he opposes military aid to the rebels . Not only that , but he cast some doubt on the U.S. intelligence assessment that found the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons .\n`` The validity of any information on the alleged use of chemical weapons can not be ensured without convincing evidence of the chain-of-custody , '' Ban said , while calling for the on-the-ground investigation to continue .\n-- The Question Of Russia : Russia has been Assad 's most ardent supporter \u2014 on several occasions thwarting attempts by the United Nations to step into the situation . As The Telegraph reports , the Kremlin has maintained there should be no foreign intervention in Syria .\nThe paper reports that MP Alexei Pushkov , the chairman of the Russian State Duma 's international affairs committee , was unconvinced by the evidence of chemical weapons use . Pushkov said on Twitter , according to The Telegraph :\n`` Information about the use by Assad of chemical weapons has been fabricated in the same place as the lies about ( Saddam ) Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction ... Obama is taking the same path as George Bush . `` Why would Assad use ' a small quantity ' of sarin against the fighters ? What would be the point ? ! In order to give a reason for outside intervention ? There 's no logic in that . ''\n-- Diplomacy Still An Option : NPR 's Michele Kelemen reports that Secretary of State John Kerry has not given up on Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Obama are set to meet next week .\nNPR 's Deb Amos adds that this announcement by the United States comes just after the rebels suffered a significant defeat in the city of Qusair . Some worried , Deb said , that such a victory would embolden the Assad regime to walk away from the peace talks they had agreed to .\n`` This announcement appears to be an attempt to recalibrate the balance of power on the ground , but still in the service of a negotiated settlement , '' she said .\n-- A No Fly Zone : The Wall Street Journal reports that among the options for the United States is setting up a no-fly zone over Syria . The paper says :\n`` Asked by the White House to develop options for Syria , military planners have said that creating an area to train and equip rebel forces would require keeping Syrian aircraft well away from the Jordanian border . `` To do that , the military envisages creating a no-fly zone stretching up to 25 miles into Syria which would be enforced using aircraft flown from Jordanian bases and flying inside the kingdom , according to U.S . officials . ''\n-- 'Caravan Of Lies ' : Reuters reports that the Syrian Foreign Ministry called the White House statement about the use of chemical weapons a `` caravan of lies . '' The ministry also said the decision by the United States to provide military support for the rebeles reveals a `` flagrant double standard '' when it comes to how it deals with terrorism .", "New Leader Of Iraq Is Nominated , But Maliki Insists He 'll Stay In Office\nIraq 's president has asked the parliament 's deputy speaker to form a new government , after members of the Shiite coalition that had backed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki nominated the deputy , Haider al-Abadi , to the post Monday .\nThe move adds more uncertainty to a country beset by extremist militants in the north and sectarian divisions elsewhere .

The Prime Minister-designate expressed his intent to move expeditiously to form a broad-based , inclusive government capable of countering the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , and building a better future for Iraqis from all communities . The Vice President relayed President Obama 's congratulations and restated his commitment to fully support a new and inclusive Iraqi government , particularly in its fight against ISIL . The two leaders also discussed practical steps towards fully activating the bilateral Strategic Framework Agreement in all of its fields , including economic , diplomatic , and security cooperation . Prime Minister-designate Abadi thanked Vice President Biden for the call , and they agreed to stay in regular communication as the government formation process proceeds . ''\nEarlier Monday , Maliki filed a complaint against President Fuad Masum , accusing him of not asking Maliki to form a government by Sunday 's constitutional deadline . A court ruled in Maliki 's favor today \u2014 but Masum , who is Kurdish , then asked the parliament 's deputy speaker , al-Abadi , to form a government , after Abadi was nominated by other Shiite politicians to replace Maliki .\nAbadi has the support of Iraq 's National Shiite Alliance \u2014 a group that would normally include Maliki 's State of Law party , the AP reports . But Maliki is insisting that his party should decide who leads the country .\n`` Troops loyal to Maliki redeployed overnight throughout Baghdad , '' Alison Meuse reports for NPR 's Newscast unit . `` An eyewitness says there are now tanks near the president 's residence . Maliki has assumed control of most branches of the armed forces during eight years in power .

While at exactly the same time , 99 percent of all new income generated in this country is going to the top one percent . How does it happen ?

It \u2019 s still a possibility . After all , the Daily Beast is running op-eds showing how women are driving the Democratic Party \u2019 s agenda :\nMy friend Doug Sosnik has forgotten more about analyzing polling data than most of us will ever know , but he mistakes the wave for the currents in his POLITICO Magazine cover story , \u201c Blue Crush : How the left took over the Democratic Party. \u201d By focusing on ideology , Sosnik \u2019 s analysis ignores what is driving the power shift in the Democratic electorate . The reason that Democrats have achieved a consensus supporting LGBT rights , marijuana legalization and immigration reform is because they now enjoy a double-digit lead among women , especially unmarried women . The left hasn \u2019 t taken over the Democratic Party . Women have . Sosnik does write that he can \u2019 t imagine \u201c a viable Democratic presidential candidate , \u201d much less a nominee , \u201c who isn \u2019 t willing to take clear positions on \u2026 supporting women \u2019 s health and their reproductive rights , \u201d but this core value is embedded among positions on hydraulic fracking and the minimum wage . In that word salad , it \u2019 s hard to tell the side dish from the entree . Put simply , when polls show a double-digit gender gap \u2014 and women turn out \u2014 we know who \u2019 s going to win and why .\nThe Democrat \u2019 s so-called \u201c war on women \u201d has surely helped mobilize these ladies into a juggernaut of a voting bloc . So , why are Democrats shying away from their signature slogan ? The National Journal reported on July 31 that this narrative may have run its course \u2013 and that Hobby Lobby might not bring it back with a vengeance ( emphasis mine ) :\nDemocrats want to talk about `` personhood '' and reproductive freedom . They want to tell voters about a stubborn pay gap and women hurt by a low minimum wage . But what they do n't want to do is talk about a `` war on women . '' Indeed , the party that so effectively deployed the `` war '' rhetoric to help defeat Mitt Romney in 2012 has now sworn off its catch phrase , dropping it almost completely from a campaign strategy that , in so many other ways , is still very much about women 's issues . `` [ Saying ] 'Republicans are waging a war on women ' actually does n't test very well , '' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake . `` Women find it divisive , political\u2014they do n't like it . '' \u2026 `` We are on much stronger ground when we talk about the specifics than when we talk about the category , '' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman . `` And so when we talk about Republicans who want to make abortion illegal , Republicans who want to ban equal pay for equal work \u2026 the specific policy issues matter . That 's where the power is . ''\nThe Journal piece also noted that Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes , who thinks Israel \u2019 s Iron Dome protects it from underground attacks , is using Senator Mitch McConnell \u2019 s votes against the Violence Against Women Act and Equal Pay as an example of this shift in messaging strategy . At the same time , McConnell and Grimes are polling even with Kentucky women .\nNevertheless , it still means Republicans should get more aggressive in debunking these disingenuous attacks , reaching out to single women by showing we \u2019 re , amongst other things , not insensitive towards their needs , and sharpening our messaging to avoid more Todd Akin moments .\nOn the other hand , there are other voting blocs that have just as much sway in elections . But , let 's not discount that `` war on women '' tactics could return in an ugly way .", "Entering Final Primary Stretch , Clinton And Sanders Fight For A California Win\nCalifornia was n't supposed to be close .

A new survey from the Public Policy Institute of California has Clinton in a virtual tie with Bernie Sanders among Democratic primary likely voters \u2014 46 percent support Clinton while 44 percent support Sanders .\nThe Golden State , which holds its presidential primary June 7 , is a big , liberal , delegate-rich prize in what has been a long and increasingly bitter primary fight .\nAnd both candidates are fighting to win California . Clinton wrapped up a four-day swing Friday , while Sanders is in the midst of a weeklong barnstorming of the state .\nSanders pointed out recent polls with some glee at a rally in Santa Monica earlier this week . `` She 's looking very nervous lately , '' he said . `` And I do n't want to get her more nervous , so if you promise not to tell her , we 're going to win here in California . ''\nClinton , meanwhile , has been more focused on the general election than on the primary .\n`` Send a message , '' she said in San Francisco . `` Send a message to a demagogic , rhetorically divisive and dangerous candidate that when you think about the future you do n't see Donald Trump 's face up there . ''\nThe reality is , with all the superdelegates who have announced their support for Clinton and her very large lead in pledged delegates , Clinton will almost certainly clinch the nomination before the polls even close in California . So why is she competing so hard in the state ?\nIt 's all about psychology , says Jack Pitney , a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College .\n`` She wants to end the primary campaign on a high note , and losing California would end it on a low note , '' he said . `` She wins the nomination , but loses the psychological warfare to Bernie Sanders . ''\nAs Clinton has traveled the state , the reception has n't been entirely friendly .\nIn Salinas , a mix of what looked to be Trump and Sanders supporters gathered outside a Clinton event . They chanted and waved signs about her speech transcripts , email server and relatively hawkish foreign policy views .\n`` You 're either with Hillary or you 're with Trump , '' he said .\nSilva was wearing a black T-shirt with big white letters reading `` Dump Trump '' and admits he is more motivated against Trump than he is for Clinton . Silva initially supported Bernie Sanders , but now he plans to vote for Clinton in the primary .\n`` You know , I wish it would end so that all the concentration would be against Trump and the Democratic Party can unite against Trump , '' Silva said . `` That would be a big plus for the party , and I think for America . ''\nClinton needs more voters like Silva if she 's going to unite the party . She has started making that pitch in California .\n`` We , Sen. Sanders and I , our supporters together , have so much more in common together than we do with Donald Trump , '' she said in San Jose .\nEven a California loss for Clinton would n't really change the race , because she and Sanders would very likely split the state 's delegates , says Mo Elleithee , executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service . He worked on the Clinton campaign in 2008 .\n`` I think they would like to send a stronger message , '' he said , `` but at the end of the day the nomination process is about math much more than it is about momentum . Math beats momentum every time . ''\nThat 's probably not what Sanders and his supporters will be saying heading into the July Democratic convention if he is able to pull off a win in California . A Golden State victory would be a big part of Sanders argument to superdelegates that they should flip and support him .", "A divided appeals court panel sided Friday with Ohio business owners who challenged the birth control mandate under the new federal health care law .\nThe business owners are two brothers , Francis and Philip M. Gilardi , who own Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney , Ohio. , and challenged the mandate on religious grounds . They say the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees . The law already exempts houses of worship from the requirement .\nThe ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is one of several on the birth control issue , which likely will be resolved by the Supreme Court . There are at least three other rulings by federal appeals courts on the mandate : One sided with Oklahoma businesses ; and two sided with the Obama administration in challenges brought by Pennsylvania and Michigan companies .\nWriting for the majority , Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote that the mandate `` trammels the right of free exercise -- a right that lies at the core of our constitutional liberties -- as protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . ''\nBrown , an appointee of President George W. Bush , said that the mandate presented the Gilardis with a `` Hobson 's choice : They can either abide by the sacred tenets of their faith , pay a penalty of over $ 14 million , and cripple the companies they have spent a lifetime building , or they become complicit in a grave moral wrong . ''\nFriday 's ruling reversed a lower court ruling that had denied the Gilardis ' request for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the mandate against them as business owners . The appeals court ruled that the lower court erred when it concluded the Gilardis were unlikely to succeed on the merits , and sent the case back to the lower court to consider other factors for an injunction .\nBut Brown upheld the lower court 's dismissal of an injunction for the brothers ' companies , writing , `` we have no basis for concluding a secular organization can exercise religion . ''\nIn an opinion dissenting from the court 's main holding in the case , Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise . He asked what , if the Gilardis ' companies were exempted from covering contraception , would stop another company from seeking an exemption from a requirement to cover vaccines ?\n`` The mandate does not require the Gilardis to encourage Freshway 's employees to use contraceptives any more directly than they do by authorizing Freshway to pay wages , '' wrote Edwards , who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter . He added that the Gilardis remain free to publicly express their disapproval of contraceptives .\nComing from the other direction , Judge A. Raymond Randolph joined Brown 's main conclusion about the Gilardis but dissented from her conclusions about Freshway companies ' exercise of religion .\n`` Why limit the free-exercise right to religious organizations when many business corporations adhere to religious dogma ? '' asked Randolph , an appointee of President George H.W . Bush . `` If non-religious organizations do not have free-exercise rights , why do non-religious natural persons ( atheists , for example ) possess them ? ''\nThe Gilardis ' lawyer , Francis Manion , senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice , an anti-abortion legal group that focuses on constitutional law , said he was pleased that the court accepted the `` bulk '' of his arguments , but will appeal the part of the ruling on the free exercise religious rights of corporations .\n`` It 's a big victory , but not total , '' he said in a telephone interview .\nIn a statement , the Rev . Barry W. Lynn , executive director of Americans United , a church-state watchdog group , said the Friday 's ruling turns `` the concept of religious freedom on its head .\n`` Religious liberty means the right to make decisions for yourself , not other people , '' Lynn said . `` Freedom of religion should never be a blank check to meddle in the personal medical decisions of others . ''\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it was unable to comment on pending litigation .", "Colorado baker Jack Phillips received a standing ovation Saturday at the Western Conservative Summit , which came as a change of pace after a week of protests and negative reviews following his Supreme Court victory .\nSince the high court ruled Monday in his favor , the owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood has been faced with protesters and a deluge of one-star reviews on Yelp , but he \u2019 s not complaining .\nFar from it . \u201c It \u2019 s been quite a week , but God is so good , \u201d Mr. Phillips told the friendly crowd at the Colorado Convention Center .\nHe thanked those at the annual \u201c rally on the right \u201d hosted by the Centennial Institute who supported him during the six-year court fight over his refusal to create a wedding cake for a gay marriage ceremony .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve heard my faith described as despicable and my efforts to defend my religious freedom have been compared to Nazis , \u201d Mr. Phillips said . \u201c And I \u2019 m profoundly grateful that the court saw the injustice that our state government inflicted on me .

First , and foremost , the Supreme Court itself has long been as divided as the country itself . Split 4-4 with a conservative-leaning swing voter \u2014 Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 as a frequent tiebreaker , in Scalia 's absence the court is left in a dead heat in areas ranging from affirmative action to union dues to abortion .\nScalia was a critical part of the 5-4 conservative majority in a litany of major cases . However , it is the division in the Senate that could produce the next constitutional crisis . Faced with a refusal of the Republican senators to move forward with a nominee for the court in the last year of the Obama Administration , President Obama could use the nuclear option : a recess appointment to the Supreme Court .\nUnder Article II of the U.S. Constitution a president is allowed to temporarily fill vacancies that \u201c may happen during the Recess of the Senate. \u201d I have long been a critic of recess appointments to the judiciary . While far less common than appointments to the Executive Branch , such appointments have occurred historically ( including 12 to the Supreme Court ) .Yet judicial recess appointments undermine the integrity of the courts by using the equivalent of a judicial temp for a position that was meant to be held by a jurist with lifetime tenure .\nThe framers wanted a president and the Senate to come to an accord on such appointments , including the need to compromise to achieve such goals . Obama , however , made it clear years ago that he was willing to go it alone when Congress failed to give him legislation or confirmations that he demanded . His unilateral actions have already produced a constitutional crisis over the fundamental guarantees of the separation of powers . This includes a unanimous 2014 decision of the Supreme Court that Obama violated the recess appointments clause in his circumvention of the Senate .\nFor a president who has shown a tendency to \u201c go it alone \u201d when denied action by Congress , a recess appointment may prove an irresistible temptation for Obama . The Republican leadership has already signaled that it has no intention of moving forward with such a nomination , objecting that ( in 80 years ) no president has moved such a nomination within his final year in office . While there is ample time to vote on a nominee , the president could make an appointment if his nominee is denied or if his nominee is left to languish in the Senate Judiciary Committee .\nThe Republicans may have unnecessarily tripped the wire by saying that they would not move forward on a nomination as opposed to slow walking and rejecting a nomination . The failure to even consider the nominee could give the president the rationale for a recess appointment . Ironically , the justice who tended to favor executive assertions of power and limit the ability of Congress to challenge such assertions was Antonin Scalia .\nThe president could claim that his power is in full effect with the current recess of the Senate . He could also claim such authority with the end of the annual session . Generally , the authority to make a recess appointment has been recognized with a recess of greater than three days . The Senate can avoid that trigger by remaining in technical session with little or no business being transacted . That could push the target recess to the end of the session where Obama would make the appointment before the next Congress assembles in January \u2014 an appointment made in literally the waning days of his term .\nI happen to think Obama is well within his rights to make the nomination . As hockey great Wayne Gretzky said , you miss every shot that you never take . And this is a shot most presidents would take . If blocked , however , Obama should recognize that a new president will enter office in a matter of months ( or weeks with an end-of-session appointment ) with a national mandate . Such a decision would undermine the integrity of the court with a display of raw muscle by a departing president . It would cement Obama \u2019 s troubling legacy as a president who waged an unrelenting campaign against the separation of powers that is the foundation of our constitutional system . The difference between a statesman and a politician is often the exercise of restraint . It is not enough to say that you can do something , but whether you should do something . This is something Obama should not do .\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588 's board of contributors .

Wade . But with mounting attacks on abortion rights and the most conservative Supreme Court in modern history , states across the country have spent the 47th year of Roe scrambling to protect a women \u2019 s right to choose in the increasingly plausible event that the historic court decision is soon overturned .\n\u201c The reality is that the balance of the Supreme Court is not in our favor , \u201d says Bonyen Lee-Gilmore , who works on state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood , adding , \u201c We have to be prepared [ if ] Roe falls . That \u2019 s just part of the reality of living under the Trump administration . \u201d\nThe effort began exactly one year ago , when New York became the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its state law , effectively codifying Roe v. Wade . ( The law also ended New York \u2019 s ban on abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy . ) Since then , Illinois , Rhode Island , and Vermont have all passed similar laws protecting the right to an abortion . Michigan , New Jersey , and the District of Columbia are also looking at codifying the right to an abortion . In 2019 , statehouses passed more legislation protecting or expanding abortion access than in the entire previous decade .\nHowever , in the aftermath of the confirmation of two staunchly conservative justices to the Supreme Court in 2018 , red states have been doing the opposite kind of preparation for a post-Roe world . In 2019 , four states\u2014Arkansas , Kentucky , Missouri , and Tennessee\u2014passed legislation known as trigger laws , which would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturned Roe , and 12 states passed abortion bans . In total , eight states now have trigger laws on the books , and 20 have laws that could be used to restrict the right to an abortion if Roe were overturned .\n\u201c States are going in widely divergent directions when it comes to both abortion rights and abortion access , \u201d says Andrea Miller , president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health . \u201c We have a group of states last year that were tripping over each other in a race to the bottom to try to ban abortion outright , and then we also had a real record year on the other side . \u201d\nAccording to Planned Parenthood , roughly 25 million women of reproductive age live in a state where abortion could be banned if Roe is overturned . Millions more are already forced to jump through hoops to access abortions , including 72-hour waiting periods , mandatory counseling , and invasive ultrasound procedures .\nIn March , the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since the confirmation of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch . The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law , which requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals , a stipulation that opponents of the bill argue would leave the state with only one provider for a population of more than 4.5 million . Although the justices are not expected to overturn Roe outright in this case , legal experts argue that if the court were to rule in favor of the law , access to abortion in states like Louisiana could exist in name only .", "Washington ( CNN ) Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight .\nRoberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race .\nAppeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by Roberts .\nAppointed to the bench by President George W. Bush , Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . He dissented in United States v. Windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples . And he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans .\nYet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice , and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again .\n`` If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court , '' said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage . `` Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? ''\nFor some conservatives , a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter , who was nominated to the bench by George H.W . Bush and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy , a Ronald Reagan appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority .\nThe hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts .\n`` The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution , '' said Edward Whelan , president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center . `` Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice . ''\nThose hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case .\nIn his majority opinion , Kennedy said the `` principal purpose '' of the Defense of Marriage Act was to `` impose inequality . ''\nRoberts disagreed . He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide `` uniformity and stability '' at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman .\nRoberts picked up on Kennedy 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday `` come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions . ''\nDavid Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case .\n`` Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage , '' Cruz said .\nIndeed , the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan , Tennessee , Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage .\nAnother clue to Roberts ' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton , who signed it into law .\n`` I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , '' Roberts wrote .\nThe comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people .\nBut backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own .\nSchaeffer points out that Roberts did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage do n't violate the Constitution .\n`` Roberts did n't join them in expressing those views , '' Schaeffer said .\nAt the time , Roberts simply wrote that the court `` does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide '' whether states can ban same-sex marriage .\nSchaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that was n't before the court .\n`` But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality , '' she said .\nThe Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage .\nThe case concerned a challenge to California 's Proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage . But Roberts , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court .\nThe ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California . Roberts ' lesbian cousin , who lives in California , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case .\nFew people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans .\nOn the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue . Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases . But conventional wisdom was completely wrong .\nWithout comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages .\nThe court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known . But some speculate on one possible scenario : Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor .\nThen again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about Roberts ' thinking . There 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits .\nAnd even when Roberts ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking .\n`` When the institution of marriage developed historically , people did n't get around and say , 'Let 's have this institution , but let 's keep out homosexuals , ' `` Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments . `` The institution developed to serve purposes that , by their nature , did n't include homosexual couples . ''", "Cam Newton finds himself in a no-win situation on matters of race these days , something he mentioned on Wednesday when asked about the shooting death of Charlotte-area resident Keith Lamont Scott by police .\n\u201c I \u2019 m in a position now where if I say something , it \u2019 s going to be critiqued , \u201d the Carolina Panthers quarterback said , \u201c and if I don \u2019 t say something , then I \u2019 m flawed . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s right \u2014 both sides can parse Newton \u2019 s words any way they want , and he typically is a lightning rod for criticism no matter what he says . After being open on some racial issues in the past , he has become more reserved and guarded most recently . The GQ interview that came out in August shocked many when Newton essentially said that America didn \u2019 t have a race problem .\nOn Wednesday , he did , however , offer his candid ( if not carefully chosen ) thoughts about what was happening in his community \u2014 a shooting death that has grabbed the national spotlight .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a firm believer of justice and a firm believer of doing the right thing , and I can \u2019 t repeat enough about just holding people accountable , \u201d Newton said . \u201c I \u2019 m an African-American . I am not happy with how justice has been kind of dealt with over the years .\n\u201c But we also , as black people , have to do right by ourselves . We can \u2019 t be hypocrites . I say that on one voice and also another voice that when you go public , or when things happen in the community , it \u2019 s not the fact that things are happening ; it \u2019 s the way they \u2019 re being treated after they \u2019 re happening . \u201d\nNewton cut to the core of what a lot people are wondering : Are police officers treated the same way by the justice system when it comes to bringing charges and/or convicting police offers who kill civilians , as a civilian would if he was the one holding the gun ?\nBeyond that , Newton touched on the effects of such a shooting , something that hit home for him as a father .\n\u201c When you get a person that \u2019 s doing unjust things or killing an innocent person or killing fathers , or killing people who have actual families , that \u2019 s real . I have a son and a daughter that I \u2019 m responsible for . So how would I be if one day they come home and there \u2019 s no more daddy ? \u201d\nBut before you read this as Newton judging the case before it \u2019 s been tried , he was sure to make note that he didn \u2019 t have enough information yet on the Scott shooting to say who was right and wrong . And this case , although it involves a police officer killing a black citizen , might not be like other stories promulgated in the recent news cycle in that the officer was black and that Charlotte police have claimed Scott was armed and warned multiple times to stand down , even if some witness accounts didn \u2019 t indicate that the victim made any threatening gestures .\nCam Newton \u2019 s right about one thing : Voicing opinions can be a lose-lose proposition for him . And he \u2019 s clearly playing for the tie today . \u2014 Darin Gantt ( @ daringantt ) September 21 , 2016\nStill , Newton isn \u2019 t completely sitting on the sideline on this story and is lending his voice \u2014 and his position \u2014 he says to help make a difference .\n\u201c I want to bring unity , and football gives me that opportunity , \u201d Newton said .", "It \u2019 s increasingly obvious that the Democratic Party is moribund and that its members know it . In a desperate attempt to survive , they have declared war on a chimera called \u201c racism , \u201d which they insist is endemic to American culture . Left-wing Democrats call centrist members of their own caucus racist for voting their conscience . Freshman Democrats accuse the Speaker of the House of racism for requesting that they behave with decorum . All Democrats insist that all Republicans are racists while attributing all GOP election victories to racial gerrymandering , racist voters , or both . And every Republican president is racist by definition \u2014 particularly if his surname is Trump .\nMeanwhile , in order to signal that they are also on the side of the angels in this epic battle against bigotry , the \u201c news \u201d media wield their mighty pens on behalf of the noble cause . A textbook example of the assistance they offer to \u201c the party of Jefferson and Jackson \u201d can be found in a recent New Republic column titled \u201c Trump and His Deplorables. \u201d Its author , Matt Ford , begins by praising Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 observation that \u201c you could put half of Trump \u2019 s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. \u201d He then goes on to tell his readers that Clinton \u2019 s cavalier condemnation of 30 million voters was a highly nuanced argument whose wisdom has long since been vindicated :\nTwo years into Trump \u2019 s presidency , \u201c deplorable \u201d seems almost kind . It \u2019 s clear by now that racism is an animating force of Trump \u2019 s presidency , yet many of Trump \u2019 s supporters and most of the Republican Party still back him after every bigoted slight and discriminatory policy he makes . They may not be willing to admit that they agree outright with everything he says or does , but their continued political support makes the distinction meaningless .\nThe problem with this passage isn \u2019 t merely that it is gratuitously defamatory and demonstrably false , but that it tends to reinforce the sense of moral superiority that defines \u201c progressives \u201d like Ford and the politicians who actually take them seriously . It creates a positive feedback loop that allows both to justify outrageous behavior that neither would consider without mutual encouragement . It permits journalists to delegitimize those who disagree with them about Trump and also permits Democratic lawmakers to take the floor in the House of Representatives and accuse the president of racism \u2014 knowing full well that doing so violates a decades-old parliamentary rule .\nThis brings us to the question that very few have bothered to ask about Trump \u2019 s Sunday morning tweet storm : Was it actually racist ? I didn \u2019 t bother to read the tweets when they first appeared . Nor was I moved to do so in response to the subsequent uproar . Everything the president says or does is instantly denounced by the Democrats and their media allies as racist , cruel , crazy , or crass . So it just sounded like another day at the office for Trump . I finally got around to reading them today and fail to see the catalogue of crimes his critics claim to see . Not that mere facts matter to the Democrats or the social justice warriors of today \u2019 s media , as Goldie Taylor makes clear in the Daily Beast :\nThe president is a racist \u2026 On Sunday , he claimed that newly elected progressive Democrats \u201c originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe \u201d and \u201c the worst , more corrupt and inept anywhere in the world. \u201d And he told freshmen Reps. Ayanna Pressley , Rashida Tlaib , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar \u2014 outspoken Democratic women of color who have challenged the administration \u2019 s inhumane immigration policies \u2014 to leave the country .\nBut he didn \u2019 t do anything of the sort . First , none of the tweets contain any reference to the race of any congressional representative . Not a single , solitary syllable . So , how precisely can Taylor honestly denounce them as racist ? Moreover , it is by no means clear that he is referring to all four of the congresswomen she names . He pluralizes some words for general effect just as I do with \u201c journalists \u201d in paragraph four above , but this is hardly definitive . The tweets are obviously about Ilhan Omar , a Somali immigrant who routinely gripes about the \u201c racism , cruelty , and injustice \u201d of her adopted country , and throws in the occasional anti-Semitic slur to just to keep the pot bubbling .\nIn fact , her anti-Semitic comments caused so much uproar last February that considerable pressure was put on the Democratic majority in the House to pass a resolution condemning her comments . But Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , the same Democrat representative who violated the rules of that body in order to call the president a \u201c racist , \u201d could not muster the votes to get it passed . Instead , the Democrats passed a generic resolution against hate speech that not only failed to mention Omar \u2019 s name , but also failed to mention anti-Semitism . As a clearly angry Rep. Liz Cheney put it , \u201c I voted against the Democrats \u2019 sham resolution \u2014 it was designed to protect anti-Semitic bigotry . \u201d\nThe very Democrats who covered for a brazen anti-Semitic bigot would have us believe they are outraged by the president \u2019 s \u201c racist \u201d tweets . None of this is about racism or bigotry . It \u2019 s about a dying animal called the Democratic Party , hatred for the man administering the lethal injection , and the voters who support him . As Goldie Taylor says , \u201c Trump Is a Racist . If You Still Support Him , So Are You. \u201d As it happens , the House held a vote Wednesday afternoon to impeach the president . It failed 332 to 95 . The increasingly shrill cries of racism are just the death throes of a political party that reviles the United States , President Trump , and the voters they can no longer fool .", "When Nelson Mandela died last month , I envied South Africans who had worked alongside him for freedom : Americans haven \u2019 t gotten to see many of our icons of justice get that old . My immediate thought was of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , assassinated at 39 , though Bobby and John Kennedy , Malcolm X and Medgar Evers , quickly followed .\nBut the inescapable image was King . Even if the freedom struggle of the 1960s didn \u2019 t end up letting King grow old like Mandela , let alone lead his country as president , it was hard not to compare the two , especially since Mandela so often declared his debt to his younger American ally .\nKing and Mandela had much in common , but one thing stands out this week : As they were lionized globally , both were deradicalized , pasteurized and homogenized , made safe for mass consumption . Each was in favor of a radical redistribution of global wealth . Each crusaded against poverty and inequality and war . Both did it with an equanimity and ebullience and capacity to forgive and love their enemies that made it easy to canonize them in a secular way . White people love being given the benefit of the doubt and/or being forgiven . I speak from experience .\nBut now , as the country turns again to issues of income inequality and poverty , and economic populism is said to be having a \u201c moment , \u201d maybe it \u2019 s time to remember Dr. King , the radical . The one who died trying to ignite a Poor People \u2019 s Movement that he saw as the natural outcome of the civil rights movement . The one who tried to branch out to fight poverty and war , but at least in his lifetime \u2013 and so far in ours \u2013 did n't succeed .\nI loved pretty much everything about the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington last year , except how the right got it so wrong . It seemed to be the beginning of a movement to reclaim the real MLK , especially among liberals . King was of course celebrated hugely , but so were lefty heroes who never get enough credit , like Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph . There were stories about \u201c The Socialists Behind the March on Washington , \u201d as well as about the media \u2019 s and the Kennedy administration \u2019 s wrongheaded fears of violence .\nComing off of that gorgeous 50th anniversary celebration , though , where we remembered the triumph of King the strategist and organizer , let \u2019 s remember the King who tried and , by common measures , failed . Was n't feted , wasn \u2019 t lionized . King was always a radical , but at the end of his life , he was something of an outcast , criticized by liberals , the left and the right .\nForget about the right , for now : King crossed some Democrats and labor leaders when he turned against the Vietnam War in 1967 , after his unparalleled Riverside Church speech . He knew the war was not only wrong , but was making Johnson 's alleged `` War on Poverty '' fiscally impossible . Meanwhile a growing black power movement mocked King 's commitment to nonviolence and integration . Even some close allies in the civil rights movement blanched when he joined Marion Wright Edelman and other organizers to start a Poor People \u2019 s Campaign later that year \u2013 a movement of black , white , Latino , American Indian and Asian people mired in poverty , to fight the war and get the help they deserved . They were to march on Washington and set up a camp there in April 1968 , the month King was assassinated .\nHarry Belafonte tells a story in his amazing memoir , \u201c My Song , \u201d about King being challenged by his SCLC deputies on his accelerating radicalism generally , and the Poor People \u2019 s Campaign specifically , just a week before he died . Describing King as a \u201c socialist and revolutionary thinker , \u201d Belafonte says he clashed with close ally and future Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador Andrew Young , over not only the Poor People \u2019 s Campaign , but King \u2019 s thoroughgoing critique of capitalism . Belafonte quotes King telling the group , gathered at the singer/actor/activist \u2019 s New York apartment : \u201c What deeply troubles me now is that for all the steps we \u2019 ve taken toward integration , I \u2019 ve come to believe that we are integrating into a burning house . \u201d\nWhen Belafonte asks what that means they should do , an exhausted King tells him : \u201c I guess we \u2019 re just going to have to become firemen . \u201d\nAssassinated a week later , King wouldn \u2019 t get to lead the Poor People \u2019 s Campaign . But almost 50 years later , most of us who think the way he did are still firemen in a burning house , constantly fighting the fires set by radical Republicans to make life worse for the people King cared most about , never getting around to building the sturdy , welcoming , capacious , fire-resistant dwelling that lives in our political imagination . King would be proud of our accomplishments , and also a little bit sad for us . Or maybe I 'm just projecting .\nSome of King \u2019 s closest living allies have been trying hard to right the reverend 's record . \u201c There have been and continue to be efforts to \u2018 neuter \u2019 or \u2018 de-radicalize \u2019 the Dr. King who delivered his ' I Have a Dream ' speech in August , 1963 , \u201d says his longtime lawyer and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones . Though the dream speech , which Jones helped write , was itself radical , he sees King \u2019 s April 1967 \u201c Beyond Vietnam : Time to Break the Silence \u201d speech at Riverside Church as \u201c the ideological turning point for King . \u201d\nHarry Belafonte likewise thinks much of American political culture \u201c is guilty of dealing with Dr. King \u2019 s life and story in grievously superficial ways . What gave us all strength to do what we did was his radical thinking. \u201d Acknowledging that King \u2019 s turn against the war and toward cross-racial , anti-poverty organizing was \u201c controversial \u201d among his closest colleagues , Belafonte notes : \u201c It was controversial , but controversy wasn \u2019 t something he shunned ; controversy became the system through which disagreement and debate could be heard . He was comfortable with that . He welcomed it . That aspect of his history is never really discussed .\n`` The vested interests don \u2019 t want us speaking of Dr. King in radical terms , '' Belafonte continues . `` The great tragedy and irony of it all is that the public hungers for voices that are driven more by these moral concerns . \u201d\nI \u2019 ve never waded into the debates over whether King was a \u201c socialist , \u201d though Belafonte and another close ally Julian Bond say he was ( to the chagrin of Glenn Beck , who of course tried to hijack the March on Washington anniversary a few years back ) . Socialism has been such a stigmatized and divisive and practically irrelevant notion in my lifetime ( even though I worked for a socialist newspaper ! ) that I 've never needed to claim King for its roster . But whatever we call King 's point of view , stripping him of his very obvious economic radicalism distorts not only his history but all of ours .\nAnd as a younger generation shows more curiosity about political solutions that aren \u2019 t on the agenda , it may limit King \u2019 s appeal , too . A 2011 Pew poll found 49 percent of Americans 18 to 29 say they have a positive view of socialism vs. 43 percent with a negative view . Capitalism is underwater among that age group , with 46 percent positive and 47 percent negative . And here 's one of King 's most famous , resonant quotes about capitalism , from his August 1967 speech : `` Where Do We Go From Here ? '' ( I like this version , because it 's punctuated by his SCLC audience 's replies ) :\nI want to say to you as I move to my conclusion , as we talk about `` Where do we go from here ? '' that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society . ( Yes ) There are forty million poor people here , and one day we must ask the question , `` Why are there forty million poor people in America ? '' And when you begin to ask that question , you are raising a question about the economic system , about a broader distribution of wealth . When you ask that question , you begin to question the capitalistic economy . ( Yes ) And I 'm simply saying that more and more , we 've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society . We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life 's marketplace . ( Yes ) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring . ( All right ) It means that questions must be raised . And you see , my friends , when you deal with this you begin to ask the question , `` Who owns the oil ? '' ( Yes ) You begin to ask the question , `` Who owns the iron ore ? '' ( Yes ) You begin to ask the question , `` Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that 's two-thirds water ? '' ( All right ) These are words that must be said . ( All right ) Now , do n't think you have me in a bind today . I 'm not talking about communism . What I 'm talking about is far beyond communism . ( Yeah ) My inspiration did n't come from Karl Marx ( Speak ) ; my inspiration did n't come from Engels ; my inspiration did n't come from Trotsky ; my inspiration did n't come from Lenin . Yes , I read Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital a long time ago ( Well ) , and I saw that maybe Marx did n't follow Hegel enough . ( All right ) He took his dialectics , but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism . And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach , and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called `` dialectical materialism . '' ( Speak ) I have to reject that . What I 'm saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual . ( Yes ) Capitalism forgets that life is social . ( Yes , Go ahead ) And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism , but in a higher synthesis . ( Speak ) [ applause ] It is found in a higher synthesis ( Come on ) that combines the truths of both . ( Yes ) Now , when I say questioning the whole society , it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism , the problem of economic exploitation , and the problem of war are all tied together . ( All right ) These are the triple evils that are interrelated .\nLabels don \u2019 t matter , but solutions do . Rather than remembering King solely as a civil rights leader , we must reclaim him as a radical advocate of economic justice , looking to lead a multiracial movement of poor people to complete the unfinished business of the civil rights movement . As King put it plainly , \u201c What good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can \u2019 t buy a hamburger ? \u201d Post-integration , too many black people couldn \u2019 t sit down at integrated lunch counters and buy a hamburger ; 50 years later , too many people of every race have the same problem .\nWe are ready for the radical King now . President Obama , perhaps belatedly , has declared income inequality `` the defining issue of our time . '' Even poverty seems back on the agenda . The man who may be doing the most to advance these issues right now is n't a politician or a rabble rouser ; it 's Pope Francis , who 's been hailed by everyone from Obama to Paul Ryan ( Ryan gets him wrong ) as helping us make the issue of poverty central to our politics . `` If Dr. King were alive today , he would be in Rome visiting Pope Francis holding a joint press conference to summoning the world to aid the poor eradicate poverty , '' Clarence Jones says . The president promises he 's going to the Vatican to meet the new pope , and that 's a start .\nFor now , though , all these years later , King 's allies and inheritors are still fighting fires in a burning house . It 's time to rebuild the house with room for everyone , and keep it safer from the fiery danger of injustice .", "The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has bestowed its blessing on cancel culture\u2013the twisted phenomenon whereby universities and public libraries cancel scheduled events just because someone claims to be offended . In Nova Scotia , cancel culture has spread to personalized license plates . Justice Darlene Jamieson ruled on January 31 , 2020 , that one anonymous complaint about Lorne Grabher \u2019 s personalized \u201c GRABHER \u201d license plate was enough to warrant its permanent cancellation . The Court affirmed the January 2017 decision to cancel the plate which the Grabher family had used for over 25 years , because Mr. Grabher \u2019 s surname could be \u201c misinterpreted \u201d as a \u201c socially unacceptable slogan . \u201d\nLorne Grabher is of Austrian-German heritage . His family immigrated to Canada from Europe in 1906 . His father served in the Canadian Armed Forces , and was stationed in Cape Breton , Nova Scotia . The family \u2019 s history , including their name and the heritage it signifies , is important to the Grabher family . In or around 1990 the Grabher family applied for the \u201c GRABHER \u201d plate , originally a gift to Lorne \u2019 s father and later used by Lorne \u2019 s son . For 27 consecutive years , through three generations of Grabhers , the Registrar authorized the plate for use on the family \u2019 s motor vehicles in Nova Scotia . Each year the Registrar of Motor Vehicles renewed the plate without issue .\nAll it took to wreck this noble family tradition was one anonymous complaint to the Registrar , in October of 2016 . Without taking into account the Grabher family \u2019 s pride in its Austrian-German heritage , and ignoring all prior decisions to renew the plate year after year after year , Janice Harland of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles told Lorne Grabher : \u201c While I recognize this plate was issued as your last name , the public can not be expected to know this and can misinterpret it as a socially unacceptable slogan . \u201d\nFor Lorne Grabher , this case is about more than a personalized plate . It \u2019 s about his family \u2019 s name , personal dignity , and the ongoing insult by the Nova Scotia government in its censorship of the plate .\nJustice Darlene Jamieson has effectively equated Lorne Grabher \u2019 s surname with EATASS , FOQME , HOTCOK , BLOWJB , BRDSHT , FSTFK , FCKPIG , 8CUNT , DCHBAG , GNGBNG , FQUALL and other objectionable terms on the Banned List of words that are prohibited by the Nova Scotia Registrar of Motor Vehicles . The court was not moved by the double standard of foul language used by another government entity , the Halifax Water Board , whose bus ads included the phrases \u201c Powerful Sh * t \u201d and \u201c Be proud of your Dingle. \u201d The court also deemed irrelevant the existence of Canadian place names like \u201c Dildo , Newfoundland , \u201d \u201c Swastika , Ontario , \u201d \u201c Red Indian Lake , Newfoundland , \u201d \u201c Crotch Lake , Ontario , \u201d \u201c Old Squaw Islands , Nunavut , \u201d and \u201c Cape Negro \u201d in Nova Scotia .\nJustice Jamieson relied heavily on a report by Carrie Rentschler ( https : //www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people-contacts/faculty/rentschler ) a McGill University professor of \u201c feminist media studies \u201d who specializes in things like \u201c the construction of new political subjectivities , \u201d \u201c emergent forms of social collectivity , \u201d and \u201c the shape and practice of contemporary feminisms in social media networks and hashtag publics . \u201d\nProfessor Rentschler argued that the \u201c GRABHER \u201d license plate supports or increases violence against women ; that exposure to cultural slogans normalizes sexual violence against women ; that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate creates an elevated risk of rape ; and that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s surname is a statement in support of physical violence against women . As the Professor explains in her revised report :\n\u201c As an expression , the meaning of \u2018 Grabher \u2019 could be understood to signify the support , condoning and encouragement of gendered physical violence against girls and women . \u2018 Grabher \u2019 \u2013 read as \u2018 Grab her \u2019 - is a speech act that can potentially contribute to the harms of gendered violence against girls and women , \u2018 crossing over from expressive activity to threat \u2019 \u2026 As an injunction , recipients of the phrase may interpret it as encouragement to grab or grope female individuals without their consent . \u201d\nThere was no evidence before the court that there is less crime in Nova Scotia , or in Mr. Grabher \u2019 s neighborhood , since the plate was revoked . There was no evidence that anyone , including the anonymous complainant , had suffered any harm as a result of the plate .\nProfessor Rentschler claimed that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate is broadly \u201c offensive \u201d to the public , but provided no examples of any specific people or studies who find it so . Professor Rentschler is not from Nova Scotia , admitting on cross-examination that she did not know the name of the big blue ship in the background on all Nova Scotia licence plates . She provided no evidence to support her claim that the plate endangers the general public . Nor did the Nova Scotia government present any evidence to support any of Professor Renstchler \u2019 s assertions . There was no evidence that any roadway or motorist or citizen , female or male , was ever once endangered by the plate . There was therefore no evidence that the plate represents \u201c language that supports gendered violence \u201d or that the \u201c plate promotes violence against women . \u201d\nDespite the absence of evidence to support Professor Rentschler \u2019 s wild claims , Justice Jamieson actually agreed with her , ruling that \u201c the seven letters \u2018 GRABHER , \u2019 without added context to indicate this is a surname , could be interpreted as promoting sexualized violence against women and girls . \u201d\nJustice Jamieson decreed that banning Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate is justified to prevent harm , to ensure a \u201c safe and welcoming \u201d environment on Nova Scotia roads , and to protect individuals in society from the effects of offensive expression . She stated : \u201c Clearly the provincial government can not sanction having vehicles with government-owned plates travelling the highways of this province and country bearing messages that could be considered \u2018 offensive or not in good taste \u2019 . \u201d\nWhere would we be without the government to keep us safe from the scourge of peoples \u2019 offensive surnames ?\nWhat actual harm Mr. Grabher \u2019 s personalized plate had caused from 1990 to 2017 was not explained by the Court , nor could the Registrar of Motor Vehicles point to any harm . The Nova Scotia government suggested the GRABHER plate hurt tourism , but the government \u2019 s witness , Peter Hackett , later admitted that there was no such evidence .\nThe Registrar provided no evidence on behalf of the person who complained , why that person complained , or even whether she or he resided in Nova Scotia . The Registrar treated an ethnically German name as an English phrase , and then attached an idiosyncratic and demeaning reading to it . Mr. Grabher \u2019 s claim of discrimination against Canadians of Austrian-German heritage was dismissed because , according to Justice Jamieson , persons of Austrian-German heritage do not suffer from any \u201c pre-existing disadvantage or stereotyping in Canadian society. \u201d Essentially : discrimination is only wrong if you belong to the right group .\nThe court minimized the hurt and humiliation experienced by Mr. Grabher in the past three years , claiming that he is \u201c free \u201d to \u201c choose another personalized plate consisting of up to seven letters or numbers . As Justice Jamieson explained it : \u201c He is not denied access to personalized plates , but solely access to the seven-letter , personalized \u201c GRABHER \u201d plate. \u201d This \u201c freedom \u201d is rather worthless because no other expression on the plate would communicate the same idea as the family surname . If you can not say what you want , there is no free expression . For a court to say \u201c no worries , you are allowed to say other things \u201d misses the whole point of free expression .\nCancel culture panders to the fragile snowflakes who file anonymous complaints . Their desire , to avoid feeling offended by their own imagination about what someone else \u2019 s last name could mean if translated into a different language and then distorted into something it is not , must take precedence over someone else \u2019 s right to display his own last name with pride .\nWhen courts promote cancel culture , they harm the free society .", "The tense situation in Ferguson , Mo. , following the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown is another test for President Obama . He has struggled at times over how to navigate long-simmering tensions between police and the African-American community .\nObama says he understands the passions and the anger that have engulfed Ferguson over the past week and a half , but he has carefully avoided taking sides . His warnings against violent confrontation have been directed equally at the protesters and the police .\n`` Ours is a nation of laws for the citizens who live under them and for the citizens who enforce them , '' he said at a news conference Monday .\nThat studied even-handedness disappoints some African-American observers . Paul Butler , who studies race and criminal justice at Georgetown Law school , wants to hear more outrage from the president about the conduct of a nearly all-white police force in a town that 's two-thirds black .\n`` With the specter of urban insurrection in an American city that looks more like Fallujah than Ferguson , this is not the time to be detached , '' he says .\nOthers , however , defended Obama 's cautious approach . Joshua Dubois , who used to head the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships , says now that the Justice Department is investigating the Ferguson shooting , it 's important that the president not appear to be putting his thumb on the scale .\n`` There are a lot of folks who want President Obama to be all sorts of things : an activist , a marcher , a poet , a race theorist . But in this case , I need him to be the president , '' Dubois says . `` I need him to make sure that this investigation is carried out in a full and fair way , and that that family and that community in Ferguson has closure in terms of the way the criminal justice system operates . ''\nA survey by the Pew Research Center finds sharp differences in the way the shooting and the police crackdown that followed are viewed by blacks and whites and Democrats and Republicans . It 's possible that a more one-sided approach from the president would simply deepen that divide . But Butler argues that 's no reason for Obama to hold back .\n`` Look , the president has his haters . And he 's always going to have his haters . I think he 's gone out of his way to try to appease them , '' Butler says . `` And that 's resulted in neglecting not just his political base , but a large sector of the American population , including African-Americans , who need his leadership on these issues . ''\nButler says he had high hopes when the first black president was elected . But Obama quickly learned the perils of speaking bluntly about race and law enforcement . Obama had been in office just six months when he was asked during a news conference about black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr . The professor had been locked out of his house and was arrested when he tried to force his way in .\n`` The Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home , '' Obama said .\nThe comment was catnip for cable TV , but the president had to backtrack just two days later : `` To the extent that my choice of words did n't illuminate but rather contributed to more media frenzy , I think that was unfortunate . ''\nObama later hosted a beer summit for the professor and the policeman . Afterward , he scarcely mentioned race for the next three years .\nUntil Trayvon Martin , the black Florida teenager who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer . `` If I had a son , he 'd look like Trayvon , '' Obama said . And while he was careful not to second-guess the Florida jury that acquitted the shooter , Obama spoke in unusually personal terms about the painful suspicions that nearly every young , black man is confronted with .\n`` There are very few African-American men in this country who have n't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping at a department store , '' he said . `` That includes me . ''\nWhile Obama has generally steered clear of programs designed exclusively for African-Americans , he did launch an initiative this year focused on the challenges of young black men . He conceded this week that there 's a lot to do .\n`` In too many communities , too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear . Through initiatives like My Brother 's Keeper , I 'm personally committed to changing both perception and reality , '' Obama said .\nObama has described the initiative as a long-term project . But observers like Lester Spence of Johns Hopkins University grow more impatient each time another young black man is killed in a place like Ferguson , Mo .\n`` I am so tired and frustrated . And I know America 's a better place than it was . But this continues to happen ? And we 've got a black guy as the president ? You 've got to be kidding me , '' Spence says .", "NEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - Thousands of protesters stormed the security perimeter of Barclays Center in New York as protests spread across the United States over the killing of George Floyd , a Minneapolis black man who died after being pinned by the neck under a white police officer \u2019 s knee .\nAn Atlanta Police car burns as people protest against the death in Minneapolis police custody of African-American man George Floyd , near CNN Center in Atlanta , Georgia , U.S. May 29 , 2020 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Dustin Chambers\nPolice made scores of arrests at Friday \u2019 s massive demonstration in Brooklyn , loading cuffed protesters onto city buses lined up on Atlantic Avenue , shutting down a major thoroughfare .\nA diverse group of protesters cheered to hip hop music and tried to argue about police brutality with police officers in riot gear , who occasionally lunged into crowds to pluck people out for arrest after bottles and other projectiles were thrown .\nThe demonstrators at a \u201c We can \u2019 t breathe \u201d vigil and rally in lower Manhattan were pressing for legislation outlawing the police \u201c chokehold \u201d used by a city police officer in the 2014 death of Eric Garner , who was also black .\nIn an impassioned speech , Bernice King , the youngest daughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. , implored people to go home after more than 1,000 protesters marched to the state capitol from the Centennial Olympic Park , blocking traffic and an interstate highway along the way .\n\u201c The only way we get what we really want is through non-violence , \u201d Bernice King said in her father \u2019 s hometown . \u201c Let \u2019 s do this the non-violent way to deal with the evil of our time . \u201d\nKing was assassinated in 1968 , a year after race riots spread across many big cities .\nThe Atlanta demonstration turned chaotic and at times violent .

If so , the GOP has an odd way of showing affection . Green cites a lack of Republican criticism of Trump , the president \u2019 s continued popularity within the party , and Trump \u2019 s rescue of incumbent Nevada senator Dean Heller from a primary challenge . All true . But when it comes to the president \u2019 s priorities and the nationalist-populist style of politics he represents , Trump and the Republican Congress could not be farther apart .\nTrump won the nomination and the presidency after distinguishing himself from the party in four ways . Since Ronald Reagan , Republicans have tended to support global economic integration , immigration , democratic internationalism , and entitlement reform . And yet Trump opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership , called to renegotiate NAFTA , and wanted tariffs on China . His 2015 immigration plan championed a wall across the southern border , workplace enforcement , an end to birthright citizenship , and a tripling of border and customs agents . He repudiated the Iraq war and questioned the future of NATO . He swore that Social Security and Medicare would be off-limits . His brashness , colorfulness , insults , willingness to transgress norms , humor , novelty , and lack of political experience separated him from the GOP pack .\nThis program and its avatar won three Great Lakes states that had been missing from the Republican column for a generation . Trump also came within striking distance in Minnesota and New Hampshire . Obviously , we do not know the exact relation between Trump \u2019 s nationalism and populism and the roughly 78,000 votes in three states that gave him an Electoral College victory . But the unexpected shape of his upset suggests that the trademark Trump issues of immigration , trade , nonintervention , and retirement security played some role both in attracting support for him and depressing turnout for Hillary Clinton .\nYet the 16 months since the election have seen the gradual , fitful , and partial regularization of Trump into the GOP that predated and opposed him . Until recently , the president and congressional leadership were aligned : They seated a justice and lower-court judges , rolled back Obama-era regulations , failed to repeal and replace Obamacare , and passed a large tax cut . Trump \u2019 s foreign policy also became more conventionally Republican . He bombed Syria , turned down his criticism of NATO , maintained a troop presence in Afghanistan despite his instincts to withdraw , and increased defense spending . The signature Trump policies \u2014 including the travel ban , exit from the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord , and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 were greeted with friendly skepticism from party elites . By the end of 2017 , one would have thought the party would change Trump more than he would change it .\nThat hasn \u2019 t happened . Instead , both Trump and the GOP seem to be reverting to form : Trump has pressed for changes to legal immigration , visited prototypes for the border wall , called for the death penalty for opioid dealers , and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as against China , amid anxiety and dissent and resistance from congressmen of his own party . Trump \u2019 s instincts and impulsiveness have driven him to re-embrace the portfolio that delivered his electoral coalition at the very moment Republicans in Congress want nothing so much as to return to their districts , publicize the tax cut , and vainly attempt to divorce their campaigns from national politics . And so we are faced with the oddity that Trump \u2019 s approval rating is creeping upward even as Democrats press their midterm advantage .\nTrump and the Republicans operate according to different hierarchies of values . To the degree that his behavior can be categorized by a single idea , Trump \u2019 s most singular policies address the question of sovereignty : Who rules ? Here , in America , the people rule , or are supposed to . Trump \u2019 s rhetoric defines the people as American citizens , regardless of racial or ethnic identity . The domestic objective of his presidency is to reassert popular control over judges , bureaucracies , and elected officials . The extent of sovereignty must be defined , which is why we have borders and require a wall to protect a porous one . And national sovereignty is important , too . That is why America must reestablish its privileges and ability to maneuver vis-\u00e0-vis multilateral institutions such as the United Nations , international agreements , and the World Trade Organization .\nIf I had to choose a guiding principle of congressional Republicans , it would be freedom . The freedom of the individual to live the life he chooses , the freedom of people and goods and services to move across borders , the freedom to work , spend , and invest as one sees fit , the freedom of people around the world to govern themselves .\nNow , sovereignty and freedom are not necessarily in conflict . They overlap , and they can move in tandem . They often have done so in American history . But one must also balance the other . A sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust , and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty . The thrust of populist politics since 2016 indicates that voters believe that the mix of sovereignty and freedom is out of whack , that national and democratic sovereignty must be upheld even if it means tighter regulation of the global economy and especially of global migration .\nA sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust , and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty .\nAt its most politically successful , the party of Trump pits miners , hard hats , farmers , soldiers , veterans , and public-safety officers against CEOs , bankers , lawyers , doctors , bureaucrats , professors , and educators . Yet none of Trump \u2019 s personal or policy decisions occasioned as much intra-party pushback , including a high-profile resignation , as the imposition of tariffs . Not only do Republicans seem largely ignorant of the fact that Donald Trump \u2019 s political instincts are better than their own , they also refuse to learn .\nThis divergence between Trump and the Republicans is apparent in the $ 1.3 trillion government-funding bill . If there is one thing every American knows about Donald Trump , it is that he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border . Yet Republican congressmen , most of whom adhere to pre-Trump views of immigration , secured only $ 1.6 billion for the project . Democrats are crowing . \u201c Democrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law , \u201d Nancy Pelosi said in a statement . \u201c The bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds. \u201d Part of the responsibility for this setback goes to Trump , who seems to have been disengaged from the negotiations until the last minute . But the main reason the money isn \u2019 t there is the fact that congressional leadership had neither the desire nor the stomach to fight for it .\nSomething similar has happened with trade . Whatever the economic consequences of Trump \u2019 s protectionism \u2014 and they could be bad \u2014 it can not be denied that this is the issue on which he has been most consistent over 30 years in the public eye . Nor can the political appeal of siding with domestic manufacturers over multinational corporations be ignored by anyone who has seen Democrats rhetorically position themselves on the side of the American worker since 1992 . By dividing trades and construction-union membership against leadership in 2016 , Trump called forth the Reagan Democrats who had vanished from the scene , and convinced millions of white working-class voters to defect from the Obama coalition .\nThey can just as easily switch back , of course . When I visited the websites of the two candidates in the recent Pennsylvania special election , I was struck that it was the Democrat , rather than the Republican , who highlighted infrastructure , opioids , and protecting entitlements , three topics of keen interest to Trump voters . By neutralizing the hot-button cultural issues of guns and abortion , and highlighting Rick Saccone \u2019 s support for right-to-work and other pro-business measures , Conor Lamb reappropriated the economic program that Donald Trump used to win PA-18 by 20 points . He won \u2019 t be the last Democrat to do so .", "The reformers say they want to move the GOP beyond its Reagan-era script . 'Reform conservatives ' take on GOP\nWith the Republican Party \u2019 s establishment and tea party wings busy attacking each other , and no standard-bearer emerging for the White House , a group of intellectuals calling themselves \u201c reform conservatives \u201d are maneuvering to seize the party \u2019 s 2016 policy agenda .\nIn the process , they \u2019 ve set off a lively , intensifying debate in recent weeks over whether today \u2019 s GOP can be reformed at all .\nThe policy wonks \u2014 led by thinkers including Peter Wehner , Yuval Levin , and Ramesh Ponnuru \u2014 are circulating their economics-focused ideas with the express goal of influencing 2016 presidential contenders , and some of those potential candidates have been cautiously receptive . Rep. Paul Ryan , for instance , tweeted that their proposals are \u201c good food for thought ; \u201d Sen. Marco Rubio \u2019 s spokeswoman said he believes the ideas \u201c can ensure that the next generation of Americans have more opportunities for success \u201d ; and Indiana Gov . Mike Pence told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he has \u201c great appreciation for the efforts of reform minded conservatives . \u201d\nThe reformers say they want to move the GOP beyond its Reagan-era script of cutting taxes and shrinking government and toward a focus on what a more limited government can and should do , especially for the middle class . For the most part , they \u2019 ve shopped their ideas around informally , through private conversations and journal articles . But recently they took a more organized approach , releasing a 121-page policy manifesto called \u201c Room to Grow . \u201d\nThat move dramatically raised their profiles \u2014 and drew out the skeptics .\nConservative columnist Michael Gerson has praised the group , arguing it has \u201c more potential influence \u201d than the tea party . But liberal critics , such as columnists E.J . Dionne and Jonathan Chait , have questioned how effective the reformists can be at a time when the Republican Party has expunged many of its moderates and the base is animated by the notion that government is always a problem . Some observers , meanwhile , compare them to the New Democrats of the 1990s , a parallel the intellectuals resist .\nThe reform conservatives argue there \u2019 s no need to lure the GOP to the middle and no desire to further splinter it . ( They \u2019 re not even sure who came up with their group \u2019 s label , though Gerson has used the phrase , or a version of it , for at least two years . ) If anything , they say , their ideas would \u201c reform \u201d broken institutions by pushing them to the right .\n\u201c It is a conservative movement , and it \u2019 s important to understand that , \u201d said Wehner , a former policy adviser to ex-President George W. Bush . \u201c It \u2019 s not a fight . It \u2019 s not Goldwater vs. Rockefeller . \u201d\nThe e-book manifesto , released in May at an event sponsored by the YG Network and the American Enterprise Institute , lays out proposals from around a dozen authors on 10 wide-ranging issues , including replacing Obamacare , helping the long-term unemployed , and rewriting War on Poverty programs .\nIt avoids divisive cultural issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage , steering a careful path around anything that could offend social conservatives . But it does include this implied challenge to the tea party : \u201c Rather than talk about conservatism exclusively as a set of rules about what government should not be doing , we need to help Americans see the conservative vision of American life as a way to unleash the nation \u2019 s potential . \u201d\nSome critical details are still being worked out , like how to pay for some of the ideas . A chapter on tax reform , for example , talks up Utah Sen. Mike Lee \u2019 s proposal to give families an extra $ 2,500 tax credit per child and advertises it as a way to help parents struggling with the cost of raising kids . But an analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that Lee \u2019 s idea would add $ 2.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years .\nThe reform conservatives note that the ideas are mere blueprints for now . The main point , they say , is to show how conservative proposals can be turned into policies to help the middle class , not just recycled into the usual talking points about cutting taxes and slashing spending .\n\u201c Middle class families aren \u2019 t worried about their tax burden , \u201d said Reihan Salam , a policy adviser at the YG Network and contributing editor at National Review . \u201c They \u2019 re worried about how much it costs to own and operate a car . They \u2019 re worried about finding decent post-secondary [ education ] options . \u201d\nLevin , who edits the conservative journal National Affairs , put it more bluntly : \u201c The left always thinks it \u2019 s 1965 . The right always thinks it \u2019 s 1981 . The country knows it \u2019 s 2014 . \u201d", "Controversies in Wisconsin and Georgia show how the mass removal of voters from the rolls has become a key part of the fight to win\nThe final weeks of December may have been dominated by news of Donald Trump \u2019 s impeachment , but another development with potentially serious implications for the 2020 election \u2013 and the future of American democracy \u2013 attracted less global attention .\nIt took place not in the halls of Congress but hundreds of miles away , in Wisconsin . This was where a conservative advocacy group convinced a circuit court judge to order the state to remove more than 230,000 people removed from the state \u2019 s voter rolls . Wisconsin was already considered a crucial swing state in 2020 \u2013 bearing in mind that Donald Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016 . More than half of the voters at risk of being purged lived in areas that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump that year , according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel .\nTop Trump adviser : Republicans have 'always ' relied on voter suppression Read more\nA week later , one of Trump \u2019 s reelection advisers was caught on tape telling a Wisconsin Republicans that the party has \u201c traditionally \u201d relied on voter suppression . \u201c Traditionally it \u2019 s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places . Let \u2019 s start protecting our voters . We know where they are , \u201d the adviser , Justin Clark , said in audio obtained by the Associated Press . \u201c Let \u2019 s start playing offense a little bit . That \u2019 s what you \u2019 re going to see in 2020 . It \u2019 s going to be a much bigger program , a much more aggressive program , a much better-funded program . \u201d\nThere was now even less doubt that the Republicans intended to rely on both encouraging , and discouraging , voters as a key part of their 2020 election strategy .\nWisconsin wasn \u2019 t the only state where removing voters from the rolls en-masse came under scrutiny . The same week , in Georgia , the state voted to remove more than 300,000 people from the rolls . 120,000 of those people were removed because they hadn \u2019 t voted since 2012 and also failed to respond to multiple notices from the state asking them to confirm their address . The removals drew national outcry in a state that has been at the epicenter of accusations of voter suppression .\nIn 2017 the then secretary of state , Brian Kemp , removed more 500,000 from voter rolls and a month before the Gubernatorial election in 2018 he held up registrations of 53,000 under the state \u2019 s \u201c exact match \u201d law where a misplaced hyphen or comma in a voter registration record could mean more obstacles for someone to vote . Brian Kemp stood in that election and defeated Stacy Abrams by just 55,000 votes . Abrams later called Kemp a \u201c remarkable architect of voter suppression \u201d .\nThe controversies in Wisconsin and Georgia underscore how the mass removal of voters from the rolls \u2013 often called voter purging \u2013 has moved to the center of the polarized fight over voting rights in the United States . Although there is a consensus that purging , done carefully , is a useful tool to keep voting rolls accurate and remove people who move and die , there is growing alarm over how aggressively it is being used to penalize people , essentially , for not voting .\nOverall , at least 17 million people have been removed from the voter rolls since the 2016 election , an uptick from the number of voters who were removed between 2006 and 2008 , according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice . Although it \u2019 s not known how many of those removals were legitimate , the increase comes even as the number of Americans who move has dropped to historic lows .\n\u201c Folks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout , \u201d said Stuart Naifeh , an attorney at Demos who was involved in a high-profile voter purge case at the United States supreme court last year . Voter purges \u201c is one that seems to have become more popular . \u201d\nPurging is not new \u2013 federal law has required it for more than two decades \u2013 but there is a new awareness of how purges can remove eligible voters from the rolls and target populations that move a lot : the young , the poor and people who live in cities , all groups that tend to favor Democrats .\n\u201c It \u2019 s only bad when it \u2019 s done poorly . When it captures people who are still in the state or who are still eligible voters and shouldn \u2019 t be removed , \u201d said David Becker , the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research , who works with states cleaning their voter rolls .\nMyrna P\u00e9rez , director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice , pointed out that there used to be an important tool to keep voting jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination from \u201c bad \u201d purges : the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act . Until 2013 , if a state covered by the law wanted to make a change in its purge process , it would have to show the federal government that it wasn \u2019 t to the detriment of minority voters .\nThe oversight helped prevent both discriminatory purge practices and allowed states to catch errors in their methodology , Perez said . But it was lifted in 2013 when the supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act . When the law was still in full effect , P\u00e9rez said , \u201c it had the effect of stalling and stopping intentional and accidental sloppiness . \u201d\nAnother legal blow came in 2018 , when the supreme court ruled in favor of a controversial way of carrying out purges .\nFolks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout Stuart Naifeh\nThe case involved Larry Harmon , a software engineer in Ohio , who sued the state when he discovered in 2015 that , after sitting out several elections , he was unable to vote on a marijuana initiative because he had been purged . If someone misses a federal election in Ohio , the state sends them a postcard asking them to confirm their address . If they don \u2019 t respond to the postcard and fail to vote in two more consecutive elections , they are removed from the rolls . Voting rights groups call the Ohio rule the \u201c use it or lose it \u201d law .\nHarmon argued that he was being punished for not voting , which is prohibited by federal law . And critics said that linking one \u2019 s ability to stay on the voter rolls to one \u2019 s ability to vote can discriminate against people who face more obstacles getting to the polls , such as those who can \u2019 t get childcare or time off from work . But in a 5-4 ruling , the supreme court said the process was legal because Harmon wasn \u2019 t removed solely for not voting \u2013 he had also received the postcard .\nThe ruling \u201c opened the floodgates \u201d to aggressive voter purging , said Kathy Culliton-Gonzalez , a voting rights attorney .\nMailers and postcards are a controversial way of asking voters to confirm their voter registration . In 2018 , states reported sending more than 21 million address confirmation notices and only around 20 % of them were returned , according to federal data . The fact that so few people return the postcards signals that they \u2019 re not really a reliable way of assessing whether people have moved , voting advocates argue .\nBut voter purges are more than just a question of lapsed bureaucracy , they are now emerging as a new political battleground .\nIn Ohio , for instance , Democrats and Republicans have overseen voter purges for two decades , but recently , the practice seems to have clearly benefited Republicans . Voters in Democratic neighborhoods in the state \u2019 s three largest counties were struck from the rolls at nearly twice the rate as voters in Republican ones , according to a 2016 Reuters analysis . In largely African American neighborhoods in Cincinnati , over 10 % of voters were purged , compared to just 4 % in the suburbs .\nEarlier this year , Ohio purged 158,000 voters from its rolls using that process , according to an analysis by the Columbus Dispatch . The removals came even after activists in the state discovered around 40,000 errors on the list of voters set to be purged . Oklahoma , which employs a similar purge process to Ohio and Georgia , also removed more than 88,000 inactive voters from its rolls in April .\nEven so , there has been some recent successes in stopping unfair purges . Earlier this year , voting groups successfully blocked an Indiana law that would have allowed the state to cancel a voter registration if they had information the voter moved , but without giving the voter a chance to confirm that . Civil rights groups also stopped Texas from cancelling voter registrations of nearly 100,000 people it accused of being non-citizens based on faulty data .\nIn Wisconsin , election officials have declined to move ahead with the purge while an appeal is pending . The Wisconsin Democratic party has also pledged to contact voters and urge them to re-register ( the state allows people to register online , through their local clerk , or at the polls on election day . )\nDo black people vote ? The racist lie rooted in the American psyche | Rashawn Ray Read more\nAnd in Georgia , there has been another victory \u2013 of sorts . Earlier this month , Brad Raffensperger , Georgia \u2019 s top election official , announced he made a mistake . Days after his office scrubbed 300,000 people from its voter rolls , he revealed 22,000 of them had been incorrectly removed . The voters should have been given several more months to confirm their voter registration .\nRaffensperger said he was reactivating their voter registrations to give them more time . \u201c We are proactively taking additional steps to prevent any confusion come the day of the election , \u201d he said in a statement .\nSome crucial protections against bad voter purging also remain in place . Federal law prohibits states from systematically cleaning their rolls within 90 days of a federal election and says the systems state develop to remove people from the rolls must be \u201c non-discriminatory . \u201d\nIt is clear that next year \u2019 s election is already becoming an epic battle to try and preserve the voting rights of millions of voters . The lessons from the 2016 election should sound a cautionary tale .\nAs Professor Carol Anderson , author of One Person , No Vote , a history of voting suppression in the US , writing in \u2588\u2588\u2588 , said : \u201c The 21st century is littered with the bodies of black votes . In 2016 , pummeled by voter suppression in more than 30 states , the black voter turnout plummeted by seven percentage points . For the GOP , that was an effective kill rate . For America , it was a lethal assault on democracy . \u201d", "There is a unique uncertainty overshadowing the political landscape these days \u2013 an anomaly that few are willing to discuss .\nAs the 2016 presidential election inches closer , social media is oddly quieter than usual when it comes to possible candidates . The millennial generation , ever so eager to share their opinion , suddenly lacks one to voice .\nAs the generation \u2019 s charismatic leader , President Barack Obama , prepares to leave office , one thing has quickly become evident \u2013 the political alliances of millennials are officially up for grabs .\nFor the past seven years , millennials have been passionately steadfast in their support of marriage equality . That passion coincided with the Democrat Party platform , immediately giving supporters of marriage equality a political party to support .\nMake no mistake , for the majority of millennials , social issues such as the legalization of gay marriage and ( to a lesser extent ) abortions are the strongest attachments they have with the Democrat Party . Now that gay marriage is legal in every state , many are now left apathetic towards the political landscape without any direct loyalty to the Democrat Party .\nAside from the support of gay marriage , millennials are all across the board when it comes to their views . Don \u2019 t believe me ? Take a look at what a recent Reason Foundation poll found among millennials :\nThey desire small government so long as budget cuts don \u2019 t directly impact them .\nThey loathe political parties , but give Congress higher approval ratings than any other generation .\nThey overwhelmingly supported Obama \u2019 s promise of universal health care , yet greatly oppose Obamacare .\n. They want the government to fix their problems , but they don \u2019 t want Washington to be in charge .\nConfused by those results ? So are the leaders of political parties \u2013 thus the lack of a push to actively engage the generation . Not only that , but neither party has found a candidate they believe they can successfully sell to millennials .\nSo how can one party lock down the majority of millennials ?\nIt comes down to one thing , really \u2013 start a conversation . Millennials want to be a part of something , from gay marriage to the World Cup . Surprisingly , it is the Republican Party that , when completely stripped to its bare bones , has exactly what millennials want to rally behind\u2026\nWhile the past eight years saw a push to tax the wealthy and \u201c redistribute the wealth , \u201d it is amazing to see that the millennial generation feels otherwise . Don \u2019 t misconstrue that statement ; this generation will gladly rally around a movement to raise money to help those in need , but they don \u2019 t want to be told how and where to do so .\nDon \u2019 t let the media fool you - millennials desire freedom to pursue their passions , start their own companies or simply to enjoy life without Washington telling them what to do . They like their wealth , and they want to do with it as they desire .\nThey don \u2019 t want the government telling them how to spend their money .\nThey don \u2019 t want the government telling them who they can marry .\nThey don \u2019 t want the government telling them how they are to use their bodies .\nThey don \u2019 t want the government to control them , they want freedom .\nTake away the topic of gay marriage and the pro-life/pro-choice debate , and millennials desire exactly what is at the heart of the GOP \u2013 limited government .\nThe political affiliations of the millennial generation are officially up for grabs . If the Republican Party can learn how to successfully create a conversation centered around limited government , 2016 \u2019 s political landscape may quickly become more red than any of us could anticipate .\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views .

Mail-in ballots have also been a key tool in other Republican-friendly states such as Arizona and Utah .\nFor more than 40 years , Stipanovich helped Republicans win campaigns and come to dominate Florida politics . `` Absentee ballots , '' he said , `` are typically Republicans ' friends in Florida . ''\nIn 2002 , Florida began allowing anyone who requests a mail ballot to receive one , a changed Stipanovich said Republican strategists and campaign managers immediately embraced them .\n`` People recognized that was a mine of gold that you could ... control . '' He says campaign strategists could , `` figure out who got the ballots , contact them [ and ] try to make sure they got their ballots in . ''\nIn Florida , a state nearly evenly divided among Republicans , Democrats and independents , elections are often decided by the narrowest of margins . In many races , both local and statewide , mail-in ballots have provided Republican candidates with the votes to win .\nFor many years , it was Republicans who pushed voting by mail , said Daniel Smith , a political science professor at the University of Florida , who has studied how mail-in voting has been used in the state .\n`` Their electorate happens to be older on average than Democrats , happens to be more affluent . It happens to have a more permanent residency in terms of less transient , less mobile population , which makes the delivery and return of absentee ballots easier , '' said Smith .\nIn recent elections , Democratic campaigns in Florida have also begun relying on mail ballots . They allow campaign staffers to know who 's received a ballot , so they can call and encourage the voters to return it .\nCampaigns also know when people have returned their ballots , enabling operatives to `` focus their attention on less reliable voters , '' said Smith , `` who may not vote in every election and need a little more cajoling to get out to the polls . ''\nThat strategy helped Donald Trump narrowly carry Florida in 2016 , Smith said . After securing the mail-in ballots , Republicans were able to concentrate on getting their occasional voters out to the polls .\nIn Florida and elsewhere , mail ballots have been involved in election fraud , but Smith and other experts say it 's rare . A bigger problem , according to Smith , is the relatively high percentage of mail ballots that are disqualified because they arrive too late , or the voter 's signature does n't match the one on file .\nIn a study he conducted after the 2016 election in Florida , Smith found the rejections disproportionately affect minority voters and young people .\nWith two elections coming up in the next several months , a statewide primary in August and the general election in November , Florida election officials are expecting a surge of requests for mail ballots .\n`` I think every county in Florida is gearing up on that , '' said Bill Cowles , the election supervisor of Orange County , Fla. , which includes Orlando . `` We 're also putting pressure on our vendors , our mail houses for doing it . ''\nWith the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic , Democrats and voting right groups have been pushing for an expansion of the use of mail-in ballots . Some Republicans , including the governors of Nebraska , New Hampshire and Ohio , have also backed major expansions of mail-in voting in response to the pandemic .\nIn Florida , a state vital to both parties ' presidential hopes this fall , elections officials have asked Florida 's Gov . Ron DeSantis for more time to mail out and count ballots but they 've also that it wo n't be possible to conduct an all-mail ballot election this year .", "\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power .

Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d", "Democratic senators flag eight of president-elect \u2019 s picks and are pushing for more time for confirmation hearings\nIn a new era of Republican-led governance , there is little Democrats can do to prevent Donald Trump \u2019 s cabinet nominees from being confirmed . But that won \u2019 t stop them from trying .\nDemocratic senators are targeting eight of Trump \u2019 s cabinet nominees whom they view as particularly \u201c troublesome \u201d and are pushing for more time to hold hearings on each of them .\n\u201c We have asked for fair hearings on all of those nominees , \u201d the minority leader , Chuck Schumer , told reporters on Wednesday . \u201c There are a lot of questions about these nominees . \u201d\nThe nominees flagged for extra scrutiny include Steven Mnuchin , a Goldman Sachs banker turned Hollywood movie financier with no government experience , as Treasury secretary ; Rex Tillerson , who headed the biggest oil company in the world , as secretary of state , and the nominee for attorney general , Jeff Sessions , an Alabama senator who has been accused of making racially insensitive comments , which derailed his nomination to be a federal judge under Ronald Reagan .\nDemocrats have little leverage to prevent Trump \u2019 s nominees from being confirmed but they can significantly delay the process . Trump \u2019 s cabinet nominees will need 51 votes in the Senate to be confirmed and Republicans hold 52 seats .\nOn Wednesday , several Senate Democrats held private meetings with Trump nominees and later shared their initial reactions . Though all declined to say whether they would support the nominee , they signalled what the points of contention might be in the upcoming hearings .\nAfter a private meeting with Sessions on Wednesday , Dick Durbin , the second-highest ranking Senate Democrat , signalled that race and civil rights would be a key topic in his confirmation hearing next week .\n\u201c Certainly there are elements in his background that raise questions , \u201d Durbin said after their meeting , referring to allegations that Sessions was racially insensitive . \u201c He said several times , point blank , that this was not an issue as far as he was concerned . \u201d\nBeyond his past comments , Durbin said he was concerned by Sessions \u2019 views on voter ID laws and immigration . He also said he was dismayed that the Alabama Republican did not commit to following through on the recommendations outlined in a forthcoming report by the justice department \u2019 s civil rights division on the Chicago police department \u2019 s use of force .\nBefore the meeting ended , Durbin said he offered Sessions the book White Rage : The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson . \u201c I \u2019 m hoping he \u2019 ll take a look at it , \u201d he said .\nMeanwhile , Tillerson met members of the foreign relations committee on Capitol Hill on Wednesday , one week before he is scheduled to testify before them .\nSenator Chris Coons , a Democrat from Delaware , said he was \u201c generally encouraged \u201d by his conversation with Tillerson , although he said he wanted to hear more before deciding whether to support his nomination .\nSeveral senators , including Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona , have raised concerns about Tillerson \u2019 s posture towards Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin .\nCoons took issue with the confirmation schedule , saying next week seemed too soon for members to hold a hearing on Tillerson , given Republicans \u2019 current plans to also vote on repealing Barack Obama \u2019 s healthcare law .\nTo rush the confirmation process \u201c strikes me as trying to get too many things done at the same time \u201d , he said , adding that he had been up all night preparing for his meeting with Tillerson .\nThe Democrats \u2019 list also includes Scott Pruitt , a climate change denier and prospective head of the Environmental Protection Agency , Tom Price , a prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act , for secretary of health and human services , Andy Puzder , a fast food executive and critic of raising the minimum wage , as labor secretary , Congressman Mick Mulvaney , a fiscal conservative , as director of the Office of Management and Budget , and Betsy DeVos , a staunch supporter of school choice , Trump \u2019 s education secretary nominee .\nAfter a meeting with DeVos on Wednesday , Senator Patty Murray , a Democrat from Washington , said in a statement that she continued to have \u201c serious concerns \u201d about DeVos \u2019 s \u201c long record of working to privatize and defund public education , expand taxpayer-funded private school vouchers , and block accountability for charter schools , including for-profit charter schools \u201d .\nConfirmation hearings are scheduled to begin for Trump \u2019 s cabinet picks next week , with several already slated for 11 January . But before they get under way , Democrats are demanding at least two days of hearings for each cabinet nominee and have requested that they do not overlap so that members can \u201c spend a lot of time studying \u201d for them .\n\u201c I would like to succeed in negotiating something where we get full and fair hearings \u2013 we \u2019 re not trying to be dilatory \u2013 and hear what these nominees have to say , \u201d Schumer said . \u201c There are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people . \u201d\nIn response , Republicans are now accusing Democrats of obstructionism , an echo of the charge levied by Democrats against Republicans during the Obama years .\nThe majority leader , Mitch McConnell , of Kentucky , said he expected the Senate to be ready to confirm a number of Trump \u2019 s cabinet nominees shortly after Inauguration Day , on 20 January , adding that in 2009 the Senate approved seven of Barack Obama \u2019 s nominees .\n\u201c I believe all the president-elect \u2019 s cabinet appointments will be confirmed , \u201d McConnell told reporters on Wednesday , speaking before Schumer . \u201c I think it would be great if the Democrats would understand that , particularly with regard to the national security team , the secretary of defense , CIA , homeland security , it would make a lot of sense to have those folks in place on day one and I hope we \u2019 re getting to the point where that will be possible . \u201d\nSchumer scoffed at the notion of a precedent . \u201c Leader McConnell has talked about the fact that a lot of nominees were approved in President Obama \u2019 s first few days after he was inaugurated , but they all had their paperwork in early , their ethics reports , their 90-day plan to extricate themselves from conflicts , their FBI briefings , \u201d he said .\nAbsent from the list of nominees Democrats are targeting is Marine General James Mattis , Trump \u2019 s pick for defense secretary , who will need a congressional waiver to be confirmed .\nAfter meeting privately with Mattis on Capitol Hill on Wednesday , Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand , of New York , said she still opposed a waiver of the law that requires that defense secretaries be removed from the military for at least seven years .\n\u201c He has served our country admirably , \u201d Gillibrand told reporters after their meeting . \u201c He is well-regarded as an extraordinary general , and I am very grateful for that service , and I \u2019 m very grateful that he \u2019 s willing to continue his service for the president-elect . But I still believe that civilian control of our military is fundamental to the American democracy . \u201d\nThe Senate is also preparing for a pitched battle over Trump \u2019 s future choice to replace Antonin Scalia on the supreme court , which will require 60 votes .\n\u201c Apparently , there \u2019 s yet a new standard which is to not confirm a supreme court nominee at all , \u201d McConnell said on Wednesday , referring to a remark Schumer made the previous evening on MSNBC that Democrats would \u201c absolutely \u201d keep the vacancy open if the nominee were outside the mainstream . \u201c I think that \u2019 s something the American people simply will not tolerate . \u201d\n\u201c Let \u2019 s see who they nominate , \u201d Schumer told reporters . \u201c If they \u2019 re in the mainstream , we \u2019 ll give them a very careful look . If they \u2019 re out of the mainstream , we \u2019 ll oppose them tooth and nail . \u201d\nAsked how he would define mainstream , Schumer replied : \u201c You know it when you see it . \u201d\nSenate Republicans blocked Obama \u2019 s nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Scalia for more than nine months .", "Outgoing Rep.

Doug Ducey announced her appointment Tuesday morning , just days after Sen. Jon Kyl confirmed that he was stepping down from the role .\nIn the press release announcing her appointment , Ducey said that McSally `` is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for Arizona \u2019 s interests in the U.S . Senate . ''\nMcSally , a two-term congresswoman , gained national attention when she faced off against Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema this fall as they both fought to take over the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake 's decision not to run for re-election .\nSinema won the seat in a relatively close race , with Sinema winning 50 percent of the vote to McSally 's 47.6 percent . McSally conceded six days after the election .\nThat election was already a historic one , with Sinema becoming the first female to represent Arizona in the Senate . Now , the state will be one of only a few to be represented by two women .\nWith McSally 's appointment , she and Sinema will be the only serving bipartisan pair of female senators representing their state . The only other instance of that happening was in New Hampshire from 2011 to 2017 .\nThere are several other pairs of female senators who will be in the Senate come 2019 -- in California , New Hampshire , Minnesota and Nevada -- but the Arizona duo are the only ones of opposite parties .\nSix-term Republican Sen. John McCain passed away in late August , just days before the Republican primary in the race for Flake 's seat , and he had an outsize impact on the race .\nMcSally spoke movingly during her primary night victory speech about how he served as a mentor to her , both because of their military backgrounds and their love of Arizona .\n`` I am forever grateful to have had the chance to know him to learn from him and even to work with him , '' she said in her Aug. 28 speech .\nThat said , she did not receive an endorsement from the McCain family in the midterm race , even though she and Cindy McCain spoke at the same Election Eve event -- alongside Ducey and Kyl .\nIn spite of the fact that McCain held his seat for decades , it lies within the power of the governor and not McCain 's family to determine who will fill the spot until a special election can be held to formally fill it in 2020 .\nAt a news conference today , Ducey said that he was grateful that McSally and Cindy McCain `` were able to get together and visit earlier this week and clear the air . ''\nCindy McCain posted a tweet supporting the decision and calling on McSally to remember her husband 's legacy .\n`` My husband \u2019 s greatest legacy was placing service to AZ & USA ahead of his own self-interest .

He said that decision was made in an effort to `` respect the will of the voters . ''\nAssuming McSally 's appointment progresses , the special election for McCain 's seat will be held in 2020 , and then would be up for it 's regularly scheduled re-election in 2022 . Should McSally continue forward , and run for re-election , she will have campaigned three times in six years , losing once .\nAnd since McCain won his sixth term in 2016 and Sinema 's seat is up for re-election in 2024 , Arizonans will have gone through five Senate elections in a decade .", "I wo n't lie . After reading the CNN piece titled `` Senate Dems , powerless to stop Trump nominees , regret 'nuclear option ' power play , '' I experienced some deeply satisfying schadenfreude . Feel free to keep President Barack Obama , Sen. Harry Reid and those who implored Senate Democrats to blow up the filibuster a few years ago in your thoughts as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges . But be sure to remember how recklessness begets recklessness in Washington , D.C .\n`` I do regret that , '' Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware , a Democrat who voted to weaken the filibuster three years ago , tells CNN . `` I frankly think many of us will regret that in this Congress because it would have been a terrific speed bump , potential emergency brake , to have in our system to slow down nominees . ''\nIt always was a terrific speed bump , senator . One of the reasons we value tradition , norms and process is that we do n't know what the future holds . But , you 'll note , these Democrats do n't regret their vote for majoritarianism or power grabs . They regret that Trump ( and it would be the same for Mitt Romney or any moderate Republican , for that matter ) will now be able to operate under the rules they set for themselves .\nIt 's worth remembering that Democrats did n't used a parliamentary procedure to change the rules so that federal judicial nominees and executive-office appointments can move to confirmation votes with a simple majority for some grand ideological purpose . They did it for short-term political gains that no one will remember . Does any Democrat believe helping Obama name some left-wing populists to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( which did n't even exist until 2011 ) and the National Labor Relations Board was worth it ?\nSen. Jeff Merkley ( D-Ore. ) , another leading proponent of destroying checks and balances , charged at the time that without the nuclear option Republicans were `` going to disable '' the executive branch . `` It 's come into a realm where it 's just unacceptable because if the executive branch ca n't function , then the nation ca n't respond to the big challenges it faces , '' he explained . He seemed to be under the impression that presidents make laws\u2014or maybe just liberal presidents .\nThe liberal punditry hammered the filibuster back then the same way it 's hammering the Electoral College today . In 2010 , Paul Krugman wrote a column in The New York Times claiming that the filibuster would destroy America .\nI do not exaggerate . He wrote : `` We 've always known that America 's reign as the world 's greatest nation would eventually end . But most of us imagined that our downfall , when it came , would be something grand and tragic . What we 're getting instead is less a tragedy than a deadly farce . ''\nThe idea that Democrats had n't been able to function was a myth . Obama , supposedly powerless to face America 's `` big challenges , '' had already passed a nearly trillion-dollar stimulus , a restructuring of the entire health care system and a tangled overhaul of financial regulation . The president also appointed two wholly liberal Supreme Court justices with no meaningful opposition .\nThe American people then said , `` That 's enough . '' For Merkley , Krugman , Coons , Reid and others , that would n't do .\nWhen Reid 's party was in the minority , he warned that weakening the Senate filibuster would `` destroy the very checks and balances our Founding Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government . '' He was right . With his party 's attainment of a Senate majority , Reid 's reverence for the Founding Fathers rapidly faded , so much so that he used the nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster from some Senate debates .\nAs a practical matter , these changes will likely never be reversed . What kind of majority is going to restore the filibuster to its opponents ? What kind of majority would n't use the same process to roll back the previous Senate 's abuses ? ( And the latter makes complete sense . ) After all , the Chris Coons of the world will never be courageous enough to stand for process and stability over partisanship gain . In a Republican environment where winning itself is the ideology , it becomes even less likely .\nAlthough each party detests the filibuster when it is in power , progressives hold an enduring contempt for it because they hold an enduring contempt for federalism in general . Even today , some liberals are trying to figure out ways to work Senate procedure to put Chief Judge Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court . As if Republicans would n't then simply turn around and load the court themselves . This kind of arms race sets dangerous precedents . It 'd be nice if the nation realized it .", "Shortly after police arrived at Botham Jean \u2019 s apartment that night in 2018 and attempted to revive him , they were joined by the head of the Dallas police union . By then , Guyger had been escorted away from the scene and placed in a police vehicle . As captured on body cam video , Dallas Police Association President Michael Mata asked another officer to turn off the dash cam which could record his conversation with Guyger .\n\u201c Why am I thanking Mike Mata ? \u201d activist Changa Higgins said at a protest last week . \u201c Because , basically , during this case , he exposed what we \u2019 ve been saying about his ass all along . The DPA has too much power in policing in this city . \u201d\nProsecutors wanted to make the point that not only was Guyger being treated differently because she was a police officer , but that Mata had asked another officer to go outside of policy\u2014by requesting the camera be turned off\u2014in order to give her this special treatment . Across the country , Police union officials commonly get preferred access to officers who kill . They get to hear their stories before they make formal statements . They also get to help shape those stories .\nPolice unions exert pressure on policymakers , too , opposing and obstructing transparency efforts , and thereby maintaining control of what the public knows about police violence . When California enacted a law this year requiring police departments to share misconduct records , police slow-walked requests , and then still withheld documents .\nNow , the Long Beach police union has proposed new contract language stipulating officers be informed when records pertaining to them are requested , and to be given five days to review the records before they are released . The new policy would also require that the name and organization of the person who requested misconduct records be disclosed to that officer . Legal experts fear these kinds of proposals will proliferate throughout the state , discouraging people from seeking misconduct records .\nThis is a national problem . More than 100 newsrooms across the country spent over a year in 2018 and 2019 trying to collect police misconduct records in a nationwide project coordinated by USA TODAY . \u201c Dozens of police agencies ignored repeated requests made under states \u2019 open records laws , \u201d they found . \u201c Other agencies denied requests , saying sharing the information with the public violates officers \u2019 privacy rights or is not in the public \u2019 s best interest\u2026 In state after state , USA TODAY had to employ the assistance of its lawyers to gain access to the public records. \u201d In the end , these reporters found at least 200,000 instances of alleged misconduct , and more than 30,000 officers who had been decertified by state oversight agencies .\nWhen police unions act in order to protect a co-worker , that can put them at odds with protecting public safety and civil rights . It has also put them at odds with those in police leadership who want to better serve the public interest . In Phoenix , when a police chief pushed back on the city \u2019 s disciplinary review board for routinely overturning his recommendations to discipline officers , the police unions organized a no-confidence vote in him . After the chief held a news conference criticizing the union in 2014 , the city fired him . Internal attempts at accountability can end in punishment , perhaps more often than the misconduct itself\u2014although measuring that for certain would require access to the records police departments so often withhold .\nPolice killing cases that make it to trial , then , traverse an obstacle course which favors police : the union , the internal investigation , the secrecy . A prosecutor who routinely works with police to make criminal cases has to now make a case that compels a grand jury to indict a police officer\u2014in proceedings themselves which are unknown until their conclusion , if at all . If a grand jury recommends an indictment\u2014and \u201c if the prosecutor wants an indictment she or he is probably going to get one because they do have so much control over the grand jury , \u201d as law professor Andrew Leipold told The New York Times\u2014then the prosecutor can charge the officer , and then , finally , there \u2019 s the trial itself .\nWith the Guyger case , it ultimately depended on the jury in her criminal trial . In the end , they weren \u2019 t permitted to watch the video of Guyger and her union president trying to get her to talk without being recorded . Maybe it didn \u2019 t matter . It could already have been clear to them that Guyger got special treatment . The members of this jury might also have been more aware of the problem than others have been\u2014seven were black , five were non-black people of color , and four were white . In the end , they did something that should be routine : they returned a verdict holding a police officer to the same standard they might hold a civilian who shot and killed someone on sight .", "Raul A.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .\n( CNN ) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend , there was grim news from San Francisco . On Wednesday night , Kate Steinle , 31 , was fatally shot , apparently randomly , while walking with her father on a busy pier . A Mexican immigrant , who CNN reported was in the country without documentation , was arrested in her death .\nIllegally re-entering the country after being deported , as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done , is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific , violent crime . And according to immigration authorities , he has seven other felony convictions , including four for drug offenses .\nBut that does n't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States . Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border ( illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low ) . He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society .\nLopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us .\nIt is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime . Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population , including undocumented immigrants , grew from 1990 to 2010 .\nJUST WATCHED Undocumented immigrants want to enlist Replay More Videos ...

Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers ? Of course not .\nThe same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday 's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes .

Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times , and yet he was still here in the country without authorization .\nBack in 2011 , the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $ 12,500 to deport a person . Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman .\nAnother lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement ; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement . Up to now , immigration authorities have wasted time , manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as , say , gardeners and maids , while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks .\nThat 's why it was good news last week that the Department of Homeland Security announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals .\nThis move is a step in the right direction , because it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety .

Instead , despite the fact that our country spends more on immigration enforcement than all other law enforcement agencies combined , our system failed Kate Steinle .\nAlthough Steinle 's death was a tragedy , it was the alleged action of one man .

At least nine people were injured as the suspect shot randomly from the moment he appeared in front of the building in northwest Colorado Springs .\nPolice said Saturday that items Dear brought to the scene had been secured and were no longer a threat .

He tried to escape in his car when the gunman looked at him .\n\u201c He came out , and we looked each other in the eye , and he started aiming , and then he started shooting , \u201d Licano said . \u201c I saw two holes go right through my windshield as I was trying to quickly back up and he just kept shooting and I started bleeding . \u201d\nLicano sped off and took refuge at a nearby grocery store , according to the Associated Press .\n\u201c He was aiming for my head , \u201d he said of the gunman . \u201c It \u2019 s just weird to stare in the face of someone like that . And he didn \u2019 t win . \u201d\nThe gunman surrendered as officers were maneuvering a sniper in place to shoot him . Officers shouted at Dear who then agreed to surrender .\nDuring the lengthy standoff , police were able to reach numerous people trapped in the building , including some only yards away from the gunman , blocked only by office walls . Some had taken refuge in a `` safe room '' established in case of emergencies .\nThe Planned Parenthood clinic , which provides abortions and other women 's reproductive health services , has been the site of numerous protests by anti-abortion advocates over the years , but it was not known whether Friday 's shooting was ideologically motivated .\n`` We do n't yet know the full circumstances and motives behind this criminal action , and we do n't yet know if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack , '' Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains said in a statement . `` We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country . ''\nOne anti-abortion group of about 70 people holds prayer vigils on Thursdays and Fridays , but had left this week by 10 a.m. , about an hour and a half before the shooting spree began .\nJoseph Martone Jr. , a frequent protester at the clinic , told The Gazette that he was appalled by the shooting incident . Martone , who was out of state Friday , is an adamant protester at the center and has been arrested , jailed and paid fines for his trespassing , but said he prefers prayer over violence .\n`` It 's a really sad thing , no matter what the reason , '' he told the newspaper . `` No matter how much I despise Planned Parenthood , no one deserves to go through this , and I pray for everybody involved . ''\nIt was the second shooting incident in a month in the city of around 430,000 people . On Oct. 31 , a gunman shot and killed three people near downtown Colorado Springs before he died in a shootout with police .", "HOUSTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - George Floyd , a black man whose death under the knee of a white police officer roused worldwide protests against racial injustice , was memorialized at his funeral on Tuesday as \u201c an ordinary brother \u201d transformed by fate into the \u201c cornerstone of a movement . \u201d\nDuring a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd \u2019 s boyhood home of Houston , family members , clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation .\nThe funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd , 46 , handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes . The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out , \u201c Mama , \u201d and groans , \u201c Please , I can \u2019 t breathe , \u201d before falling silent and still .\nThe officer , Derek Chauvin , 44 , has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd \u2019 s May 25 death . All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident .\nFloyd \u2019 s dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets , undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic , demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement .\n\u201c I can breathe . And as long as I \u2019 m breathing , justice will be served , \u201d Floyd \u2019 s niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church . \u201c This is not just a murder but a hate crime . \u201d\nWilliams was one of several relatives and friends who addressed the service , remembering Floyd as a loving , larger-than-life personality . The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as \u201c Big Floyd . \u201d\nHis younger brother , Terrence Floyd , spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying .\nHis older brother , Philonise , sobbing in grief , told mourners , \u201c George was my personal superman . \u201d\nCivil rights activist the Rev . Al Sharpton called Floyd \u201c an ordinary brother \u201d who grew up in a housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become .\n\u201c God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world , \u201d Sharpton said , invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament .\nSharpton said the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 \u201c I Have a Dream \u201d speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. , who was assassinated in 1968 .\nSome 2,500 people attended the funeral , after more than 6,000 people filed past Floyd \u2019 s open casket on Monday .\nTwo columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service . A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland , Texas , where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden , the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election , addressed the funeral service via a video recording , lamenting that \u201c too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life . \u201d\n\u201c We must not turn away . We can not leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism , \u201d he said .\nA man raises his hand in solidarity as the coffin of George Floyd , whose death in Minneapolis police custody has sparked nationwide protests against racial inequality , is seen in a horse-drawn carriage as it enters the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in Pearland , Texas , U.S. , June 9 , 2020 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Adrees Latif\nTwo voter registration tables were set up outside the church .\nAmong those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians .\nThe mother of Eric Garner , the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014 , was present , as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging . Three white men were charged in his death .\nFallout from Floyd \u2019 s death , and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests , also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure .\nHundreds of protesters packed Seattle \u2019 s city hall late Tuesday night , chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force .\nDays after Seattle \u2019 s mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas , the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday , bringing severe criticism .\nA Republican , Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests , focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals .\nFor Special Report : How union , Supreme Court shield Minneapolis cops -\nFor Before the court : A united front takes aim at qualified immunity :", "On his 16th birthday on Thursday , a Saugus High School student took out a .45-caliber handgun from his backpack , authorities said , shot five boys and girls on campus , killing two of them , and then shot himself .\nThe shooting prompted a mass response from local and federal authorities as they searched for the teen , who they found within hours and was in grave condition at a hospital .\nAt 9:23 a.m. a 16-year-old girl was pronounced dead from her wounds .

Bill Nelson identified the gunman as Esteban Santiago and said the man was carrying a military ID card that authorities were still working to authenticate .\nRelatives of the gunman confirmed his identity and told reporters that the 26-year-old had recently been treated for mental health issues .\nAn aunt , Maria Luisa Ruiz , told NorthJersey.com that Mr. Santiago had appeared happy after recently becoming a father but that about a month ago he began experiencing a mental health crisis .\n\u201c Like a month ago , it was like he lost his mind , \u201d she said \u201c He said he saw things . \u201d\nShe said Mr. Santiago , who was born in Puerto Rico , had spent time in Iraq with the Army National Guard and was currently living in Anchorage , Alaska .\nThe suspected gunman \u2019 s brother , Bryan Santiago , told the Associated Press that his family had recently gotten a call from his brother \u2019 s girlfriend saying that he was getting psychological treatment in Alaska where the couple lived .\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel declined to comment on whether the gunman had just arrived to the airport on a flight , but Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca wrote in a post to Facebook that the gunman was a passenger on a flight that landed at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and had checked his gun in his baggage . After landing at the Florida airport , the gunman retrieved his luggage , went into a bathroom to load his firearm and subsequently began shooting people in the baggage claim area , Mr. LaMarca said .\nSheriff Israel dispelled rumors that there was a second shooting at the airport , saying the baggage claim in Terminal 2 where the gunman opened fire was the only site of gunfire .\n\u201c At this point , it looks like he acted alone , \u201d Sheriff Israel said , adding it was too early to speculate on the gunman \u2019 s motive for carrying out the shooting .\nHe said when deputies arrived on scene that the gunman was taken into custody \u201c without incident \u201d but declined to elaborate .\nNo flights were arriving or leaving the airport Friday afternoon and airport Director Mark Gale said it was unclear how long the airport the would remain closed .\nLaw enforcement officials said they first began receiving calls reporting gunfire in Terminal 2 of the airport at 12:55 p.m Friday .\nNews footage from the scene showed people evacuating from the airport and standing on the tarmac as first responders rushed to the scene . Throughout the afternoon , people could be seen streaming out of airport exits and at various points crouching behind emergency vehicles to take cover .\nFormer White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and that \u201c everyone is running. \u201d He later wrote that the scene seemed calm and that \u201c the police aren \u2019 t letting anyone out of the airport . \u201d\nFlorida Gov .

Everyone who took part is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s American Trends Panel ( ATP ) , an online survey panel that is recruited through national , random sampling of residential addresses . This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection . The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender , race , ethnicity , partisan affiliation , education and other categories . Read more about the ATP \u2019 s methodology . Here are the questions used for the report , along with responses , and its methodology .\nThe public \u2019 s views of the nation \u2019 s economy remain more positive than at any point in the past two decades . In addition , more Americans say President Trump \u2019 s policies have made the economy better ( 44 % ) than worse ( 29 % ) , while 26 % say they have not had much effect .\nThe public \u2019 s ratings of economic conditions turned much more favorable shortly after Trump took office in 2017 , as a result of a surge in positive views among Republicans . These attitudes have shown little change more recently .\nToday , 57 % of Americans rate the national economy as excellent ( 16 % ) or good ( 42 % ) . This is virtually unchanged from last September , when 56 % of the public held positive views of the economy . A third of the public views economic conditions as only fair ; just 9 % say the nation \u2019 s economy is in poor shape .\nThe national survey by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , conducted Jan. 6-19 among 12,638 adults , finds that views of the economy \u2013 and the impact of Trump \u2019 s policies \u2013 continue to be deeply divided along partisan lines .\nCurrently , 81 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is excellent or good . These views have changed only modestly over the past two years . But between November 2016 ( just before Trump \u2019 s victory in the presidential election ) and March 2017 the share of Republicans with a positive view of the economy approximately doubled , from 18 % to 37 % . And by November 2018 , they had doubled again , to 75 % .\nBy contrast , Democrats \u2019 assessments of economic conditions have changed only modestly since before Trump took office . Currently , 39 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say conditions are excellent or good . In November 2016 , 46 % had a positive impression of the economy .\nOverall , the public holds more positive than negative views about the impact of Trump \u2019 s economic policies . While 44 % say that the president \u2019 s economic policies have made economic conditions better , 29 % say they have made the economy worse ; 26 % say Trump \u2019 s policies have not had much of an effect .\nPublic views of how Trump \u2019 s policies have affected the economy are more positive than they were for Obama \u2019 s policies at the same point in his presidency , when overall assessments of the economy were much more negative than they are currently . In February 2012 , roughly equal shares said Obama \u2019 s economic policies had made things better ( 33 % ) and worse ( 35 % ) ; 25 % said they had not had much effect . At that time , only 11 % of the public rated the economy as excellent or good , with overwhelming majorities of both Democrats ( 84 % ) and Republicans ( 94 % ) rating the national economy negatively .\nHowever , optimism that conditions would improve was relatively high eight years ago . Today , public outlook for the economy a year from now is mixed : Currently , 29 % of Americans say conditions will be better , 26 % worse , while 45 % say they will be about the same as now . In February 2012 , 44 % expected economic conditions to improve ; just 10 % said they would get worse , while 42 % said they would be about the same as they were then .\nOpinions about the impact of presidents \u2019 policies and the future course of the economy also are highly partisan . In the current survey , an overwhelming share of Republicans ( 80 % ) say Trump \u2019 s policies have made economic conditions better . Democrats are divided : Nearly half ( 48 % ) say Trump \u2019 s policies have had a negative impact , 38 % say they have not had much of an effect and 14 % say they have helped the economy .\nViews about the state of the economy a year from now are somewhat less partisan , but while nearly half of Republicans ( 46 % ) expect economic conditions in the U.S. to be better a year from now than they are today , just 15 % of Democrats say the same .\nOverall , 57 % of Americans say current economic conditions are excellent or good , but these views vary across demographic groups : older people , those with higher incomes , men and whites are particularly likely to say the economy is in good shape , while these views are less widely shared among younger people , those with lower incomes , women , blacks and Hispanics .\nThese demographic gaps are little changed over the course of the last few years . Americans ages 65 and over are the most positive in their evaluations of the economy , with 70 % saying it is in excellent or good shape . By comparison , about half of 18-29 year olds ( 47 % ) say the same . And while more than six-in-ten white people ( 64 % ) offer positive evaluations of the economy , that compares with roughly half of Hispanic people ( 49 % ) and just a third of black Americans ( 33 % ) .\nThere is a 12 percentage-point gender gap in these views : 64 % of men say the economy is doing well , compared with 52 % of women . And while 64 % of college graduates say economic conditions are excellent or good , 54 % of those without a college degree say the same .\nViews of the economy also differ starkly by income . Among those with annual family incomes of $ 100,000 or more , 72 % have positive views of the economy , with one-quarter rating it as excellent . Roughly two-thirds of those who make $ 75,000- $ 99,999 ( 65 % ) and $ 50,000- $ 74,999 ( 64 % ) rate the economy as excellent or good .\nHowever , less than half of those who make less than $ 30,000 ( 44 % ) rate the economy positively , with just 10 % saying they rate the economy today as excellent .\nAmong Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , a large majority ( 81 % ) rate the economy as excellent or good . Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to view the economy positively : 88 % do so , including 41 % who say the economy is in excellent shape . Among moderate and liberal Republicans , 72 % offer positive ratings , with 18 % saying economic conditions are excellent .\nOverall , 39 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rate the economy as excellent or good , and there are only modest ideological differences in these views .\nWhile majorities of Republicans in all age groups offer positive ratings of the economy , older Republicans and Republican leaners are much more likely than younger Republicans to do so : 90 % of Republicans ages 65 and older rate the economy positively , while 68 % of those under 30 say the same .\nAmong Democrats and Democratic leaners there is only modest variation in these views by age , although Democrats 65 and older view the economy more positively than those under age 65 ( 47 % vs. 37 % ) .\nIn both parties , those with higher incomes and those with college degrees are more likely to say current economic conditions are excellent or good . And the partisan gap is similar across all educational and income levels . For instance , 89 % of Republicans with a college degree rate the economy as excellent or good , compared with 47 % of Democratic college graduates \u2013 a 42 point gap . Among those without a college degree , the gap is nearly identical ( 45 points ) .\nAcross income and partisan groups , high income Republicans are the most likely to see the economy as in excellent or good shape , while low income Democrats are least likely to say this . But partisanship is a bigger factor than income in these evaluations : In fact , Republicans with incomes of less than $ 30,000 ( 69 % ) offer significantly more positive ratings of the economy than Democrats with incomes of $ 100,000 or more ( 52 % ) .\nOpinions about the state of the nation \u2019 s economy are correlated with views of Trump \u2019 s job performance . People who have the most positive views of economic conditions \u2013 the 16 % of adults who say the economy is excellent \u2013 overwhelmingly approve of Trump . Nearly nine-in-ten ( 86 % ) approve of his performance , including 76 % who strongly approve .\nYet those who say economic conditions are good are not nearly as supportive of Trump . Half of this group approves of his job performance , with only about a third ( 36 % ) strongly approving .\nIn part , this reflects partisanship in views of both the economy and Trump . For instance , among Republicans who view the economy as good ( half of all Republicans and leaners ) , 82 % approve of Trump \u2019 s job performance . But among the roughly one third of Democrats who give the economy the same rating , only 11 % approve of Trump \u2019 s performance .\nAmong the 15 % of Republicans who rate conditions as only fair , a narrow majority ( 55 % ) approves of his job performance . Among Democrats who view the economy as only fair , just 4 % approve of the job Trump is doing .", "Social Security is running out of money . America gives too much aid to other countries . Nothing is made in the U.S.A. anymore .\nThose are some of the reasons why working class whites feel the economy is headed in the wrong direction . Some 53 % of these folks said they are very dissatisfied with the country 's economic situation , well above the share among whites with college degrees or working class blacks and Hispanics . Another 25 % said they are somewhat dissatisfied , according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey .\nWhat 's more , they think their children will suffer as a result . Half feel their kids ' standard of living will be worse when they hit the same age .\nThis gloomy view , however , does n't extend to their own financial circumstances .\nNearly two-thirds of working class whites say they are satisfied with their own personal financial situation . More than three-quarters are optimistic about how things are going in their own lives . A similar share of those who are working feel their jobs are secure .\nTake Pete McGuire of Mansfield Center , Connecticut . McGuire , who runs a landscaping company with his wife , was frustrated recently when he could n't find work boots made in the United States at Cabela 's , an outdoor recreation retailer .\n`` We 're not making anything , '' McGuire said , noting that the few American products he does find are often more expensive . `` I 'd be willing to pay a little more to buy something made in the U.S.A. to keep somebody working here . ''\nThe 61-year-old ticked off why he thinks the nation is in trouble : The national debt is growing . The federal government is doing more to help other countries than struggling Americans . Veterans are being ignored .\nRelated : Working class whites blame Washington , but still want more government help\nHis four daughters will have to deal with all of this . And most of them `` are making ends meet by the skin of their teeth . '' Two are stay-at-home moms and one is a teacher 's assistant in an elementary school . The one who is doing the best financially became an accountant after graduating from the University of Connecticut .\nAs for his own financial security ? `` We 're comfortable . We are paying our bills , '' said McGuire , who recently applied for disability because of back problems that have forced him to cut back at the landscaping firm .\nMcGuire feels he was able to build a more secure life because the economy was better during most of his working years . After he graduated high school , he was always employed -- in textile factories , for the state , in a construction company and finally at his own small business , often holding second jobs on the side pumping gas or mowing lawns . His wife , who has a bachelor 's degree , works for the city of Norwich , providing job coaching for mentally handicapped kids . He has a small pension and retiree health care , thanks to his tenure with the state Department of Transportation .\nNowadays , he feels , it 's harder for blue-collar workers to make a decent living .\n`` When was the last time a factory worker got a pay raise of more than a dime or a quarter ? '' he said .\nWorking class whites were less likely to get a boost in pay than their college educated peers . The poll found some 42 % of working age people in this group said they or someone in their household had received a raise in the last year , compared to 54 % of whites with college diplomas .\nIt 's not surprising that many working class whites have a negative view of the nation 's economic direction , said Gary Burtless , a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution . Americans are often more dour if their political party is not in power . And since many working class whites lean Republican , they feel the Obama administration has made things worse . ( Some 53 % of working class white Americans CNN/KFF surveyed said they were Republicans or leaned that way , while 33 % said they were Democrats or Democratic-leaners and 11 % independents . )\nRelated : The anatomy of a white working class Trump voter\nPlus , Republican nominee Donald Trump and his onetime rivals spent the past year decrying how troubled the nation is , he said .\n`` People are more likely to the take the party line about the state of the economy than their own private economic circumstances , '' Burtless said . `` If we had a President McCain or a President Romney , they 'd say the economy is n't so bad . ''\n`` Everything Obama and his administration does is wrong , '' said Gibson , 82 , who just retired as the owner of a real estate escrow business . `` I 'm not sure Obama knows what he 's doing and he does n't listen to people . ''\nThe president 's actions have n't directly hurt Gibson 's finances , however . He worked well beyond the typical retirement age because he liked it and now plans to live off savings and investments . His daughter and grown grandson are also employed and doing fine .\nBut among his circle of friends , there 's a lot of concern over the economy , national security and America 's standing in the world .\n`` It 's a feeling that everyone is on pins and needles , '' he said , noting that the economy is only growing at a 1 % rate and many people have dropped out of the labor market because they ca n't find jobs . `` You do n't know what 's going to happen . We 're a ship without a captain right now . ''\nOthers , like Nicole King , feel the nation 's problems have been building for a while and blames both parties for not coming together to address the issues .\nKing , who watches both CNN and Fox and listens to NPR to get a variety of views , said she is concerned about the shaky state of Social Security and the mounting national debt . She also fears the next generation is not as hard working , which will further damage the economy .\n`` All those things together do n't paint a very positive picture , '' said King , 40 , who feels her job in a bank 's IT department is secure . `` The U.S. as a brand is not as strong as it once was . ''\nThe Charlotte , N.C. , resident and her husband are on a very strict budget so they can save money for retirement and their children 's college education . They buy used cars and gave their older daughter , who is 3 , a piggy bank so she will learn the value of money at an early age . And they worry that their daughters will not be as comfortable as they are because the economy is so troubled .\nPart of working class whites ' frustration with the nation 's direction stems from their feeling marginalized in society , said Arlie Hochschild , a professor emerita in sociology at the University of California , Berkeley , and author of the new book , Strangers In Their Own Land : Anger and Mourning on the American Right .\nThey think the nation views them as uneducated and racist , Hochschild said . Their pro-life views are demonized , while they feel under attack from the rise of secularism . And the tipping point is that their path upwards on the economic ladder is blocked by the decline of the middle class .\nYet , at the same time , they draw happiness from living in their own isolated enclaves with family , neighbors and fellow churchgoers nearby .\n`` People are more optimistic personally than they are about the country as a whole , '' Hochschild said .\nWhite , Working Class & Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white , working class Americans and voters who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump .

But not by much .\nThe U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs last month , according to the government . That 's an improvement from December , but was far weaker than hoped . Economists had been expecting an addition of 178,000 jobs .\nThey called the report `` disappointing '' and `` weak , '' but characterized broader economic growth as `` steady-as-she-goes . ''\n`` The U.S. economy is very stable , '' said Julia Coronado , chief economist , North America for BNP Paribas . `` 2014 might not be a breakout year , but it 's not a disaster either . ''\nMany economists had also been hoping that December 's weak job gains would be revised much higher , as many experts were quick to write off the December report as a fluke . The number was revised higher , but only by 1,000 jobs to 75,000 .\nLowest unemployment in 5 years , but : The unemployment rate was 6.6 % in January , as 10 million Americans were counted as unemployed . Overall , the unemployment rate has improved substantially since it peaked at 10 % in 2009 and is now at its lowest level in more than five years .\nThat said , much of the decline in unemployment has come for a discouraging reason : some Americans are dropping out of the labor force . As of January , only 63 % of Americans over age 16 participated in the labor market -- meaning they either had a job or looked for one . Although there was a slight improvement in January , participation is still hovering around its lowest level since 1978 .\nWhile some of the decline is partly due to baby boomers retiring , economists are also concerned about the long-term unemployed , who may be giving up on the job market altogether . Following the report , one of President Obama 's top economic advisers , Jason Furman called the unemployment rate still `` unacceptably high . ''\nAbout 3.6 million Americans have been unemployed for six months or more . Those who were relying on extended government benefits lost that lifeline in December .\n`` These figures provide a stark reminder that despite the progress that has been made , the after-effects of the recession still linger and are creating hardship for many families , '' Furman wrote in a White House blog post .\nThe Federal Reserve has been stressing that its stimulus policies depend on the economic data , and while it has been aiming for an unemployment rate of 6.5 % , it 's expected to distance itself from using that number as its main measure of the job market .\n`` Using the narrow , widely reported unemployment rate alone could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of affairs , '' Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a prepared speech Thursday , ahead of the jobs report .\nRecently appointed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees next week .\nWhere are the jobs ? Surprisingly , more than half of January 's job gains came from traditional blue collar sectors . Goods-producing industries added more jobs than the services sector for the first time since 2005 .\nConstruction firms added 48,000 jobs and manufacturers added 21,000 jobs . The mining industry added 7,200 jobs .\nBut that was one of few bright spots in the report . The health care sector cut 400 jobs -- the first month of job losses since 2003 . Health care had been an industry with strong job growth throughout the recession .\nProfessional and business services added 36,000 jobs , but a large part of those jobs were through staffing agencies . About 15,000 jobs were added at restaurants and bars . Sporting goods , hobby , book and music stores cut 22,000 jobs .\nOverall , the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis . As of January , 7.8 million jobs have come back , but once economists also account for population growth , they expect that it will still take years to get back to a pre-recession job market .", "The unemployment rate is now a misleading number . Yes , the rate has fallen dramatically from its peak . But much of that decline has been the result of the fall in the labor force participation rate . It has fallen from a peak of over 67 percent in 2000 to 62.8 percent in August . So there is a long-term trend downwards , which accelerated in the Great Recession .\nIf the unemployment rate falls because discouraged workers are leaving the labor force , that is nothing to cheer . And it is certainly no basis for a Fed rate hike .\nWhy the bullish sentiments of some Fed officials for a rate hike ? I increasingly believe that there are unstated reasons buttressing their hawkish stance . They are likely concerns over financial stability issues . These officials certainly understand that a long period of low interest rates must result in financial bubbles . Capital has been mispriced and , hence , misallocated .\nAdditionally , margins have been squeezed for banks and other lenders . Finally , money market mutual funds have no sustainable business model at very low rates . These funds must pay to attract money , but can earn very little on their investments .\nNegative interest rates would make these problems even worse , which surely explains the aversion of Fed officials to negative rates . The Fed has learned from the experience of countries that have taken rates into negative territory .\nIf Fed officials see a need to raise interest rates for financial stability reasons , they should make that case . Anemic economic growth and weak job growth just do not sustain the case for higher rates . For these and other reasons , I see no rate hike in September .\nNotwithstanding the weak case for a September rate hike , Yellen has put the credibility of the FOMC on the line with her talk of a rate hike . I can still see the Fed hiking rates at the December meeting as it did in 2015 . I can not foresee two hikes in 2016 . If there is an increase in rates in December , the Fed will pause again .", "President Obama touted a provision in his Affordable Care Act on Thursday that would require health insurance providers to return money to consumers , pushing back on Republican criticism a day after the GOP-led House voted to delay key parts of the law .\nThe president \u2019 s signature health care overhaul -- commonly referred to as ObamaCare -- has come under fire by many Republicans who have worked to defeat , delay or gut major parts of it .\nAt the White House event Thursday , Obama highlighted more of the financial benefits tied to it -- specifically , a half billion dollars in rebates going to 9 million people under a provision of the law .\nInsurers must spend at least 80 cents of every dollar on medical care or quality improvement , or refund the difference . That 's the $ 500 million consumers are getting in rebates averaging about $ 100 . For Americans who get insurance through their work , the rebates go to their employers to be refunded or used to lower premiums .\n`` If they 're not spending your premium dollars on health care , they have to give you some money back , '' Obama said , appearing with a group of health care consumers in the East Room .\nThe president \u2019 s comments come a day after House lawmakers voted to delay two key components of ObamaCare , in an effort to chip away at the plan after the administration acknowledged new issues with its implementation .\nObama also noted that some states , ahead of the law 's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance , are anticipating lower premiums because of health insurance marketplaces that are being set up under the law so consumers can comparison shop for the coverage .\nObama pushed his pitch a day after the Republican-controlled House voted for the 38th time to eliminate , cut funding or scale back the 3-year-old law since the GOP took control of the House in January 2011 .\nRepublican leaders swiftly organized the votes after the administration , in early July , said it would delay until 2015 a requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers provide insurance coverage or pay a penalty .\nThe House voted 264-161 for a measure that would do exactly that . But they also voted 251-174 for a measure that would delay the individual mandate -- the requirement on individuals to buy health insurance -- for a year as well .\nRepublicans argue that both delays are necessary . While they endorsed the delay for businesses , House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP lawmakers say it 's unfair to deny everyone else a similar reprieve .\n`` It is not fair that the president is choosing to protect big business from ObamaCare , but not hardworking American taxpayers , '' Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , said on the House floor ahead of the vote .\nShe also said the delay was an admission that `` this is a train wreck , and it is not ready for prime-time . ''\nBut Democrats sharply disagreed , and accused Republicans of wasting time with yet another set of votes against the health care law . Rep. Joseph Crowley , D-N.Y. , said Republicans were n't simply trying to delay the requirements . `` It is their intention to destroy the Affordable Care Act ... to do away with it , to annihilate it entirely , '' Crowley said .\nThe votes marked the 38th time the GOP majority has tried to eliminate , defund or scale back the program since Republicans took control of the House in January 2011 . It is unlikely the Democrat-controlled Senate will advance the latest bills .", "A top tech official for the ObamaCare exchanges said just days before the launch of the troubled health law website that people inside the White House were nervous the site would be unavailable after its launch and would be a big embarrassment , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has learned .\nA Sept. 25 email chain from HealthCare.gov project manager Henry Chao , obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , suggests Obama administration officials had more fears than they let on publicly that the website would have problems before its Oct. 1 launch .\nIn the email to a number of apparent colleagues , Chao suggests the administration should design a more palatable way to tell the public that the website was not working in case it failed after the launch , saying that such a move could help prevent the media from \u201c just ramping up the hyperbole about hc.gov not [ being ] functional . \u201d\nThe email refers to a meeting the previous day , Sept. 24 , that included White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and CMS chief Marilyn Tavenner .\n\u201c When Todd Park and Marilyn was ( sic ) here yesterday one of the things Todd conveyed was this fear the WH has about hc.gov being unavailable , \u201d wrote Chao .\nHe added of Park : \u201c He will come back again and ask on 9/30 because after knowing him for the past 3+ years I can tell when he will hang on to something for a long time .

The official said that is \u201c a good indication that there 's high demand for the product . \u201d\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly blamed the website \u2019 s problems on unexpectedly high traffic .\nIn the email , Chao suggested the team should come up with a more palatable way to explain problems with the website so that the media did not pounce .\n\u201c Can you think about a better way to convey to the public when the site is not available ? \u201d wrote Chao . \u201c I am picturing in my mind all the major print and online publications taking screenshots of what is below and just ramping up the hyperbole about hc.gov not [ being ] functional . \u201d\nPresident Obama told reporters at a Nov. 14 news conference he was never told directly of the problems with the website before its launch .\n\u201c I was not informed directly that the website would not be working as -- the way it was supposed to , \u201d he said .", "WASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday he was willing to bring healthcare legislation up for a vote but was waiting for the go-ahead from President Donald Trump , who sent mixed signals last week about a bipartisan bill that would shore up insurance markets .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell waits to speak to reporters following a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington , U.S. October 17 , 2017 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Eric Thayer\nThe Republican president said on Oct. 12 that his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households under the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare . Last week , he praised and then dismissed a bipartisan bill to reinstate the subsidies for two years , until a broader replacement to Obamacare can be negotiated .\nThat legislation , introduced by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray , has drawn support from several Republican senators .\nAsked if he would put it up for a vote this week , McConnell , the Senate majority leader , punted to Trump .\n\u201c What I \u2019 m waiting for is to hear from President Trump what kind of healthcare bill he might sign , \u201d McConnell said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\n\u201c If there \u2019 s a need for some kind of interim step here to stabilize the market , we need a bill the president will actually sign , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m not certain yet what the president is looking for here , but I \u2019 ll be happy to bring a bill to the floor if I know President Trump would sign it . \u201d\nMcConnell said he believed Trump had not made up his mind about short-term legislation that would fall short of his promise for a full repeal and replacement of Obamacare .\nTrump promised during his presidential campaign to get rid of Obamacare , the signature healthcare law of his predecessor , Democrat Barack Obama . However , his fellow Republicans , who control Congress , have failed to do so because of deep party divisions .\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan , the top Republican in Congress , opposes the Alexander-Murray bill . With Trump waffling , its chances appeared to dim .\nDemocrats , meanwhile , pushed McConnell to bring the bill to the floor , saying the legislation would prevent insurance premiums from rising sharply .\n\u201c The president holds the key to preventing premiums from going up . Now that Leader McConnell has made it clear he will put the Murray-Alexander bill on the floor as soon as the president supports it , the president should say that he does , \u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement .\nSchumer told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d all 48 Democrats in the Senate back the bill .", "Washington ( CNN ) - President Obama continues to alter his signature promise in selling the Affordable Care Act back in 2009 and 2010 .\n`` If you like your plan , you can keep your plan , '' he said back then .\nBut that simple pledge has had to change as the Affordable Care Act has been implemented and a small percentage of Americans , albeit millions of people , have received cancellation notices from their insurance companies . And for the second time in two weeks , he 's tweaked the line .\nWhen President Obama spoke Monday night to a group of supporters , he said : `` While virtually every insurer is offering new , better plans and competing for these folks ' business , I realize that can be scary for people if you just get some notice like that . ''\n`` If you had or have one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan , what we said was , you could keep it if has n't changed since the law 's passed , '' added Obama .\n`` You 're grandfathered in , '' although he again noted insurance companies had the power to change it themselves .\nCNN White House Senior Correspondent Jim Acosta asked White House Spokesman Jay Carney on Tuesday if the president could go back , would he `` use the same words again '' and promise Americans they could keep their plans ?\n`` Well , the president , as awesomely powerful as the office is , ca n't go back in time , '' Carney said . `` And what the president is focused on is what we are all focused on which is getting this right for the American people . ''\n`` It is on us , '' Carney later added . `` Let me be clear , I 'm not \u2013 I am embracing the responsibility that the administration and that everyone involved in the market place has , to make sure that those individuals are getting the information that they need . ''\nThe President made his comments Monday in an address to Organizing for Action , the pro-Obama group formed from the President 's 2012 re-election campaign .\nEven though some people are getting kicked off existing plans , Obama has argued they 're probably going to get a better deal .\n`` Now , insurers are offering these new options , and they do n't just want to keep their current policyholders ; they want to cover the uninsured , too , '' he told supporters .\n`` And because of the competition between insurers , and the new health care tax credits , most people will be able to buy better plans for the same price or even cheaper than what they 've gotten before . Now , some Americans with higher incomes will pay more on the front end for better insurance with better benefits and better protections that could eventually help them a lot , even if right now they 'd rather be paying less . ''\nHe made similar points at a health care event in Boston last Wednesday .\nThe new line is a far cry from the shorter , bumper sticker ready pledge he made as he sought to calm nerves that health insurance reform would not ruin plans that Americans liked and were comfortable with even though many of those plans did n't cover things like prescription drugs , hospital stays or maternity care .\nIt was n't a one off back in 2009 and 2010 and even later during his 2012 re-election campaign . New York Magazine put together a montage of the very many iterations of it .\nBut it turns out the president did n't have the power to make that pledge . As insurance companies upgrade plans to comply with new Obamacare coverage rules , they are dropping plans for potentially millions of Americans who buy their insurance on the individual health insurance market .\nInsurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons ; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money , others seem to be .\nBack in 2009 , as a White House correspondent for ABC , CNN 's Jake Tapper challenged the president on his promise . And even back then , there appeared to be an asterisk .\n`` Well , no , no , I mean \u2013 when I say if you have your plan and you like it and your doctor has a plan , or you have a doctor and you like your doctor that you do n't have to change plans , what I 'm saying is the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform , '' Obama replied .\nAh ... the government is not going to make you change plans . Though the government might impose a situation that would cause a change of plans . So the promise was never quite as presented . And yet the president kept presenting it that way .\nBut that caveat did n't make it into the subsequent campaign speeches that featured the line .\nThe cancellations will not affect most Americans , but they could hurt public support for the law . Just 17 % of Americans said they 'll be better off under the law , but 41 % said it wo n't have much of an effect on them , according to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted in late September , just before the HealthCare.gov website went live . At that time four in ten said they would be worse off under the law .\nThose numbers are similar to a Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago , in which 36 % of Americans said they did n't think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family 's health care situation . Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse , and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better .\nRollout of the exchange websites that are supposed to allow Americans without insurance to shop from a selection of plans side-by-side has been troubled , to say the least . The website has been plagued by glitches , crashes , and is currently the subject of a Congressional investigation .\nFrustration with the law and the changes it causes in the health insurance landscape could be temporary growing pains as Americans get used to the reforms . But the frustration is likely to outlast problems with the website as Americans focus more on the cost of plans offered under Obamacare and on the choices available .\nCNN reported Monday on notes from an Obama administration `` war room '' meeting where officials expressed concern that once Americans had access to more information about the plans available , they might experience sticker shock .\nAn architect of the Affordable Care Act , MIT professor Jonathan Gruber , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer recently that most Americans will benefit from the law as it stabilizes the insurance market , fosters competition and guarantees coverage for almost all Americans .\nMost Americans get insurance from either the government or their employer and wo n't be affected much by the law , he said .\n`` About 5 to 6 percent get it on their and some of them will pay more , the young and health and not poor will pay more to get their health insurance . It 's a lot of people , but its small relative to the people who are going to gain and very small relative to the people who are n't affected , '' added Gruber .\nBut he also ceded that there will be winners and losers as the law is implemented . Some people will pay more and be forced to change their insurance . That 's a small percentage of the country , but a large number of people .\n`` Very very few people have to pay more and not get better insurance . That 's a very small fraction , '' said Gruber . `` Most of the people who will have to pay more will get better insurance than what they had before . ''", "Many people think of the right 's Obamacare hatred as an outgrowth of straightforward partisan and ideological truths . Movement conservatives broadly oppose the idea of taxing wealthy people to subsidize the lower and middle classes . They do n't like regulating the private sector very much either . Add in the political incentives they faced to uniformly oppose President Obama 's agenda , the zero Republican votes for the Affordable Care Act , and you 've planted seeds of lasting hostility .\nBut the hostility has become so deeply rooted that it now stands on its own , detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to it .\nIt has forced conservatives to blind themselves to the law 's positive , unobjectionable qualities , and police those within their ranks who dare to acknowledge them .\nTalking Points Memo 's Josh Marshall called this reactionary phenomenon Obamacare McCarthyism . It ensnared Rep. Jack Kingston , R-Ga. , who 's running for Senate in 2014 and had the temerity to suggest that Republicans should n't just idly mock the law when it stumbles . A few years ago , Sen. Mike Enzi , R-Wy0. , said he liked the concept of insurance exchanges -- which are crucial components of GOP-backed Medicare privatization proposals and other conservative reform ideas -- and now a hardline super PAC is using his words against him , as if he 'd called for the creation of a public option .\nBut on the battlefields of partisan warfare , this sort of post-principled contempt , combined with the inception of benefits , has turned the fight over Obamacare from a dispute over first principles , into a culture war , in which signaling matters more than tactical victories .\nThe repeal campaign -- once marked by earnest and sustained efforts to wipe the law off the books -- has all but burned itself out . But the law remains a potent political organizing force -- a rallying cry Republicans believe they can use to channel the right 's Obamacare obsession into voter turnout .\nAn astute friend remarked to me on Tuesday that the GOP 's position on Obamacare is coming to resemble its position on abortion in one key way : loudly , consistently , uniformly opposed , but ultimately not really driven to eliminate it . The backlash they 'd face would be brutal , but they might stand to gain by fighting it on the margins and keeping the issue alive .\nThe comparison holds at a state level too . The most effective Obamacare saboteurs have been GOP governors and legislatures who resisted the opportunity to create their own exchanges and have refused to expand Medicaid with federal dollars , as the law allows .\nMore generally , conservatives are wielding Obamacare the way they wielded culture war issues in the 1990s . The particulars are enormously different , but the political objectives are similar : pick an issue that both unites conservative voters and appeals to the discontent of moderates and use it first and foremost to fracture the Democratic coalition .\nI do n't think they 're going to fracture the Democratic coalition . But I can imagine the issue remaining an effective mobilizing tool for an otherwise agenda-less party through the end of Obama 's presidency .\nOf course , the culture wars of the '90s did n't all unfold the same way . Abortion and gun rights have proven to be more durable polarizing tools than immigration and gay rights .\nMy suspicion is that over time , as Affordable Care Act beneficiaries become friends , neighbors and family members of the law 's most ardent foes , hostilities will wane . The word `` Obamacare '' will have much less unifying power on the right when the law has 30 million beneficiaries than it does with 1 million ; and liberals will protect it from broader attacks on social insurance programs with relish , just as they use conservative Medicare and Social Security privatization proposals to their political benefit .\nBut the bitterness wo n't just disappear . We 're a long way from Southern governors clamoring for the Medicaid expansion , or building their own exchanges , let alone directing their own constituents to enroll on Healthcare.gov . And that 's a huge bummer for uninsured people in those states who hoped Obamacare would work as well for them as it 's likely to work in the rest of the country .", "The US has announced a countrywide ban on some e-cigarette flavours amid concerns about vaping among teens .\nThe ban applies to mint and fruit flavours that are offered in cartridge-based e-cigarettes , like the popular pods sold by Juul .\nThe US will continue to allow menthol and tobacco flavours , as well as fruit flavours delivered in other ways .\nThe action has been under consideration for more than a year , with several states passing similar rules .\nSouth Korea , India , Brazil are among the dozens of countries that have announced sweeping vaping bans .

At the same time , it 's a big industry . We want to protect the industry , '' Mr Trump said this week .\nJuul , the biggest e-cigarette company in the US , had already pulled its flavoured pods from the market , but Thursday 's action forces competitors to make a similar move , within 30 days .\nAdvocates for stricter rules have said that teens will switch to menthol if other options are eliminated .\nBut officials said they would take steps against menthol and tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes if the Food and Drug Administration sees that their use among teens is rising .\nThe US also recently raised the age for purchasing tobacco products to 21 . E-cigarettes are also governed by those rules .", "In the nine square miles that cover the 73111 ZIP Code in northeast Oklahoma City , there isn \u2019 t a single grocery store .

The Obama administration announced its Healthy Food Financing Initiative in 2010 to help deliver healthy food to communities with inadequate access . But as local governments have taken on the issue in recent years , they have redrawn the battle lines to include dollar stores .\nDollar stores are one of the few bricks-and-mortar stores expanding at a time when online sales have prompted other retailers to close or contract , fueled by low- and middle-income shoppers searching out value and convenience .\nDollar Tree Inc. , which bought Family Dollar in 2015 , and Dollar General Corp. dominate this landscape . The retailers went from operating just over 20,000 stores in 2010 to around 30,000 by the end of the decade .\nDollar General isn \u2019 t and never intended to be a grocery store , but every store offers its customers essentials such as eggs , milk and bread , said spokeswoman Crystal Ghassemi .\n\u201c We \u2019 re proud to serve these communities and to provide them an option , \u201d Ms. Ghassemi said . By January 2020 , 650 Dollar General locations will sell produce , she added , which is about 4.1 % of the company \u2019 s 16,000 stores .\nThe company said restrictive zoning ordinances and moratoria weren \u2019 t the solution to the issues , and those measures would only adversely affect their customers .\nDollar Tree and Family Dollar offer a \u201c broad range of basic essentials to families at low prices they can afford , \u201d said a spokesman , and don \u2019 t intend to be grocery stores .\n\u201c Dollar stores help alleviate the effects of \u2018 food deserts \u2019 in urban communities by helping serve the underserved , \u201d the spokesman said .

That ordinance required a special-use permit to build a small-box variety store within 10,000 feet of another . Three years later , Tulsa , Okla. , passed a similar zoning law .\n\u201c It seemed like every time dirt was turning in my district , it ended up being another dollar store , \u201d said Tulsa City Councilor Vanessa Hall-Harper , who championed the effort for more than a year . \u201c I have never said we don \u2019 t want any of these dollar stores .

And while some items are in short supply , the prospect of an overall shortage of food is far-fetched , say industry experts . Sure , shoppers may have to substitute brands and food items . But there is still plenty of food to go around , and logistical bottlenecks are easing .\nAs restaurants shut their doors to help slow the spread of COVID-19 , Americans have been shopping more for groceries and eating at home . Everyone has seen the empty supermarket shelves , particularly during the first week of state-ordered lockdowns . Those scenes , coupled with recent reports of dumped crops and milk , have jolted shoppers who fret about food supplies going forward .\nMountains of rotting squash in Florida . Midwest dairy farmers pouring milk down the drain . A South Dakota pork processing plant ordered to shut down after 400 employees tested positive for coronavirus .\nThen there are the empty supermarket shelves where the flour and yeast \u00ad\u2013 and toilet paper \u2013 used to be . It \u2019 s enough to make a shopper worry if there \u2019 s enough food to go around .\n\u201c I think the entire American public is getting a lesson in the supply chain , \u201d says Mike Troy , editorial director of Progressive Grocer . \u201c I bet they wish they weren \u2019 t . \u201d\nThey might especially wish they weren \u2019 t if they knew , say food supply experts , that the lessons they \u2019 re getting are likely wrong .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re overreacting , \u201d says Chris Mejia-Argueta , director of the Food and Retail Operations Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , referring to reports of disruptions to the food industry . \u201c I am very certain we \u2019 re not going to run out of food . \u201d\nStill , he understands why people may feel anxious if they don \u2019 t grasp exactly how the food supply chain is adapting to meet the crisis and simply see headlines about rotting vegetables and shuttered slaughterhouses . \u201c It \u2019 s human nature to worry about things that are a mystery to us , \u201d he says . The \u201c black box \u201d aspect of the food system \u201c creates uncertainty . And uncertainty leads to hoarding and fear . \u201d\nThose feelings were on display last week in a Massachusetts supermarket where a woman wearing a face mask rooted at the back of near-empty shelves of dried beans . She rolled her cart down the aisle , then scooped up a couple dozen cans of black beans , pintos , kidneys .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Food supply chain expert Chris Mejia Argueta , director of the Food and Retail Operations Lab at MIT , poses by his home , on April 7 , 2020 , in Cambridge , Massachusetts . He says better understanding of the supply chain can help prevent hoarding .\n\u201c Emergency beans , \u201d she told an onlooker . \u201c Can \u2019 t have enough . ... Or maybe this is too much ? \u201d She moved as though to put some back , but then thought better of it , and shrugged . \u201c Nah . Could be last chance . \u201d\nTo reduce such uncertainty , says Mr. Mejia-Argueta , \u201c we have to remember that the episodes we \u2019 re hearing about are local , and expected . \u201d\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration insists there are no nationwide shortages of food , though inventories may run low in grocery stores before restocking . \u201c Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the U.S. and there are currently no widespread disruptions reported in the supply chain , \u201d it reported last month .\nNone of which means that grocery shopping will feel normal any time soon . Hoarding should fade as at-home stockpiles have been built . But shoppers may still need to substitute , says Mr. Mejia-Argueta . When a favorite Italian pasta is absent , a store brand will have to do . Instead of Cheerios , we \u2019 ll eat oatmeal . Substitution helps the supply chain by spreading demand more evenly across a store \u2019 s stock .\nGrocery retailers and the supply chain as a whole are busy adapting , too . They are figuring out how shoppers respond to variable supplies of items and how much they need to stock and to put on display . And , by knowing in advance what \u2019 s available from their suppliers , they can use promotions to nudge shoppers to choose some products over others , \u201c without us even knowing it , \u201d says Mr. Mejia-Argueta .\nBefore the pandemic , 54 % of U.S. food dollars were spent on meals away from home . Now suppliers are scrambling to redirect food from restaurants and food service to retailers for at-home eating , a sudden and unprecedented shift in consumption .\nTake bacon , for example . Doug Baker , an executive at FMI , the food industry association , points out that \u201c the 20 pounds of bacon intended for food service may be repackaged under a store brand in 1 pound consumer packages. \u201d But that doesn \u2019 t happen overnight .\nLikewise , logistics resources are being diverted into food transport . \u201c One of the hardest parts now is how to move cargo from its source to where people need it , \u201d says Mr. Mejia-Argueta . \u201c More truckers are needed , so truckers are being diverted into the food supply system from other sectors that are momentarily quiet. \u201d Trucks that used to carry auto parts might now be hauling flour .\nAs a supply-chain scientist , Mr. Mejia-Argueta has looked at what could happen to severely disrupt food production and distribution . The main risks would come from panic purchasing and hoarding , workforce shortages due to illness , and a disaster-case economic crisis .\nEvidence of every one of those worst-case scenarios is already present , but not to any extent deemed threatening .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

In the latest episode , \u201c Do Right and Feed Everyone , \u201d Perdue chatted with veteran farm broadcaster Max Armstrong . \u201c I \u2019 m bullish on agriculture\u2014with the diversity , with the opportunity of e-commerce and direct sales , \u201d Perdue gushed . \u201c People are still fascinated with the way food is produced ! \u201d\nArmstrong mostly played along with Perdue \u2019 s schtick , but at the end of the interview , he pushed back : \u201c What do you say to that younger operator who entered this industry maybe five , six , seven years ago , and doggone it , things have gotten a lot tougher ? \u201d Armstrong asked , adding : \u201c This is long , dark tunnel for them . \u201d\nThe question wasn \u2019 t frivolous . Away from Perdue \u2019 s recording studio , the farm economy is circling the drain . The trade war initiated by Perdue \u2019 s boss , President Donald Trump , shows no sign of abating . Prices for corn and soybeans\u2014by far the two biggest US crops\u2014hover near or below farmers \u2019 production costs . Cotton farmers and winemakers are also being slammed by the trade war , and dairy farmers are in the grip of a long and brutal slump . Then there \u2019 s climate chaos : Record rains in the spring delayed planting through much of the Midwest , and early blizzards slammed the fall harvest . ( Here \u2019 s a report from the ground I did for Bite podcast . )\nThe Trump administration has responded to its trade mess by essentially parachuting cash into farm country , handing out $ 12 billion to farmers hurt by the trade war in 2018 and another $ 16 billion this year . In 2019 , trade aid and other government programs will account for nearly 40 percent of farmer profits , according to the American Farm Bureau Federation . As trade talks flounder , \u201c a third round of payments for farmers increasingly is seen as inevitable , particularly if a trade deal with China is not reached soon , \u201d the Washington Post reported Tuesday , citing anonymous sources within the agriculture department .\nDespite the influx of government cash , conditions are so bad that the farm economy is tanking anyway . Farm bankruptcies spiked 24 percent in September , compared to the same month a year before . With debt loads rising and commodity prices stuck in the mud , conventional agriculture banks are \u201c placing stricter terms on farm loans and doling out less money , \u201d the Wall Street Journal reported Monday . As a result , farmers are increasingly turning to \u201c more lightly regulated entities \u201d for financing to buy the season \u2019 s seeds and chemicals . These new-wave banks offer loans with \u201c interest rates double those of traditional farm banks , \u201d the Journal added\u2014putting farmers at risk of catastrophic losses if the season goes badly .\nWhile data on farmer suicides are scant , there \u2019 s evidence of an uptick amid all the debt and bankruptcies . In a wrenching article published this week , the Washington Post \u2019 s Annie Gowen reported that \u201c leaders and social workers in rural America say that , anecdotally , they \u2019 re seeing more \u201d suicides , and calls to crisis hotlines are rising . Gowen goes on to tell the story of South Dakota \u2019 s Chris Dykshorn , who , as financial troubles mounted on the corn , soybean , and cattle farm he took over from his father , killed himself this summer at the age of 35 .\n\u201c What we see happening is what farmers have done over the years\u2014many of them have to have off-farm jobs in order to survive during this period of time , \u201d Perdue advised . In other words : get a job . In early October , Perdue delivered a similar lecture to struggling dairy farmers at an industry expo : \u201c In America , the big get bigger and the small go out\u2026I don \u2019 t think in America we , for any small business , we have a guaranteed income or guaranteed profitability . \u201d\nCommodity farmers supported Trump overwhelmingly in 2016 , and they \u2019 ve stuck with him , according to a recent poll .

One day he \u2019 s on the verge of an agreement with China on trade ; the next he \u2019 s tweeting about holding off until after the election .\nOn one thing , however , Trump and his administration have been clear , consistent , coordinated and relentless : waging a war on the poor . Not a war on poverty but a war on the most vulnerable themselves .\nColumnists In-depth political coverage , sports analysis , entertainment reviews and cultural commentary .\nDespite low unemployment , millions of Americans \u2014 the Brookings Institution estimates an astounding 44 % of all workers in the prime working ages of 18-64 \u2014 struggle to get by on median wages of little over $ 10 an hour or $ 18,000 a year . The working poor face soaring costs of housing , health care , transportation , utilities and , of course , debt \u2014 all rising faster than their wages .\nThe official \u201c poverty rate \u201d is far lower than any accounting of the true needs of a family . The National Center for Children in Poverty estimates that the average family needs about twice as much income as the poverty level to meet basic needs .\nCruelly , the Trump response to this is to make it worse . The administration and Republicans in Congress oppose raising the minimum wage and won \u2019 t even allow a vote on it in the Senate . Now the administration proposes lowering the poverty line over time by pegging the inflation adjustments lower than the actual increase in costs . All programs that help low-wage workers would be affected . The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects that 250,000 seniors would get less help in purchasing prescription drugs , 300,000 children would lose health care under the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) . This rule combined with others that the administration has imposed will cost literally millions of low-wage workers to face cutbacks in food assistance .\nStudent loan debt is now $ 1.5 trillion , primarily loans taken out by the children of middle- or low-income families trying to better themselves through education . Bernie Sanders , running for president , has pledged to eliminate all student debt , paying for it with taxes on the wealthy , and to make all public colleges tuition free . Elizabeth Warren has joined in a plan to eliminate the debt for most students and make colleges tuition free .\nTrump is reportedly worried that these plans are very popular . His administration is scrambling to respond . One proposal , as the Washington Post reported , is to cap the loans a student could get in relation to their projected income . That \u2019 s right , the Trump plan may call for reducing student debt by cutting the availability of loans to students \u2014 effectively closing the doors to college to the children of middle- and low-income families .\nAdd to this Trump \u2019 s most recent plan to take $ 2 billion out of the Pell Grant program \u2014 which supports college grants to children from families with less than $ 50,000 in income \u2014 to pay for sending NASA back to the moon . The maximum Pell Grant once covered nearly 80 % of the cost of tuition , fees , room and board at public four-year college ; now it covers less than 30 % .\nThis is a program that needs more funding , not less .\nTrump , of course , brags on his economy and the low unemployment . He argues \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that his tax cut is trickling down to workers . What he doesn \u2019 t realize is that this economy continues to generate jobs that won \u2019 t support a family . That \u2019 s why so-called poverty programs \u2014 from CHIP to food stamps to public housing to low income heating assistance to Medicaid \u2014 are so necessary . They give vital support to low-wage workers who do some of the hardest , most taxing jobs in our country .\nCuts in student aid , cuts in Pell grants , cuts in food stamps , cuts in the poverty level \u2014 Trump is putting low wage workers and their families in a box with no way out except down . Our country is paying a very high price for this meanness .", "Approximately 6.1 million individuals dropped off the food stamp rolls since President Donald Trump \u2019 s first full month in office in February 2017 , according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .\nThe USDA data showed that 6,074,074 individuals discontinued their participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) between February 2017\u2014 when the president completed his first full month in office\u2014 and November 2019 .\nHousehold participation in SNAP declined as well , with 2,489,315 households discontinuing SNAP .\nThere are currently 36,223,717 individuals and 18,448,588 households that are participating in SNAP .\nWhen Trump took office , 42,297,791 individuals and 20,937,903 households were enrolled in SNAP .\nTrump recently made it a point in his annual State of the Union address to stress that he helped the poor move off welfare to find jobs with his recent enactment of work requirements .\nUnder these work requirements , which had been enacted at the state level during the Obama years , those between the ages of 18-49 and without children or dependents who receive food stamps for more than three months in a 36-month period must work , go to school , receive job training , or volunteer to receive benefits .\nAnother way the USDA has been trying to keep enrollment in the food stamp program down is through the use of data-mining practices to identify food stamp fraud .\nAccording to a report from the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , computer algorithms went through SNAP purchase data in seven states and matched it up with retailer and eligibility data to see if there was fraud .\nIn Mississippi , the state reported $ 2 million in SNAP overpayments since the state started incorporating data-mining into its fraud detection efforts .\nBut the study was limited , as all seven states said high costs , data limitations , and organizational support affected their ability to use more advanced artificial intelligence-gathering techniques to ferret out fraud .\nOther states , however , have done similar things with analytics for different welfare programs at the state level . Utah became one of the first states to modernize its unemployment insurance analytics system in 2006 after spending $ 14 million to overhaul it . In 2015 , the state had one of the lowest fraud rates in the country at 1.3 percent .", "U.S. officials turned away a 17-year-old Palestinian incoming Harvard freshman last week after he was questioned about his friends \u2019 social media posts , according to the Harvard Crimson .\nThe 17-year-old , a resident of Tyre , Lebanon , was deported about eight hours after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston and said in a written statement obtained by the Crimson that immigration officials questioned him for hours and searched his phone and computer .\nThe teen , whom \u2588\u2588\u2588 is not naming because he is a minor , said he was questioned on his religious practices and instructed to unlock his devices , according to the Crimson .\nAfter about five hours , he said , an immigration official \u201c called me into a room , and she started screaming at me .

Pompeo spoke about Iran , Iraq , Israeli settlements in the West Bank , protests in Hong Kong , and Bolivia , among other topics . ( AP Photo/Andrew Harnik )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday said it no longer considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be a violation of international law , reversing four decades of American policy and further undermining the Palestinians \u2019 effort to gain statehood .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. is repudiating the 1978 State Department legal opinion that held that civilian settlements in the occupied territories are \u201c inconsistent with international law. \u201d Israeli leaders welcomed the decision while Palestinians and other nations warned that it undercut any chance of a broader peace deal .\nPompeo told reporters at the State Department that the Trump administration believes any legal questions about settlements should be resolved by Israeli courts and that declaring them a violation of international law distracts from larger efforts to negotiate a peace deal .\n\u201c Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace , \u201d Pompeo said . \u201c The hard truth is that there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict , and arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace . \u201d\nThe change reflects the administration \u2019 s embrace of a hard-line Israeli view at the expense of the Palestinian quest for statehood . Similar actions have included President Donald Trump \u2019 s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital , the movement of the U.S. Embassy to that city and the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington .\n\u201c The U.S. administration has lost its credibility to play any future role in the peace process , \u201d said Nabil Abu Rdeneh , a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .\nThe European Union warned of the potential repercussions in a statement following the announcement that did not mention the U.S .\n\u201c All settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace , \u201d said the statement from the 28-nation bloc . \u201c The EU calls on Israel to end all settlement activity , in line with its obligations as an occupying power . \u201d\nEven though the decision is largely symbolic , it could give a boost to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is fighting for his political survival after failing to form a coalition government following recent elections .\nIt could also spell further trouble for the administration \u2019 s peace plan , which is unlikely to gather much international support by endorsing a position contrary to the global consensus .\nThe Netanyahu government was dealt a blow on settlements just last week when the European Court of Justice ruled products made in Israeli settlements must be labeled as such .\nThe 1978 legal opinion on settlements is known as the Hansell Memorandum . It had been the basis for more than 40 years of carefully worded U.S. opposition to settlement construction that had varied in its tone and strength , depending on the president \u2019 s position .\nThe international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements illegal based in part on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which bars an occupying power from transferring parts of its own civilian population to occupied territory .\nIn the final days of the Obama administration , the U.S. allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution declaring the settlements a \u201c flagrant violation \u201d of international law .\nPompeo said that the U.S. would not take a position on the legality of specific settlements , that the new policy would not extend beyond the West Bank and that it would not create a precedent for other territorial disputes .\nHe also said the decision did not mean the administration was prejudging the status of the West Bank in any eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement .\nFor Netanyahu , the welcome boost comes at a time when he has been weakened domestically by mounting legal woes and two inconclusive elections this year .\nUnable to secure a parliamentary majority , Netanyahu is now anxiously waiting to see if his chief rival , Benny Gantz , can put together a coalition . If Gantz fails , the country could be forced into a third election , with Netanyahu facing the distraction of a trial .\nNetanyahu \u2019 s office released a statement saying the policy shift \u201c rights a historical wrong \u201d concerning settlements .\n\u201c This policy reflects an historical truth - that the Jewish people are not foreign colonialists in Judea and Samaria , \u201d it said , using the Israeli terms for the West Bank .\nGantz , meanwhile , applauded Pompeo \u2019 s \u201c important statement , once again demonstrating its firm stance with Israel and its commitment to the security and future of the entire Middle East . \u201d\nPompeo dismissed suggestions that the decision would further isolate the U.S. or Israel in the international community , though Jordan \u2019 s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi wrote on Twitter that the settlements hurt peace prospects . \u201c We warn of the seriousness of the change in the U.S. position towards the settlements and its repercussions on all efforts to achieve peace , \u201d he said .\nShortly after Pompeo \u2019 s announcement , the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem issued an advisory warning for Americans planning to travel in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza , saying , \u201c Individuals and groups opposed to ( Pompeo \u2019 s ) announcement may target U.S. government facilities , U.S. private interests , and U.S. citizens. \u201d It called on them \u201c to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in light of the current environment . \u201d\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and quickly began settling the newly conquered territory .\nToday , some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the two areas , which are both claimed by the Palestinians for their state .\nAfter the war , it immediately annexed east Jerusalem , home to the holy city \u2019 s most important religious sites , in a move that is not internationally recognized .\nBut Israel has never annexed the West Bank , even as it has dotted the territory with scores of settlements and tiny settlement outposts .\nWhile claiming the fate of the settlements is a subject for negotiations , it has steadily expanded them . Some major settlements have over 30,000 residents , resembling small cities and serving as suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv .\nThe Palestinians and most of the world say the settlements undermine hopes for a two-state solution by gobbling up land sought by the Palestinians .\nIsrael \u2019 s settlement activities have also drawn attention to its treatment of Palestinians .\nWhile Jewish settlers can freely enter Israel and vote in Israeli elections , West Bank Palestinians are subject to Israeli military law , require permits to enter Israel and do not have the right to vote in Israeli elections .", "The Palestinians on Saturday edged closer to a diplomatic standoff with the Trump administration , saying the U.S. is using \u201c extortion \u201d tactics by threatening to close their diplomatic mission in Washington .\nThe response follows the State Department saying Friday that the Palestine Liberation Organization 's office in Washington will close because the Palestinians have run afoul of a U.S. law by calling for Israelis to be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court .\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki told Palestine Radio that his people wo n't cave to `` extortion '' and that they await further communication from the administration .\n\u201c The ball is now in the American court , '' he said .\nIn addition , Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said this weekend that the administration 's decision is `` very unfortunate and unacceptable . ''\nErekat also accused the administration of bowing to pressure from the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while the Palestinians are `` trying to cooperate to achieve the ultimate deal . ''\nErekat said the Palestinians conveyed in a letter to the administration their intention to cut off talks if the office is closed .\nNetanyahu 's office says the closure is a `` matter of U.S . law . ''\nTrump has made brokering a long-sought Middle East peace deal a top priority , with senior White House adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner taking the lead .\nThe president has also sought to strengthen relations with Netanyahu , with whom former President Barack Obama had a weak relationship .\nStill , Trump has also apparently tried to improve ties with Mahmoud Abbas , the leader of the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority .\nThe president talked to Abbas in September at a United Nations meeting in New York .\nThe State Department could not be reached Saturday for comment .\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly determined that the Palestinians ran afoul of an obscure provision in a U.S. law that states the PLO \u2019 s mission must close if the Palestinians try to get the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians .\nA State Department official said that Abbas crossed that line in September by calling on the ICC to investigate and prosecute Israelis .\nHowever , the official also said the administration is not severing relations with the PLO or the Palestinian Authority and that the closing of the mission should not be interpreted as the administration backing away from trying to reach a peace agreement .", "Rep.

Their study covered conspiracy theories about the Boston bombings , misleading reports on natural disasters , unfounded business rumors and incorrect scientific claims . There is an inundation of false medical advice online , for example , that encourages people to avoid life-saving treatments such as vaccines and promotes unproven therapies . ( Gwyneth Paltrow 's Goop is just one example . )\nThe researchers concluded that `` falsehood diffused significantly farther , faster , deeper , and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information .

Older is not always wiser .\nThe psychological research does , however , offer us a silver lining to this storm cloud , with various experiments demonstrating that people can learn to be better lie detectors with a little training in critical thinking .\nThese efforts are often called `` inoculations , '' since they use a real-life example in one domain to teach people about the strategies used to spread lies and therefore equipping people to spot them more easily . Educating people about the tobacco industry 's attempts to question the medical consensus on smoking , for example , led people to be more skeptical of articles denying climate change , according to one study .\nAnother project aimed to inoculate students at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , involved a course on misinformation throughout history . The class was taught about everything from the myth that aliens somehow built the Egyptian pyramids to the theories that NASA 's moon landings were faked . Along the way , the students had to identify the erroneous logic that helped create the arguments , and the motivations that may lead some people to spread those ideas .\nFollowing the course , the students were less likely to believe in a range of false beliefs that were not even covered in the course , such as the idea that 9/11 was an inside job . The inoculation appeared to be equipping them with a general skepticism that seems to escape traditional education .\nIf you would like to improve your own lie detection , a good first step is to learn the common logical fallacies -- red herrings , appeals to ignorance , straw men and `` ad populum '' appeals to the bandwagon -- that purveyors of misinformation may use to create the illusion of truth .\nThe Book of Bad Arguments is a free online resource that provides a good introduction to those terms , according to Alicia McGill , who taught the `` inoculation '' course on misinformation throughout history at North Carolina State University .\nQuestions to ask yourself when confronted with possible fake news\nWhen examining a new claim , you would do well to ask yourself the following questions :\n\u2022 Who is making the claim ? What are their credentials ? And what might be their motives to make me think this ?\n\u2022 What are the premises of the claim ? And how might they be flawed ?\n\u2022 What are my own initial assumptions ? And how might they be flawed ?\n\u2022 What is the evidence of their claim and how well do they fit with the opposing explanations ?\n\u2022 What further information do you need before you can make a judgment ?\nYou could also try basic strategies such as cross-checking different outlets and finding the original source of a claim . You might also look at independent fact-checking websites used in the MIT study such as Snopes PolitiFact and TruthOrFiction.com\nAnd pay particular attention to the way the information is presented . We tend to show more faith in a claim if it is accompanied by a photo , for instance -- even if it adds no additional evidence to the particular claim at hand . ( A headline about a celebrity death is more believable , for example , if it appears next to a generic stock image of the person . )\nIt is also important to be aware of our own partisan biases . We are more likely to believe something if it confirms our existing world view , while we will happily dismiss anything that disagrees with our pre-existing beliefs .\nGet CNN Health 's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team .\nThe psychological literature offers us one good strategy against bias , called the `` consider the opposite `` method . This involves asking yourself whether you would have been so credulous of a claim if its opinions had differed from your own . And if not , what kind of additional scrutiny might you have applied ? This should help you to identify the weaknesses in your own thinking .\nHoning these skills will not just reduce embarrassment when discussing the news with your friends or co-workers . Studies have found that someone 's critical thinking skills can protect them from flawed decisions in all areas of life , from being misled by a fad diet , to falling for scams , getting in debt and even landing in jail .\nBy appraising evidence more rationally , you will avoid being duped by others -- and yourself .\nFalsehoods may fly , but with this lie detection kit , you can better ensure your actions and beliefs remain grounded in the truth .", "( CNN ) \u2013 GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan acknowledged the Republican campaign 's `` missteps '' on Sunday , calling Mitt Romney \u2019 s now-notorious \u201c 47 % \u201d comments \u201c inarticulate , \u201d while still defending the crux of his running mate \u2019 s argument .\nRyan also took the media to task for what he called bias against conservatives .\n- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November .\nAppearing on \u201c Fox News Sunday , \u201d Ryan said his running mate \u2019 s controversial comments were `` an inarticulate way to describe what we \u2019 re trying to do to create prosperity and upward mobility , and reduce dependency by getting people off welfare , back to work . \u201d\n\u201c We 've had some missteps , '' said Ryan , also noting many conservatives ' concerns that the campaign is failing to project a clear message to voters . `` But at the end of the day , the choice is really clear , and we 're giving people a very clear choice .

The editorial was online for over a week until Burdett asked for it to be taken down , citing grammatical errors and a lack of positivity . According to the Eagle , there were two grammatical errors : a missing apostrophe and an extra period .\nBurdett then told Eagle staff that any articles or editorials that went against \u201c community norms \u201d were to be sent to him for approval . The paper started submitting all articles by Burdett , since they felt the policy was unclear .\nOn March 23 , Eagle staff was informed Oglesbee-Petter would not return to Prosper for another school year . According to associate editor Neha Madhira , Burdett did not provide a reason to Oglesbee-Petter . The school is not required to explain the decision because she was under contract .\n\u201c We were extremely concerned , \u201d said Madhira . \u201c We already knew [ Burdett ] wasn \u2019 t on our side . \u201d\n\u201c I think that [ Burdett ] doesn \u2019 t like our adviser , \u201d Stack said . \u201c And I think he is taking it out on our staff .

This policy still remains in place .\n\u201c You have a principal that is upset that the teacher is not teaching how to produce fake news , \u201d Hiestand said . \u201c He is telling the kids , \u2018 You can publish the news as long as it \u2019 s happy news. \u2019 That is the definition of fake news . \u201d\nProsper \u2019 s prior review policy allows the school \u2019 s principal ultimate editorial authority , including the right to block stories from being published .

She then refused to testify , citing her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination . The move angered many who say she should have been forced to answer why the tax agency targeted conservative groups applying for tax exempt status .\nRepublican leaders of that committee , though , now say she waived that right by giving a statement and want to haul her back to testify .\nPressure has been mounting on the administration to take tough action against Lerner , after two other IRS officials were pushed out in the wake of the scandal .\nIn a letter earlier Thursday to IRS Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel , Sens .

The attorney general in that letter said the Mueller probe found President Trump and his campaign didn \u2019 t conspire with Russian interference in the 2016 election but reached no conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice . With the absence of a recommendation , Mr. Barr and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump \u2019 s actions weren \u2019 t criminal .\nDemocrats have demanded access to the full report , which Mr. Barr said he would release , likely next week , after blacking out portions for sensitive information .\n\u201c He \u2019 s being as forthcoming as he can , and so this notion that he \u2019 s trying to mislead people , I think is just completely bizarre , \u201d Mr. Rosenstein said .\nMr. Barr is under intense pressure to quickly produce the edited report amid concerns from Democrats that the attorney general , a longtime advocate of executive-branch authority , is seeking to protect the president from politically damaging information the report may contain . Their worries were heightened after reports that some investigators on Mr. Mueller \u2019 s team had told associates in recent days that they believe the report is more critical of Mr. Trump on the obstruction issue than Mr. Barr indicated in his summary . Mr. Rosenstein wouldn \u2019 t say why Mr. Mueller rendered no conclusion on that critical question .\n\u201c It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said , \u2018 I \u2019 m not going to give you the report , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Rosenstein said . \u201c What he said is , \u2018 Look , it \u2019 s going to take a while to process the report .

After nearly 30 years in the department , Mr. Rosenstein , 54 years old , said he doesn \u2019 t know what he will do next , only that he hopes to start a new job at the end of the summer .\nHis remarks came one day after Mr. Barr said he would form a team to examine the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he termed as \u201c spying \u201d on people associated with the Trump campaign , a characterization Democrats and some former Justice Department officials , including fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey , found disturbing .\nSpeaking at a conference in San Francisco on Thursday , Mr. Comey said , \u201c When I hear that kind of language used , it \u2019 s concerning , because the FBI and Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance . I have never thought of that as spying . \u201d\nIt isn \u2019 t known whether Mr. Barr \u2019 s review will examine any of Mr. Rosenstein \u2019 s actions , namely that he approved an application to ask a court to grant continued surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page , who had long been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence for his communications with Russians .\nMr. Rosenstein wouldn \u2019 t comment on Mr. Barr \u2019 s inquiry of that counterintelligence probe , but he said generally that he is open to objective scrutiny and stands by his approval of the renewal .\nMr. Rosenstein has been under an unusually intense spotlight as the No . 2 Justice Department official , largely because of his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller early in his tenure , which drew repeated swipes from Mr. Trump and concerns among some of the president \u2019 s advisers that he would move to fire the deputy attorney general . Mr. Rosenstein said he has stayed on the job at Mr. Barr \u2019 s request , adding , \u201c for me , it \u2019 s a real privilege . \u201d\nEarly on , at Mr. Trump \u2019 s request , Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo that the White House initially cited as grounds for firing Mr. Comey .

Marshals personnel made a decision to isolate the former Trump adviser from the general inmate population because of concerns about his safety , the judge has said .\nAnd Trump on Tuesday afternoon escalated his vendetta against Vindman , one of the prime targets of the president 's still-emerging revenge tour .\nSpeaking to reporters at a veterans event , Trump said the military will likely look at disciplinary action against Vindman , just days after the National Security Council official was ousted from the White House after giving damaging testimony during the House impeachment hearings .\n\u201c That \u2019 s going to be up to the military , we \u2019 ll have to see , but if you look at what happened , they \u2019 re going to certainly , I would imagine , take a look at that , \u201d Trump said in response to a follow-up question about what he meant when he said , \u201c the military can handle him . \u201d\nTrump , without providing evidence or specific examples , accused Vindman of reporting \u201c very inaccurate things \u201d about the \u201c perfect \u201d call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\nAround the same time Trump was speaking at the White House , the Justice Department submitted a revised sentencing filing that offered no specific recommendation for Stone \u2018 s sentence , but said a term on the order of seven to nine years \u201c could be considered excessive and unwarranted. \u201c\n\u201c The government respectfully submits that a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months \u2019 imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances , \u201c the prosecution \u2018 s new submission said . \u201c Ultimately , the government defers to the Court as to what specific sentence is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case. \u201c\n\u201c Coupled with the president \u2019 s blatant retaliation against those who helped expose his wrongdoing , the Trump administration poses the gravest threat to the rule of law in America in a generation , \u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter on Tuesday to the Justice Department inspector general , Michael Horowitz , requesting an investigation into the reversal .\nA senior Justice Department official said on Tuesday afternoon that department leaders were taken by surprise by the initial recommendation contained in the prosecution \u2018 s Monday evening filing . The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the decision to revise the submission was unrelated to Trump 's tweet and took place prior to the president \u2019 s sending the message .\n\u201c The department was shocked to see the sentencing recommendation in the Stone case last night , \u201c said the official . \u201c That recommendation was not the recommendation that had been briefed to the department . The department found the recommendation to be extreme and excessive and grossly disproportionate to Stone \u2019 s offenses and the department will clarify its position in court later today. \u201c\nThe official declined to elaborate on who in the Justice Department hierarchy was aware of the actual contents of the recommendation submitted to Jackson , who is set to sentence Stone on Feb. 20 . However , the official insisted that the White House played no role in the reversal and that there was no contact between department leaders and Trump about Stone 's potential sentence prior to the decision .\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office declined to address questions about whether the prosecution team was dismissed or quit in protest .\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder praised two of the prosecutors who withdrew from the Stone case .\n\u201c AUSA \u2018 s Kravis and Zelinsky have shown more guts \u2014 and an adherence to the rule of law \u2014 than too many now serving in Washington , \u201d he wrote on Twitter . \u201c What Main DOJ is trying to do \u2014 and at whose behest ? \u2014 is unprecedented , wrong and ultimately dangerous . DOJ independence is critical . \u201d\nGrant Smith , an attorney for Stone , said in a statement : \u201c We have read with interest the new reporting on Roger Stone \u2019 s case . Our sentencing memo outlined our position on the recommendation made yesterday by the government . We look forward to reviewing the government \u2019 s supplemental filing. \u201c\n`` Isn \u2019 t it lovely when the swamp drains itself ?

Shea \u2018 s name appeared on Monday 's filing , although such filings are typically prepared by the line prosecutors on the case .\nLiu also appeared to become a casualty of the latest developments in the Stone case , as the White House abruptly withdrew her nomination as the Treasury Department \u2018 s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes , according to a former Trump administration official and another person familiar with the situation .\nIt was not immediately clear why Trump pulled her nomination , but her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee had been scheduled for Thursday morning . A White House spokesman declined to comment on the move .\nA former Trump administration official said on Tuesday night : \u201c It was unusual to ask her to step down ahead of her confirmation. \u201c\nEven before the new and extraordinary events in the Stone case , Liu was virtually certain to face questions at the hearing about her office \u2018 s handling of various politically sensitive cases and investigations , including those of Stone , former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe .\nThe prosecution \u2018 s initial proposal for a lengthy prison term for Stone was driven by the witness tampering charge and by allegations that Stone threatened violence in order to discourage an associate , Randy Credico , from cooperating with Congress and the FBI . Stone insisted that the messages \u2014 including such colorful missives as \u201c Prepare to die cocksucker \u201c \u2014 were part of outlandish banter between the two .\nCredico said in a letter to the judge last month that he didn \u2018 t think Stone posed a physical threat , but acknowledged during the trial that he was concerned that Stone \u2018 s language could prompt other people to act out .\nStone \u2018 s statements alleged to threaten or encourage violence upped the prosecution \u2018 s calculation of the sentencing guidelines in Stone \u2018 s case by about four or five years , according to the government \u2018 s filing Monday . Stone \u2018 s defense calculates the guidelines to call for a 15- to 21-month sentence .\nTrump has the power to see that Stone serves no prison time by issuing a pardon , as many of Stone \u2018 s supporters are urging . The president rebuffed a question about a pardon on Tuesday .\nJed and Kravis offered no hint of the mushrooming controversy during the more than two hours they spent in court on Tuesday handling another case that emerged from the Mueller probe : the prosecution of a Russian company accused of using social media activity and advertising to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential contest .

Chairman , I see that your five minutes is up , \u201d Whitaker said , in a bold challenge to the head of the committee . \u201c I am here voluntarily . We have agreed to five-minute rounds , \u201d he added .\n\u201c How the heck did you become the head of the Department of Justice ? \u201d Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries later railed at Whitaker .\nTrump \u2019 s naming of Whitaker as acting attorney general caused controversy in part because it meant that the president \u2019 s appointee oversees the probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with Trump \u2019 s campaign .\nRelated Coverage Whitaker says did not previously discuss Russia probe with Trump , associates\nWhitaker had publicly criticized the investigation before joining the Justice Department in 2017 but said on Friday he had not discussed it with Trump .\n\u201c I have not talked to the president of the United States about the special counsel \u2019 s investigation , \u201d Whitaker said .\nDemocrats repeatedly accused Whitaker of running out the clock by giving them evasive or rambling answers in the hearing .\nIn one case , he refused to answer Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee \u2019 s questions with a yes or no , and made a flippant remark about whether the time she had lost on the clock had been restored before he answered her questions .\n\u201c Mr . Attorney General , we are not joking here and your humor is not acceptable , \u201d she said .\nWhitaker testified he had never spoken with members of Trump \u2019 s inner circle about his views on the probe as a private citizen before he joined the Justice Department .\nTrump has repeatedly said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia and has called Mueller \u2019 s investigation a witch hunt .\nPolitical drama erupted on Thursday when Democrats threatened to serve Whitaker a subpoena if he failed to answer certain questions at the hearing .\nNadler later agreed to drop the threat , after Whitaker said he would back out from testifying if the subpoena was served .\nActing U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker testifies before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Justice Department on Capitol Hill in Washington , U.S. , February 8 , 2019 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\nDuring the hearing on Friday , Nadler threatened to force Whitaker to go back in front of the committee for a deposition .\nCongressman Doug Collins , the top Republican on the committee , accused Democrats of staging political drama .\n\u201c Bring your popcorn , \u201d he said . Collins repeatedly tried to cut Democrats off from asking questions unrelated to Whitaker \u2019 s current role at the department .\nJustice Department ethics officials had recommended Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation , a step he chose not to take .\n\u201c When career officials at the department recommended that you take steps to mitigate your apparent conflicts of interest , ... you ignored them , \u201d Nadler said .\n\u201c Ultimately , the decision whether or not to recuse was my decision . \u201d\nWhen pressed on whether he trusted Mueller , he told lawmakers he has respect for the former FBI Director .\n\u201c I have been on the record about my respect for Bob Mueller , \u201d Whitaker said . \u201c I have no reason to believe he is not honest . \u201d\nWhitaker also denied media reports that Trump lashed out at him after learning his former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen was pleading guilty for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow .\nFriday was likely the first and last time that Whitaker will testify as acting attorney general .\nTrump \u2019 s nominee for attorney general , William Barr , is expected to face a Senate confirmation vote next week .", "\u2022 US and UK spy agencies piggyback on commercial data \u2022 Details can include age , location and sexual orientation \u2022 Documents also reveal targeted tools against individual phones\nThe National Security Agency and its UK counterpart GCHQ have been developing capabilities to take advantage of `` leaky '' smartphone apps , such as the wildly popular Angry Birds game , that transmit users ' private information across the internet , according to top secret documents .\nThe data pouring onto communication networks from the new generation of iPhone and Android apps ranges from phone model and screen size to personal details such as age , gender and location . Some apps , the documents state , can share users ' most sensitive information such as sexual orientation \u2013 and one app recorded in the material even sends specific sexual preferences such as whether or not the user may be a swinger .\nMany smartphone owners will be unaware of the full extent this information is being shared across the internet , and even the most sophisticated would be unlikely to realise that all of it is available for the spy agencies to collect .\nDozens of classified documents , provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by whistleblower Edward Snowden and reported in partnership with the New York Times and ProPublica , detail the NSA and GCHQ efforts to piggyback on this commercial data collection for their own purposes .\nScooping up information the apps are sending about their users allows the agencies to collect large quantities of mobile phone data from their existing mass surveillance tools \u2013 such as cable taps , or from international mobile networks \u2013 rather than solely from hacking into individual mobile handsets .\nExploiting phone information and location is a high-priority effort for the intelligence agencies , as terrorists and other intelligence targets make substantial use of phones in planning and carrying out their activities , for example by using phones as triggering devices in conflict zones . The NSA has cumulatively spent more than $ 1bn in its phone targeting efforts .\nThe disclosures also reveal how much the shift towards smartphone browsing could benefit spy agencies ' collection efforts .\nOne slide from a May 2010 NSA presentation on getting data from smartphones \u2013 breathlessly titled `` Golden Nugget ! '' \u2013 sets out the agency 's `` perfect scenario '' : `` Target uploading photo to a social media site taken with a mobile device . What can we get ? ''\nThe question is answered in the notes to the slide : from that event alone , the agency said it could obtain a `` possible image '' , email selector , phone , buddy lists , and `` a host of other social working data as well as location '' .\nIn practice , most major social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , strip photos of identifying location metadata ( known as EXIF data ) before publication . However , depending on when this is done during upload , such data may still , briefly , be available for collection by the agencies as it travels across the networks .\nDepending on what profile information a user had supplied , the documents suggested , the agency would be able to collect almost every key detail of a user 's life : including home country , current location ( through geolocation ) , age , gender , zip code , marital status \u2013 options included `` single '' , `` married '' , `` divorced '' , `` swinger '' and more \u2013 income , ethnicity , sexual orientation , education level , and number of children .\nThe agencies also made use of their mobile interception capabilities to collect location information in bulk , from Google and other mapping apps . One basic effort by GCHQ and the NSA was to build a database geolocating every mobile phone mast in the world \u2013 meaning that just by taking tower ID from a handset , location information could be gleaned .\nA more sophisticated effort , though , relied on intercepting Google Maps queries made on smartphones , and using them to collect large volumes of location information .\nSo successful was this effort that one 2008 document noted that `` [ i ] t effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system . ''\nThe information generated by each app is chosen by its developers , or by the company that delivers an app 's adverts . The documents do not detail whether the agencies actually collect the potentially sensitive details some apps are capable of storing or transmitting , but any such information would likely qualify as content , rather than metadata .\nData collected from smartphone apps is subject to the same laws and minimisation procedures as all other NSA activity \u2013 procedures that the US president , Barack Obama , suggested may be subject to reform in a speech 10 days ago . But the president focused largely on the NSA 's collection of the metadata from US phone calls and made no mention in his address of the large amounts of data the agency collects from smartphone apps .\nThe latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information , especially for those outside the US , who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans . A January poll for the Washington Post showed 69 % of US adults were already concerned about how tech companies such as Google used and stored their information .\nThe documents do not make it clear how much of the information that can be taken from apps is routinely collected , stored or searched , nor how many users may be affected . The NSA says it does not target Americans and its capabilities are deployed only against `` valid foreign intelligence targets '' .\nThe documents do set out in great detail exactly how much information can be collected from widely popular apps . One document held on GCHQ 's internal Wikipedia-style guide for staff details what can be collected from different apps . Though it uses Android apps for most of its examples , it suggests much of the same data could be taken from equivalent apps on iPhone or other platforms .\nThe GCHQ documents set out examples of what information can be extracted from different ad platforms , using perhaps the most popular mobile phone game of all time , Angry Birds \u2013 which has reportedly been downloaded more than 1.7bn times \u2013 as a case study .\nFrom some app platforms , relatively limited , but identifying , information such as exact handset model , the unique ID of the handset , software version , and similar details are all that are transmitted .\nOther apps choose to transmit much more data , meaning the agency could potentially net far more . One mobile ad platform , Millennial Media , appeared to offer particularly rich information . Millennial Media 's website states it has partnered with Rovio on a special edition of Angry Birds ; with Farmville maker Zynga ; with Call of Duty developer Activision , and many other major franchises .\nRovio , the maker of Angry Birds , said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs looking to extract data from its apps users .\n`` Rovio does n't have any previous knowledge of this matter , and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks , '' said Saara Bergstr\u00f6m , Rovio 's VP of marketing and communications . `` Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned [ NSA and GCHQ ] . ''\nMillennial Media did not respond to a request for comment .\nIn December , the Washington Post reported on how the NSA could make use of advertising tracking files generated through normal internet browsing \u2013 known as cookies \u2013 from Google and others to get information on potential targets .\nHowever , the richer personal data available to many apps , coupled with real-time geolocation , and the uniquely identifying handset information many apps transmit give the agencies a far richer data source than conventional web-tracking cookies .\nAlmost every major website uses cookies to serve targeted advertising and content , as well as streamline the experience for the user , for example by managing logins . One GCHQ document from 2010 notes that cookie data \u2013 which generally qualifies as metadata \u2013 has become just as important to the spies . In fact , the agencies were sweeping it up in such high volumes that their were struggling to store it .\n`` They are gathered in bulk , and are currently our single largest type of events , '' the document stated .\nThe ability to obtain targeted intelligence by hacking individual handsets has been well documented , both through several years of hacker conferences and previous NSA disclosures in Der Spiegel , and both the NSA and GCHQ have extensive tools ready to deploy against iPhone , Android and other phone platforms .\nGCHQ 's targeted tools against individual smartphones are named after characters in the TV series The Smurfs . An ability to make the phone 's microphone 'hot ' , to listen in to conversations , is named `` Nosey Smurf '' . High-precision geolocation is called `` Tracker Smurf '' , power management \u2013 an ability to stealthily activate an a phone that is apparently turned off \u2013 is `` Dreamy Smurf '' , while the spyware 's self-hiding capabilities are codenamed `` Paranoid Smurf '' .\nThose capability names are set out in a much broader 2010 presentation that sheds light on spy agencies ' aspirations for mobile phone interception , and that less-documented mass-collection abilities .\nThe cover sheet of the document sets out the team 's aspirations :\nAnother slide details weak spots in where data flows from mobile phone network providers to the wider internet , where the agency attempts to intercept communications . These are locations either within a particular network , or international roaming exchanges ( known as GRXs ) , where data from travellers roaming outside their home country is routed .\nThese are particularly useful to the agency as data is often only weakly encrypted on such networks , and includes extra information such as handset ID or mobile number \u2013 much stronger target identifiers than usual IP addresses or similar information left behind when PCs and laptops browse the internet .\nThe NSA said its phone interception techniques are only used against valid targets , and are subject to stringent legal safeguards .\n`` The communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets are not of interest to the National Security Agency , '' said a spokeswoman in a statement .\n`` Any implication that NSA 's foreign intelligence collection is focused on the smartphone or social media communications of everyday Americans is not true . Moreover , NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission . We collect only those communications that we are authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes \u2013 regardless of the technical means used by the targets .\n`` Because some data of US persons may at times be incidentally collected in NSA 's lawful foreign intelligence mission , privacy protections for US persons exist across the entire process concerning the use , handling , retention , and dissemination of data . In addition , NSA actively works to remove extraneous data , to include that of innocent foreign citizens , as early as possible in the process .\n`` Continuous and selective publication of specific techniques and tools lawfully used by NSA to pursue legitimate foreign intelligence targets is detrimental to the security of the United States and our allies \u2013 and places at risk those we are sworn to protect . ''\nThe NSA declined to respond to a series of queries on how routinely capabilities against apps were deployed , or on the specific minimisation procedures used to prevent US citizens ' information being stored through such measures .\nGCHQ declined to comment on any of its specific programs , but stressed all of its activities were proportional and complied with UK law .\n`` It is a longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters , '' said a spokesman .\n`` Furthermore , all of GCHQ 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework that ensures that our activities are authorised , necessary and proportionate , and that there is rigorous oversight , including from the Secretary of State , the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee . All our operational processes rigorously support this position . ''\n\u2022 A separate disclosure on Wednesday , published by Glenn Greenwald and NBC News , gave examples of how GCHQ was making use of its cable-tapping capabilities to monitor YouTube and social media traffic in real-time .\nGCHQ \u2019 s cable-tapping and internet buffering capabilities , codenamed Tempora , were disclosed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 in June , but the new documents published by NBC from a GCHQ presentation titled \u201c Psychology : A New Kind of SIGDEV '' set out a program codenamed Squeaky Dolphin which gave the British spies \u201c broad real-time monitoring \u201d of \u201c YouTube Video Views \u201d , \u201c URLs \u2018 Liked \u2019 on Facebook \u201d and \u201c Blogspot/Blogger Visits \u201d .\nA further slide noted that \u201c passive \u201d \u2013 a term for large-scale surveillance through cable intercepts \u2013 give the agency \u201c scalability \u201d .\nThe means of interception mean GCHQ and NSA could obtain data without any knowledge or co-operation from the technology companies . Spokespeople for the NSA and GCHQ told NBC all programs were carried out in accordance with US and UK law .\n\u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2014 . It referred to martial status , instead of marital status . This has been corrected .", "NSA 's Bulk Collection Of Americans ' Phone Data Is Illegal , Appeals Court Rules\nThe National Security Agency 's practice of collecting data about Americans ' telephone calls in bulk goes beyond what Congress intended when it wrote Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act , a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday .\nThe three-judge panel was asked to consider whether the program violated the Constitution . Instead , the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals panel punted on the constitutional claim , deciding the program was simply not authorized by federal law .\nOne of the big reasons it is hard to discern congressional intent in this case , the court wrote , is that the bulk collection program has been shrouded in secrecy . So it can not `` reasonably be said '' that Congress OK 'd `` a program of which many members of Congress \u2014 and all members of the public \u2014 were not aware . ''\nThe court concludes that it has no qualms about taking this step because if Congress wants to `` authorize such a far\u2010reaching and unprecedented program , it has every opportunity to do so , and to do so unambiguously . ''\nAccording to The New York Times , this is `` the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the program , which since 2006 has repeatedly been approved in secret by a national security court . ''\nThe NSA 's collection of phone metadata came back into the spotlight after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that shed light on the scope of the program .\nOne of the first leaked documents was a secret court ruling that ordered Verizon to hand over the telephone metadata of all its customers . Metadata does not mean the content of calls . Instead it means things like time , phone numbers and duration of calls .\nThe panel has vacated a lower court 's decision to dismiss the case and has sent it back for further review . The panel also refused to order a preliminary end to the program , saying Congress is currently debating the NSA 's bulk collection program .\n`` We deem it prudent to pause to allow an opportunity for debate in Congress that may ( or may not ) profoundly alter the legal landscape , '' the panel wrote .\nUpdate at 11:47 a.m . ET . Obama Believes Bulk Collection Should End :\nWithout specifically commenting on the court 's ruling , Ned Price , a spokesman for the White House National Security Council , said President Obama has already expressed a preference for ending the bulk collection of metadata as it exists today .\nAs we reported back in January 2014 , Obama said he would prefer that the government not keep a massive database of Americans ' telephone data . Instead , the data could live elsewhere and the U.S. government could query the information based on each investigation .\n`` We continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that and we have been encouraged by good progress on bipartisan , bicameral legislation that would implement these important reforms , '' Price said in a statement .\nUpdate at 11:44 a.m . ET . 'Resounding Victory For The Rule Of Law ' :\n`` This decision is a resounding victory for the rule of law , '' ACLU Staff Attorney Alex Abdo , who argued the case before the three-judge panel last September , said in a statement . `` For years , the government secretly spied on millions of innocent Americans based on a shockingly broad interpretation of its authority . The court rightly rejected the government 's theory that it may stockpile information on all of us in case that information proves useful in the future . Mass surveillance does not make us any safer , and it is fundamentally incompatible with the privacy necessary in a free society . ''\nThe ACLU also urged Congress to `` up its reform game '' to align itself with the concerns raised by the 2nd Circuit .\nThe panel argued that when Congress passed the Patriot Act , it could not have understood the sweeping nature of the program . The panel explains :\n`` Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans . Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism . But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate , and expressed in unmistakable language . There is no evidence of such a debate in the legislative history of \u00a7 215 , and the language of the statute , on its face , is not naturally read as permitting investigative agencies , on the approval of the FISC [ the secret national security court ] , to do any more than obtain the sorts of information routinely acquired in the course of criminal investigations of 'money laundering [ and ] drug dealing . ' ``\nUpdate at 9:57 a.m . ET . Echoes Some Members Of Congress :\nNPR 's David Welna , who covers national security for the network , tells us the ruling echoes what some members of Congress have been saying . David reports :", "I have been writing for years about the dangers to human freedom that come from government mass surveillance . The United States was born in a defiant reaction to government surveillance . In the decade preceding the signing of the Declaration of Independence , the villains were the Stamp Act and the Writs of Assistance Act .\nIn 1765 , when the British government was looking for creative ways to tax the colonists , Parliament enacted the Stamp Act . That law required all persons in the colonies to purchase stamps from a British government vendor and to affix them to all documents in one 's possession . These were not stamps as we use today , rather they bore the seal of the British government . The vendor would apply ink to the seal and for a fee \u2014 a tax \u2014 impress an image of the seal onto documents .\nAll documents in one 's possession \u2014 financial , legal , letters , books , newspapers , pamphlets , even posters destined to be nailed to trees \u2014 required the government stamps .\nHow did the British government , 3,000 miles away , know if one had its stamps on one 's documents ? Answer : The Writs of Assistance Act . A writ of assistance was a general warrant issued by a secret court in London . A general warrant does not specifically describe the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized . It merely authorized the bearer \u2014 a civilian or military government official \u2014 to search where he wished and seize whatever he found .\nThe use of writs of assistance ostensibly to search colonial homes for stamps produced an avalanche of opposition that often turned to violence against the stamp vendors . The sheer cost of invading private homes fueled fears that the true purpose of the tax was not to generate revenue \u2014 though the king always needed cash \u2014 rather , it was to remind the colonists that the king was sovereign and his agents and soldiers could enter colonial homes on a whim .\nParliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 , but it had caused lasting harm to the king . Harvard Professor Bernard Bailyn has estimated that by the late 1760s , one-third of the colonists favored secession from Great Britain , either peaceful or violent .\nIn 1789 , six years after the American Revolution was won , the 13 colonies that had seceded combined into the United States of America under the Constitution . Two years later , the Bill of Rights was ratified , the Fourth Amendment of which was expressly written to prohibit general warrants \u2014 to assure that the new government would not and could not do to Americans what the British government had done to the colonists .\nThat assurance was manifested in the amendment 's requirements that only judges can issue search warrants , which must be based on probable cause of crime and which must specifically describe the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized .\nThe history of the United States is the history of the growth of government and the loss of personal liberty . Thankfully , we eradicated slavery and recognized the equality of all people , irrespective of race or gender . Yet , in times of crisis , we have supinely permitted the federal government to invade our privacy on a scale never approached by the folks who brought the Stamp Act to our ancestors .\nAfter 9/11 , the George W. Bush administration offered the Patriot Act to Congress .\nIt was crafted in secrecy and enacted in infidelity to the Constitution . Members of the House of Representatives had 15 minutes to read is 300 plus pages and no time for serious floor debate . The one senator who spoke out against it was driven from office .\nSection 505 of the Patriot Act permits federal agents to bypass the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and to issue their own search warrants . Those agent-written warrants are not based on probable cause of crime but rather on a representation by one agent to another of governmental needs \u2014 the same lame standard used by the secret London courts that issued writs of assistance .\nSince 2001 , federal agents have issued more than 300,000 of these search warrants \u2014 which they call National Security Letters \u2014 to custodians of financial records . In 2004 alone , 56,507 agent-written search warrants were issued . Those custodians include financial institutions , telecom providers , computer service providers , supermarkets , credit card issuers , health care insurers and providers , legal service providers , local and state governments , and even the Post Office .\nThe very concept of one federal agent authorizing another to seize records is antithetical to the Fourth Amendment and repugnant to the American Revolution .\nI am writing about this now because a section of the Patriot Act will expire on March 15 , and many congressional liberals and libertarians \u2014 even a few conservatives still bruised at the governmental surveillance of candidate Donald Trump in 2016 \u2014 have been contemplating structural changes to this pernicious law .\nSection 215 \u2014 which is about to expire \u2014 is as fatal to freedom as is section 505 . It permits designated federal judges to issue general warrants based on the old writs of assistance standard of governmental need . One of those judges signed a search warrant for the telephone records of all Verizon customers in the U.S. \u2014 at the time , 115 million of them .\nBoth 215 and 505 are weapons of mass surveillance and should be repealed . They are instruments of a totalitarian government , not of free people . They defy the Constitution . They presume that our rights are not natural but come from a government that can take them back . Mass surveillance produces a state that knows more about us than we do about it \u2014 one that will slowly consume our freedoms in the name of governmental needs . It already has .\nJudge Andrew P.

'' `` FRANCES ... IS HPV POSITIVE ! ''\nThe public missive from January 2014 gave Frances ' full name , along with the revelation that she had human papillomavirus , a sexually transmitted disease that can cause genital warts and cancer . It also included her date of birth and ended with a plea to friends : `` PLZ HELP EXPOSE THIS HOE ! ''\nWithin hours , a friend told Frances that a former high school pal who lived near her in northwest Indiana had shared a secret that only her family and a former boyfriend knew , she later said .\n`` My heart fell to my stomach , '' said Frances , a dental assistant in her late 20s who asked that her last name not be used . `` I started crying immediately . ''\nThe Facebook poster was a patient care technician at the local hospital where Frances was treated , but the two were no longer friends .\nFrances complained to a nursing supervisor at the hospital , which sent her a letter of apology in March 2014 .\nUnder the federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , or HIPAA , it 's illegal for health care providers to share patients ' treatment information without their permission . The Office for Civil Rights , the arm of the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for enforcing the law , receives more than 30,000 reports about privacy violations each year .\nThe bulk of the government 's enforcement \u2014 and the public 's attention \u2014 has focused on a small number of splashy cases in which hackers or thieves have accessed the health data of large groups of people . But the damage done in these mass breaches has been mostly hypothetical , with much information exposed but little exploited .\nAs Frances discovered , it 's often little-noticed , smaller-scale violations of medical privacy \u2014 the ones that affect only one or two people \u2014 that inflict the most harm .\nDriven by personal animus , jealousy or a desire for retribution , small breaches involving sensitive health details are spurring disputes and legal battles across the country :\nIn Tampa , Fla. , a nurse snooped in the medical records of her nephew 's partner , and learned that she had delivered a baby and had put the child up for adoption . She gave a printout to another family member , and the secret was announced at a family funeral in 2013 , the Tampa Bay Times reported . The nephew 's partner complained to the hospital ; the nurse admitted what she had done , was fired and relinquished her Florida nursing license .\nAnd in New Jersey , a woman sued a local hospital this fall , alleging that one of its employees shared details about her 11-year-old son 's attempted suicide with people at his school . The boy was subsequently `` bullied by his peers , called names and made fun of , '' her lawsuit says .\nEven when small privacy violations have real consequences , the federal Office for Civil Rights rarely punishes health care providers for them . Instead , the office typically settles for pledges to fix any problems and issues reminders of what the privacy law requires . It does n't even tell the public which health providers have reported small breaches \u2014 or how many .\nAsked about some of the privacy violations highlighted in this report , OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels called them `` heartbreaking stories '' and `` the kinds of harm that HIPAA is intended to address . ''\nShe insisted her agency is n't afraid to pursue formal sanctions when they are warranted , but said its primary role is helping health providers to follow the law . `` Our preference is always to promote voluntary compliance , '' Samuels said .\nFor patients , Samuels ' agency is usually the only place they can seek vindication . HIPAA does not give people the right to sue for damages if their privacy is violated . Patients who seek legal redress must find another cause of action , which is easier in some states than in others .\nAfter being attacked on Facebook , Frances contacted Indianapolis lawyer Neal Eggeson . He had won jury verdicts for people whose medical information was improperly disclosed . Eggeson contacted the hospital and , without filing suit , secured a confidential settlement for Frances . ( He asked that the facility not be named in this story . ) Frances ' former friend no longer works there , she said .\nFrances said she still has n't fully recovered . She sees a therapist and has a hard time trusting others .\n`` It 's hard to even still deal with it , '' she said . `` I 'll spend that extra gas money to go into another city to do grocery shopping or stuff like that , just so I do n't have to see anybody from around the neighborhood . ''\nEggeson , a litigator , was defending insurance companies in car accident cases when a `` friend of a friend of a friend '' referred a young man to him . The man , who is HIV positive , had been sued over a $ 326 debt by the medical group that had been treating him . The group 's court filing gave the man 's name , home address , Social Security number and date of birth \u2014 and included a billing statement containing the phrase `` Last Diagnosis : HIV . ''\n`` His first concern was getting the court record sealed , more than anything else , '' Eggeson said . `` I do n't think he had any designs or visions beyond that . ''\nAfter that victory , Eggeson represented Abigail Hinchy , who alleged that a Walgreens pharmacist had snooped in her prescription records and shared the information with the father of Hinchy 's child ( the man was dating and later married the pharmacist ) . Among the data shared : Hinchy had stopped taking birth control pills shortly before she became pregnant . A jury ordered Walgreens and the pharmacist to pay Hinchy $ 1.44 million .\nA copy of Walgreens ' check is framed on the wall of Eggeson 's home office , not far from his life-sized Batman costume and Star Wars lightsabers .\nAmong Eggeson 's current clients is a couple who claim that when their son was in an ATV accident this August , a hospital worker posted a comment on Facebook before the hospital had told them the teen had died . Panicked relatives who saw the post began calling his parents for updates , adding stress to an already wrenching time .\n`` It would n't have changed the outcome , '' said John Stuck , the boy 's father , `` but just the feeling of , 'What in the heck ? What do they know that we do n't ? ' \u2014 that 's what freaked me out I think the most . ''\nWhen Eggeson files lawsuits , he argues that privacy breaches amount to medical malpractice .\nWhile Indiana courts have been receptive to such arguments , courts in Ohio , Minnesota and other states have ruled that health providers are not liable for the actions of workers who snoop in medical records outside the scope of their jobs .\nThis summer , a Los Angeles jury ruled against a patient who sued UCLA and the Regents of the University of California after a romantic rival accessed and shared her medical records . The rival was a temporary worker in the office of a private practice physician affiliated with UCLA 's Santa Monica hospital . The doctor acknowledged improperly sharing his password and settled his part of the lawsuit .\nEggeson said it 's distressing that more states are n't like Indiana .\n`` Privacy protections should be the same regardless of what state you 're in , '' he said . `` There is something wrong with an employer providing the means , providing the access , and providing the tools by which an employee can commit this crime and then being able to hold up their hands and say , 'It 's not our fault . ' ``\nThe vast majority of the federal Office for Civil Rights ' enforcement work has been directed at large-scale medical data breaches , whether or not they result in any demonstrable real-world harm .\nHealth providers are required to notify the office within 60 days of breaches affecting at least 500 people and also must share details with the media and contact those potentially affected . OCR 's website makes public a list of these cases , highlighting them on what industry insiders dub the Wall of Shame .\nRarely do small privacy breaches get anywhere near the same attention , except when they involve celebrities or high-profile individuals .\nOrganizations have to report them to OCR only once a year . Even then , the agency does n't post them online . HHS has rejected requests under the Freedom of Information Act for information about them .\nSince 2009 , OCR has received information about 1,400 large breaches . During the same time , more than 181,000 breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals have been reported .\nIn September , the HHS inspector general issued a pair of reports that criticized the Office for Civil Rights , including its handling of small breaches . The inspector general said OCR did not investigate the small breaches reported to it or log them in its tracking system .\n`` OCR does not record that information and therefore it 's not available for staff to be able to look over time '' for repeat offenders , said Blaine Collins , regional inspector general for evaluation and inspections in San Francisco . `` Boy , that 's critical for monitoring and oversight . ''\nSamuels said that her agency is implementing the inspector general 's recommendations to improve oversight . `` We are constantly looking for ways to better serve the public and improve our operations , '' she said .\nPeter Brabeck , a 73-year-old retired petrophysicist who had worked for the oil giant BP , turned to OCR in September 2011 when he found himself in the midst of a nightmare .\nIt began a year earlier when Brabeck 's brother complained to the Medical Board of California that Dr. Steven Mangar , a pain doctor in Salinas , Calif. , had overprescribed controlled substances to Peter . The medical board accused Mangar of prescribing drugs without examining him and sought to take disciplinary action against Mangar 's license .\nMangar reacted by hiring a private investigator to dig up dirt on Brabeck \u2014 and gave the investigator all of Brabeck 's medical records . When Mangar refused to pay the investigator , he approached Brabeck 's brother and showed him the records . The investigator then offered to sell the records to Peter Brabeck , who within days complained to the Office for Civil Rights .\n`` Here we have not only a gross violation of [ HIPAA ] laws protecting the confidentiality of every patient 's medical history , but in my mind far worse , '' Brabeck wrote in his complaint . `` Here is a deliberate attempt , born of vengeance , with malice aforethought to inflict great harm on his own patient . ''\nTwo years later , the Office for Civil Rights wrote back , saying it was `` pleased to inform '' Brabeck that his complaint has been resolved . It said it had provided Mangar 's clinic , the Pacific Pain Care Institute , with guidance on how to comply with privacy rules . It said Mangar had acknowledged that he `` impermissibly disclosed '' Brabeck 's personal health information to the private investigator .\nOCR also said that Mangar had agreed to provide Brabeck with free credit monitoring .\nBrabeck , who lives near Carmel , Calif. , said he never actually received the credit monitoring . More importantly , he was left with a sense that the agency did n't take his case seriously .\n`` I made very clear in my letter that it was an act of vengeance and retaliation , '' he said . `` That 's why I was so surprised at how lightly they dismissed the whole thing . ''\nMangar did not return calls for comment . California 's medical board placed his license on probation in 2012 and is now seeking to revoke it , saying he violated his probation and provided negligent care to other patients . Earlier this year , federal and state investigators served search warrants at Mangar 's office and home . Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Amy Patterson said Brabeck 's concerns are part of a much broader investigation that she could not discuss because it is ongoing .\nOCR director Samuels said Brabeck 's case predated her arrival at the agency . But she said it was consistent with `` our general principles '' in terms of the nature of the injury , the number of individuals affected and a provider 's lack of prior HIPAA violations . She also said the doctor agreed to apologize , which `` can be very powerful in terms of remedying the damage that has been done . ''\nBrabeck said he did n't get an apology : `` No . Absolutely not . ''\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in New York . This story is part of a yearlong examination into the security of medical information .

But she noted that it was an \u201c admission that the entire system of surveillance is flawed , biased and has racial implications . \u201d\n\u201c We need to make sure this moratorium turns into a permanent ban , \u201d she said , calling on activists and members of the public to apply pressure to their local policymakers to ensure any regulation \u201c serves the people versus corporate interests . \u201d\nThe one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon Rekognition does not include organizations that work closely with law enforcement to identify victims of child sexual exploitation and human trafficking , such as nonprofit Thorn , the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Marinus Analytics .\nIn July 2018 , the ACLU conducted a test of Amazon Rekognition and found it incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress , identifying them as other people who had been arrested for a crime .\nAt the time , Amazon said the ACLU had set the \u201c confidence rate \u201d in the system lower than the recommended level , leading to a higher number of false positives .\n\u201c Machine learning is a very valuable tool to help law enforcement agencies , and while being concerned it \u2019 s applied correctly , we should not throw away the oven because the temperature could be set wrong and burn the pizza , \u201d said the company in a July 2018 statement .\nThe announcement follows a similar pledge from IBM on Monday , when the company \u2019 s CEO Arvind Krishna wrote a letter to Congress stating it would no longer develop or research facial recognition technology .\nKrishna said the company \u201c firmly opposes \u201d the use of facial recognition technology for \u201c mass surveillance , racial profiling , violations of basic human rights and freedoms . \u201d\n\u201c We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies , \u201d he said .", "`` We 've reached kind of an inflection point in the privacy debate , '' says Senator Ron Wyden ( D\u2013Ore. ) . With Americans spending more time online than ever before during the COVID-19 pandemic , he worries that government surveillance of the internet matters more now .\nBefore the Senate 's May 14 vote to reauthorize the USA Freedom Act , formerly known as the PATRIOT Act , Wyden fought a losing battle to rein in the broad authority that it gives U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on the web activities of American citizens .\n`` Americans should n't have their most intimate information\u2026snooped over by the federal government without a warrant , '' says Wyden . `` That [ information ] is private and personal . It might be your dating history . It might be religious beliefs . It might be your fears\u2026It 's like data mining of somebody 's thoughts . ''\nWyden , a Democrat , along with his Republican colleague Steve Daines ( Mont . ) , tried attaching an amendment to the bill that would 've explicitly banned government agents from collecting Americans ' web search histories without a warrant from a non-FISA court . It was defeated by a single vote .\nNow an anti-surveillance activist group called Fight for the Future is trying to convince Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D\u2013Calif . ) and congressional Democrats to add the same amendment to the House version of the bill .\nBut in a political world where Democrats regularly call the president a power-abusing authoritarian in the making and Republicans bemoan a deep state plot to take down Trump , there 's still only weak support for concrete measures to rein in the post-9/11 surveillance state .\n`` Nancy Pelosi has spent the last several years saying that this administration is dangerous . She impeached the president for abuse of power , '' says Evan Greer , deputy director of Fight for the Future . `` If she does n't take this opportunity to get this amendment in place that at least puts some limit on this administration 's surveillance authority , it 's hard not to feel like the entire 'Resistance ' rhetoric has been a bit of a scam . ''\nGreer says Wyden 's introduction of the amendment could be a way of alerting the public that intelligence agencies have already been collecting U.S. citizens ' web search data . Wyden ca n't say that explicitly because that information would be classified .\n`` Senator Wyden has often been sort of a bit of a canary in the coal mine on things like this , '' says Greer . `` He 'll ask very specific questions of intelligence officials when they come to the Hill that sort of get at some of these things . ''\nOne example was Wyden 's questioning of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in 2013 about the bulk collection of Americans ' phone records . When Wyden directly asked Clapper `` does the [ National Security Agency ] collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans , '' Clapper answered , `` No , sir\u2026not wittingly . '' Less than three months later , former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden provided journalists documents showing that the FBI and NSA collected millions of cellphone records .\nWhen \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked Wyden if he could provide evidence that the government has engaged in warrantless surveillance of Americans ' web searches , he said that he could not discuss classified intelligence information but that he has put in requests for public disclosure of any practices of this sort .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R\u2013Ky . ) opposed Wyden in the Senate , claiming that additional limitations to the nation 's surveillance laws would `` jeopardize important tools that keep America safe . ''\nWyden says McConnell 's claim is `` flatly inaccurate '' and that his amendment addresses McConnell 's national security concerns because , during a crisis , law enforcement agencies would still be allowed to gather intelligence before obtaining a warrant .\nA more modest Senate amendment requiring FISA courts to hear analysis from opposing parties , such as the American Civil Liberties Union , was included in the version of the bill that passed . But Republican Sen. Rand Paul 's more radical effort to eliminate the surveillance of American citizens altogether without a warrant from a non-FISA court was defeated 11-85 . Even Wyden voted against it .\n`` I think that Senator Paul started an important conversation\u2026with respect to whether the whole framework needs to be reconsidered , '' says Wyden . `` I 've told him that right now , I think I 've got my hands full trying to make the many reforms that are needed in FISA immediately . ''\nGreer encourages anyone concerned about government surveillance of what citizens are searching for on the web to call Nancy Pelosi 's office and pressure her to put a version of the Wyden-Daines Amendment , one of which is currently being drafted by Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D\u2013Calif . ) and Rep. Warren Davidson ( R\u2013Ohio ) , back in the bill .\n`` It 's really important that we remind lawmakers that the public does care about our right to be free from overly broad and intrusive surveillance , '' says Greer .\nMusic : `` Europa '' by Yehezkel Raz licensed from Artlist ; `` Ganymede '' by Yehezkel Raz licensed from Artlist ; `` Hang Drum Traveler '' by Max H. licensed from Artlist ; `` The End '' by Max H. licensed from Artlist", "Story highlights Eric Holder says Edward Snowden acted illegally , but that he did a public service\nThe former Attorney General also said there is a `` race-based '' component to Trump 's campaign\nThe Axe Files , featuring David Axelrod , is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics .

''", "The Supreme Court \u2019 s new move toward a definitive ruling on same-sex marriage could cement President Barack Obama \u2019 s claim to having presided over the most significant advances in gay rights in United States history .\nObama \u2019 s term has already seen the enactment of a federal law protecting gays and lesbians against hate crimes , an end to the ban on openly gay members of the U.S military and the issuance of a Supreme Court ruling striking down the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage . Such unions have now spread to 36 states across the country . A new Supreme Court ruling declaring same-sex marriage rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution could serve as the capstone on a record of change unparalleled on any other issue in the public eye during his tenure .\nBut precisely how much credit Obama deserves for the tectonic shift on the issue during his presidency is less clear-cut .\nMany gay rights activists and historians see Obama as having been reluctant to put much muscle into gay rights causes early in his White House stay , but then warming to the topic as a result of outside pressure and a realization that rapidly changing public opinion made such moves politically advantageous . Some advocates say he \u2019 s added crucial momentum to the drive for \u201c marriage equality \u201d in recent years , while others say he \u2019 s still cautious on the subject and more inclined to be swept along by the public debate than to lead it .\nThat gay rights , and in particular same-sex marriage , could wind up as a hulking component of Obama \u2019 s legacy is a surprising development for a president who publicly snubbed same-sex marriage until nearly 3 1/2 years into his presidency and faced repeated complaints that he was shortchanging gay issues .\n\u201c He was late to the party , but he certainly made up for it , \u201d said Richard Socarides , a New York lawyer and longtime gay rights advocate . \u201c This is shaping up to be [ Obama \u2019 s ] most significant policy achievement of his entire presidency . He has certainly participated and , in some large measure I think , pushed forward the most significant gains in gay rights that we \u2019 ve seen in the history of the country .\n\u201c He \u2019 s done so sometimes begrudgingly , but I think that is the nature of the presidency , \u201d the activist and former Clinton White House adviser said , noting the competing demands on a president \u2019 s attention .\nObama and his aides \u201c were against it until they were for it , and then they really owned the issue and championed it in a way that was jaw-droppingly historic , and that \u2019 s what they \u2019 ll be remembered for , \u201d said the Human Rights Campaign \u2019 s Fred Sainz .\nSome historians , however , give Obama less credit and question how much the issue deserves to be seen as part of his legacy . They conclude that Obama has eased the country \u2019 s moves toward greater recognition of gay rights but hasn \u2019 t been at the forefront of them .\n\u201c The question is : Is he a leader or a follower ? \u201d asked Andrea Friedman , a history professor at Washington University in St. Louis .\n\u201c Obama has been carried along by public opinion and shifts in public opinion that have just accelerated so rapidly , \u201d she said in answer to her own question . \u201c I don \u2019 t see him necessarily as a leader or this as part of his legacy . \u201d\nWhen Obama marked gay pride month last year , he boasted about his record but was careful to temper the remark with an acknowledgement that the White House had often been nudged along on the issue .\n\u201c Because of your help , we \u2019 ve gone further in protecting the rights of lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender Americans than any administration in history , \u201d the president said .\nThe Supreme Court potentially extended that trend Friday when it announced that it has agreed to take up a set of cases that raise the issue of whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to enter into same-sex marriages and whether states are obliged to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states .\nThe outcome of the case is far from guaranteed , but many legal analysts believe the court \u2019 s liberal justices are likely to join with Republican appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy in a ruling that makes same-sex marriage available nationwide .\nEarly on , the president showed more timidity in his approach on gay rights . The administration \u2019 s strategy on the military \u2019 s \u201c don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell \u201d policy , for instance , involved prolonged consultations with the Pentagon . As a result , the project lingered until Democrats lost seats in the Senate and Obama \u2019 s overall policy agenda bogged down .\nLegislation to repeal the \u201c don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell \u201d policy passed during Congress \u2019 s lame-duck session at the end of 2010 , and the president claimed the bill as a triumph , but many activists quietly said the administration \u2019 s strategy was flawed and the measure only nosed over the finish line due to a last-minute push by the likes of departing Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I-Conn. ) .\nOnce the law passed , however , advocates generally gave Obama high marks for its implementation , as well as for his appointment of a historic number of gay and lesbian officials to senior posts and judgeships .\nGay rights activists also credit the administration for taking a bold move in 2011 to dismantle the Defense of Marriage Act , the federal law President Bill Clinton signed in 1996 barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages . Attorney General Eric Holder , acting with Obama \u2019 s concurrence , announced the administration would no longer defend the law in court because there was no plausible argument to support its constitutionality .\n\u201c That was as game-changing as anything , \u201d said former Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass . ) , the first openly gay member of Congress . \u201c Presidents always have to defend the constitutionality of legislation they dislike . For the president to take the position that DOMA was so blatantly unconstitutional and undesirable that he would take that unusual step [ to abandon the law ] , that was the biggest deal of anything he did , and he deserved an enormous amount of credit for it . \u201d\nThat decision drew howls of outrage from Republicans , but in a 5-4 ruling two years later , the Supreme Court struck the law down .\nGay rights activists welcomed Obama \u2019 s reversal on same-sex marriage in 2012 , but he continued until last year to hold a nuanced stance on the legalities of the issue \u2014 arguably undercutting some advocates \u2019 efforts to have the courts sanction same-sex marriage throughout the country .\nIn part to fend off Republican calls for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage , Obama for years declared that marriage has traditionally been a state issue . Even when Obama \u2019 s evolution on gay marriage reached its apogee in 2012 , he spoke of state-by-state experimentation on the issue as welcome .\n\u201c What you \u2019 re seeing is , I think , states working through this issue \u2014 in fits and starts , all across the country , \u201d Obama told ABC \u2019 s Robin Roberts in an interview designed to showcase his change of heart on the subject . \u201c Different communities are arriving at different conclusions , at different times . And I think that \u2019 s a healthy process and a healthy debate . And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level , because historically , this has not been a federal issue , what \u2019 s recognized as a marriage . \u201d\nIn that interview , Obama also declined to quibble with North Carolina voters who had just agreed to insert a new ban on gay marriage in their state \u2019 s constitution .\nObama \u2019 s stance has long struck some advocates as misguided , since federal court cases striking down state bans on interracial marriage are at the core of civil rights jurisprudence and Obama once taught that subject at the University of Chicago . The approach also seemed to evoke a thread of the history of \u201c states \u2019 rights \u201d resistance to federal anti-discrimination laws \u2014 an odd resonance for America \u2019 s first African-American president .\nWhen litigation challenging California \u2019 s voter-approved same-sex marriage ban reached the Supreme Court in 2013 , the Justice Department did not announce unequivocal support for a federal constitutional right to what advocates call marriage equality . Instead , Obama administration lawyers took the highly nuanced position that California could not deny same-sex couples the right to marry because the state already accorded such couples all the other privileges that go along with marriage .\nSome analysts said the brief reflected a lack of courage on the administration \u2019 s part . Others said it was a strategic move aimed at making sure the court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act \u2014 a decision most easily reached by deferring to states .\n\u201c As a Republican looking at a Democratic president , President Obama \u2019 s equivocation on gay equality issues has always been really puzzling , \u201d said Gregory Angelo of the Log Cabin Republicans , a gay GOP group that backs same-sex marriage rights .\nWhen the Supreme Court announced Friday that it plans to wade into the issue of a federal right to same-sex marriage , the White House remained silent . In fact , on the eve of the announcement , White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to state the president \u2019 s views on the legal issues , though the spokesman said the president would welcome wider availability of same-sex marriage .\nHolder was more direct , announcing that the administration will urge the court to make same-sex marriage rights the law of the land .\n\u201c We expect to file a \u2018 friend of the court \u2019 brief in these cases that will urge the Supreme Court to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans , \u201d the attorney general said in a statement Friday . \u201c It is time for our nation to take another critical step forward to ensure the fundamental equality of all Americans \u2014 no matter who they are , where they come from , or whom they love . \u201d\nGay rights advocates say politics explain much of Obama \u2019 s reorientation from diffidence to active embrace of their positions . As public sentiment shifted on the issue , the administration saw opportunities to appeal to important constituencies by pushing an issue that differentiated Obama from most Republican candidates .\nProminent blogger and former Obama critic John Aravosis said Friday that he believes the administration \u2019 s change of approach on the subject became evident during the Democratic National Convention in 2012 . Pushing gay rights there wasn \u2019 t just the right thing to do , or a move to satisfy gay activists , but projected tolerance in a way that appealed politically to female voters , young people and others .\n\u201c Since 2012 , they \u2019 ve been embracing it , \u201d Aravosis said , even describing the administration as \u201c grandstanding \u201d on the issue . \u201c On the left , people talk about ours as one of the only progressive issues where [ Obama ] has had great success . \u201d\n\u201c Once they understood that this was an issue that could work for them , they got fully behind it . That happened when he got reelected : They realized they could run on this , rather than run away from it , \u201d added Socarides .\n\u201c Part of being president means you get to take credit for things that happen on your watch , and [ Obama ] came around and he was there when we needed him , \u201d Socarides said , getting to the issue of whether Obama could claim the sweeping change on the issue as part of his legacy . \u201c He definitely played a big part . \u201d\nAngelo said Obama deserves credit for embracing same-sex marriage rights even if that move came \u201c later than it should have. \u201d However , the gay GOP leader argued that the issue has been one where most politicians lagged , not led , the public .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think any factor has been more important in influencing public opinion \u2014 and , I dare say , the opinions of the Supreme Court \u2014 than Joe and Jane American who happen to be gay and live down the street and are living their lives openly and honestly with their friends , neighbors and family members , \u201d Angelo said . \u201c It \u2019 s trickled up more than it \u2019 s trickled down . \u201d\nThe advances on gay rights under Obama are so dramatic that The New Republic declared last October that he had become , in essence , America \u2019 s first gay president \u2014 a label that echoes author Toni Morrison \u2019 s branding of President Bill Clinton in 1998 as America \u2019 s first black president .\nHowever , it \u2019 s also clear that Obama \u2019 s rejections of same-sex marriage continued to sting his own supporters and even close staffers all the way until his election to the White House . And even in 2004 \u2014 as he ran for the U.S. Senate at the age of 43 \u2014 he was unaware of the Stonewall Riots , a watershed 1969 event in the history of the fight for gay rights , according to \u201c Winning Marriage , \u201d a book by Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry .\nFrank said that dwelling on Obama \u2019 s self-described evolution on the issue misses a more basic fact : Without his nominees to the Supreme Court , the ruling expected in June wouldn \u2019 t even be conceivable .\n\u201c If he had not appointed [ Justices Sonia ] Sotomayor and [ Elena ] Kagan , and if John McCain had been president and had appointed two justices , there isn \u2019 t any room for doubt we would not have had the DOMA case and the issue wouldn \u2019 t be before them again , \u201d Frank said . \u201c None of this would \u2019 ve been on the boards right now . \u201d", "A matter of `` dignity '' is how Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy cast his majority opinion upholding the right to same-sex marriage . Though Friday 's decision invoked high constitutional principles , the case had its roots in a very human , very personal crisis . Our Cover Story is reported by Martha Teichner :\nA party broke out on the steps of the Supreme Court when its ruling affirming the right of same-sex couples to marry was announced . For the record , the case was called Obergefell v. Hodges .\nAnd in the middle of the noise and jubilation , Jim Obergefell got a phone call from President Obama :\n`` Your leadership on this has changed the country , '' Mr. Obama said .\n`` I really appreciate that , Mr. President , '' Obergefell said . `` It 's really been an honor for me to be involved in this fight , and to have been able to fight for my marriage and live up to my commitments to my husband . ''\nJim Obergefell and John Arthur had been together more than 20 years when they were married in July of 2013 . Arthur was dying of ALS , Lou Gehrig 's disease , so family and friends raised $ 13,000 to fly the couple by medical jet out of Ohio ( where gay marriage was prohibited ) to Maryland , where the ceremony was performed legally , aboard the plane , on the tarmac in Baltimore .\nAll Obergefell wanted was to be listed as `` husband '' on Arthur 's Ohio death certificate .\nAs he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 correspondent Jan Crawford , `` I promised John . It was one more promise I made to him that I would fight for him . I would fight for our marriage wherever that led . ''\nTheir sad love story , combined with cases from Michigan , Tennessee and Kentucky , led to Friday 's historic 5-4 ruling , and to Justice Anthony Kennedy 's words , in the majority opinion : `` They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law . The Constitution grants them that right . ''\n`` The thing about the same-sex marriage issue is , it was n't started by the big gay groups -- they hated this issue , '' said Andy Humm , a long-time gay activist and journalist in New York .\n`` The big gay groups thought it was a big loser , and they were right in the beginning . ''\nWhat changed so quickly ? Because , he said , same-sex marriage in a few states happened , `` and the sky did n't fall . The law changed , and what changed for people in their lives ? Well , they just saw happiness for gay couples . ''\nGloria and Linda Bailey-Davies were married on May 17 , 2004 , the first day same-sex marriage licenses were issued in Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage .\nSince then , how much the landscape has changed is remarkable , and how fast -- over the last two years especially , the number of states has accelerated , reaching 37 -- before the Supreme Court guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage nationwide .\nIn 1996 , fewer than 3 in 10 Americans ( 27 percent ) thought same-sex marriage should be legal . Now , nearly 6 in 10 ( 57 percent ) do .\n`` I do n't think most of us who have ever read the scripture would believe that there is a division over what marriage means , '' said former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee . `` It 's still one man , one woman , life partners , and the courts can no more suspend the law of marriage any more than it can suspend the law of gravity . ''\nLike Huckabee , every Republican presidential candidate has lined up against the Supreme Court ruling .\nChief Justice John Roberts argued in his dissent that the issue should have been left to states -- voted on , not decreed by the court . `` Just who do we think we are ? '' he wrote .\n`` We have to go , obviously , by what the courts say , but I certainly can disagree with them , and I do , '' said Alabama Governor Robert Bentley . He 's willing to comply with the ruling , but there is resistance ..\nWhen Michael Robinson and his partner , Earl Benjamin , tried to get a marriage license in New Orleans after the court ruled on Friday , they were told they would have to wait . Louisiana and Mississippi claimed `` legal technicalities . ''\n`` It 's disappointing that Louisiana will not be following the movement that is happening around the country today , '' said Robinson .\nAnd in Texas , Reverend Dave Welch of the Houston Area Pastor Council vowed disobedience . `` A law that violates the law of God is no law at all , '' he said . `` There is no question : it is by the thousands and tens of thousands and the hundreds of thousands that will not bend the knee and we will not kiss the ring . We will not bow to the god of political correctness that seems to be dominating much of our court system today . ''\nAndy Humm said in response , `` This is your homophobia . This is your fear . This is your hatred of gay people , and you got ta get over it . ''\nImmediately after the Supreme Court decision , 85-year-old Jack Evans and 82-year-old George Harris , partners for more than 50 years , were the first gays to tie the knot legally in Dallas . An estimated 390,000 same-sex couples had already beaten them to it in the United States , raising this question : A generation from now , will gay marriage be a non-issue ?", "The Robertson family released a statement late Thursday that raises doubts about the future of one of the most popular shows on cable television .\n\u201c We have had a successful working relationship with A & E but , as a family , we can not imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm , \u201d the Robertson family said in a prepared statement . \u201c We are in discussions with A & E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty . \u201d\nThe family said it has \u201c spent much time in prayer \u201d since learning A & E had suspended Phil Robertson , the patriarch of the Louisiana family , over comments he made about homosexuality .\nRobertson sparked a national debate on religion and tolerance in an interview with GQ magazine . The writer asked him what he considered to be sinful behavior .\n\u201c Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there . Bestiality , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men , \u201d Robertson said .\nThen he paraphrased Paul \u2019 s letter to the Corinthians : \u201c Don \u2019 t be deceived . Neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers -- they won \u2019 t inherit the kingdom of God . Don \u2019 t deceive yourself . It \u2019 s not right . \u201d\nThe family defended Robertson \u2019 s comments and stressed that they are a \u201c family rooted in our faith in God and our belief that the Bible is His word . \u201d\n\u201c While some of Phil \u2019 s unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse , his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible , \u201d the family said . \u201c Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments : \u2018 Love the Lord your God with all your heart \u2019 and \u2018 Love your neighbor as yourself. \u2019 Phil would never incite or encourage hate . \u201d\nThe family also criticized A & E for its actions , saying he was placed on hiatus \u201c for expressing his faith , which is his constitutionally protected right . \u201d\nRobertson \u2019 s comments drew immediate condemnation from gay rights groups who pressured the network to take action . On Wednesday , A & E announced Robertson was being removed from the show indefinitely .\n`` We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson 's comments in GQ , which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty , '' the network said in a statement .\n`` His personal views in no way reflect those of A & E Networks , who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community . The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely . ''\nA & E \u2019 s decision to pull Robertson from the show drew strong support from the gay and lesbian rights group GLAAD .\n\u201c What \u2019 s clear is that such hateful anti-gay comments are unacceptable to fans , viewers , and networks alike , \u201d said GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz . \u201c By taking quick action and removing Robertson from future filming , A & E has sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value . \u201d\nDuck Dynasty drew 11.8 million viewers in August for the debut of its fourth season - setting a record for a cable nonfiction series . Hundreds of thousands of outraged fans responded to the news of Robertson \u2019 s suspension by launching boycotts and petitions They accused the network of discriminating against Robertson because of his religious beliefs and violating his First Amendment rights .\n\u201c Free speech is an endangered species , \u201d wrote former Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin on her Facebook page . \u201c Those \u2018 intolerants \u2019 hatin \u2019 and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us . \u201d\nLouisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal also voiced support for his embattled constituents .\n\u201c The politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints , except those they disagree with , \u201d he said . \u201c It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh , and Phil Robertson gets suspended . ''\nTony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , told Fox News the suspension shows Hollywood wants to avoid reality .\n\u201c The reality is that the Robertson family are Bible-believing Christians who don \u2019 t cherry pick what the Bible teaches , \u201d he said .\nPerkins said the Duck Dynasty patriarch was targeted \u201c simply because he expressed his religious beliefs but there is a clear double standard that is being applied . \u201d\n\u201c It is time for all Americans to take a stand against the cultural elites who want to destroy the livelihood of people and remove God and His truth from every aspect of public life , \u201d he said .\nThe Liberty Institute , a legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases , condemned A & E \u2019 s actions and urged them to reconsider .\n\u201c In the spirit of American tolerance of religious diversity , A & E should reinstate Mr. Robertson and apologize for its religious bigotry , \u201d the statement read .", "UPDATE : A federal judge has ordered a defiant Kentucky clerk to jail after she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples .\nU.S. District Judge David Bunning told Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis she would be jailed until she complied with his order to issue the licenses . Davis said `` thank you '' before she was led out of the courtroom by a U.S. marshal . She was not in handcuffs .\nBunning also warned deputy clerks around the state that they could suffer the same fate should they refuse to issue marriage licenses to gay couples .\nDavis has refused to issue marriages licenses for two months since the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage . She argues that her Christian faith should exempt her from signing the licenses .\nI \u2019 m very steadfast in what I believe . I don \u2019 t leave my conscience and my Christian soul out in my vehicle and come in here and pretend to be something I \u2019 m not . It \u2019 s easy to talk the talk , but can you walk the walk ? \u2014 Kim Davis , clerk of Rowan County , Kentucky\nLiberty Counsel attorney Mat Staver , who is representing Davis , called the ruling \u201c outrageous . \u201d\n\u201c If this country has come to this point where a judge jails someone like Kim Davis for their religious convictions \u2013 then we have lost our religious liberty , \u201d Staver told me .\nHe said Davis will be fingerprinted and photographed \u201c just like a criminal . \u201d\n\u201c This can not be tolerated , \u201d he said . \u201c This is ultimately going to spark a huge debate around the country . This is not the kind of country \u2013 this is not the America that our founders envisioned . \u201d\nKim Davis could become the first Christian in America jailed as a result of the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve weighed the cost and I \u2019 m prepared to go to jail , I sure am , \u201d Mrs. Davis told me in an exclusive interview . \u201c This has never been a gay or lesbian issue for me . This is about upholding the word of God . \u201d\n\u201c This is a heaven or hell issue for me and for every other Christian that believes , \u201d she said . \u201c This is a fight worth fighting . \u201d\nDavis is the clerk of Rowan County , Ky. \u2013 a small patch of earth in the northeastern part of the state . She was elected last November \u2013 taking the place of her mother , who held the position for nearly 40 years .\nIt \u2019 s fair to say that issuing marriage licenses was something of a family business \u2013 until the day the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage .\nDavis is a devout Apostolic Christian , and she knew that should gay marriage become legal , she could not and would not sign her name on a same-sex marriage certificate .\n\u201c I would have to either make a decision to stand or I would have to buckle down and leave , \u201d she said , pondering her choices . \u201c And if I left , resigned or chose to retire , I would have no voice for God \u2019 s word .\nSo when that day came , she issued an edict : No more marriage licenses would be issued in Rowan County . It was a decision that would bring down the wrath of militant LGBT activists and their supporters .\n\u201c They told my husband they were going to burn us down while we slept in our home , \u201d she said . \u201c He \u2019 s been told that he would be beaten up and tied up and made to watch them rape me . I have been told that gays should kill me . \u201d\nLiberty Counsel , the public interest law firm that represents Davis , says forcing her to issue same-sex marriage licenses violates her religious beliefs . But the courts don \u2019 t seem interested in that argument .\nA federal judge ordered her to issue the licenses , an appeals court upheld that decision and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene . Should Davis continue to defy the law , she could be fined or sent to jail .\nNo matter what the court decides , Davis says she will not violate her religious beliefs \u2013 and she will not resign her post .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very steadfast in what I believe , \u201d she told me . \u201c I don \u2019 t leave my conscience and my Christian soul out in my vehicle and come in here and pretend to be something I \u2019 m not . It \u2019 s easy to talk the talk , but can you walk the walk ? \u201d\nThe mainstream media and the activists have been ruthless . They \u2019 ve portrayed her as a monster \u2013 a right-wing , homophobic hypocrite . She \u2019 s been smeared by tabloid-style reports on her checkered past . They \u2019 ve written extensively about her failed marriages .\nIt \u2019 s true , she \u2019 s been married four times . But what \u2019 s missing in the mainstream media coverage is the context . Her life was radically changed by Jesus Christ in 2011 , and since then she has become a different person .\n\u201c My God in heaven knows every crack , every crevice , every deep place in my heart , \u201d she said . \u201c And he knows the thoughts that are in my mind before I even think them . And he has given me such a beautiful and wonderful grace through all of this . \u201d\nShe once lived for the devil , but now she lives for God . She \u2019 s a sinner saved by grace .\n\u201c I had created such a pit of sin for myself with my very own hands , \u201d she told me .\nSo how does she handle the reporters and talking heads who call her a hypocrite ?\n\u201c All I can say to them is if they have a sordid past like what I had , they too can receive the cleansing and renewing , and they can start a fresh life and they can be different , \u201d she said . \u201c They don \u2019 t have to remain in their sin , there \u2019 s hope for tomorrow . \u201d\nDavis did not seek the national spotlight . She had no intention of becoming a spokeswoman for religious liberty , and she bristles at the idea that she is a hero of the faith .\n\u201c I \u2019 m just a vessel God has chosen for this time and this place , \u201d she said . \u201c I \u2019 m no different than any other Christian .

The Courier-Journal\nMOREHEAD , Ky. \u2014 Defying the Supreme Court , a county clerk says she was acting under `` God 's authority '' Tuesday while continuing to deny marriage licenses to gay couples , whose lawyers asked a federal judge to hold her in contempt of court .\nThe Supreme Court refused Monday to allow Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis \u2019 office to deny the licenses because of her religious beliefs . However , on Tuesday morning , she turned away at least four couples .\n`` To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God 's definition of marriage , with my name affixed to the certificate , would violate my conscience , '' Davis said in a statement on the website of her lawyers , Orlando-based Liberty Counsel . `` It is not a light issue for me . It is a Heaven or Hell decision . For me , it is a decision of obedience . ''\nDavid Moore and his partner , David Ermold , confronted Davis over the clerk 's counter for more than 5 minutes as crowd of supporters shouted for Davis to do her job .\n`` This is overwhelming . It feels ridiculous , '' Moore said after being refused . `` Who has to go through this to get married ? This is 2015 . This is America . This is what we pay taxes for \u2014 to be treated like this , to be discriminated against ? ''\nLater in the morning , lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union filed two motions in U.S. District Court to hold Davis in contempt of court and compel her to start issuing marriage licenses again to those who apply . They want her to be severely fined , not jailed .\n\u201c I feel like I \u2019 ve been humiliated on such a national level , I can \u2019 t even comprehend it. \u201d David Ermold , Morehead , Ky .\n`` The duty of public officials is to enforce the law , not place themselves above it , '' the ACLU 's legal director , Steven R. Shapiro , said in a statement . State law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses to all eligible applicants .\nAn hour later Davis and her deputy clerks were notified to appear at an 11 a.m . ET Thursday hearing at U.S. District Court in Ashland , Ky. , about an hour to the east . The county seat of Rowan County , Morehead , is about halfway between Lexington and Ashland and is home to 10,000-student Morehead State University ; the county itself has about 24,000 residents .\nKentucky Gov . Steve Beshear previously has told county clerks resistant to issuing same-sex marriage licenses to resign . Another couple has filed a misdemeanor official-misconduct complaint against Davis with Kentucky 's attorney general , and Jack Conway , now running as the Democratic nominee for governor in this conservative state , will decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor .\nAs an elected official , Davis can \u2019 t be fired , but federal Judge David Bunning , who previously ordered her to stop denying marriage licenses , can impose potentially heavy fines and jail time . She could be impeached but the state Legislature is not in session and many lawmakers support her position .\nThe Kentucky County Clerk 's Association has proposed legislation to remove the issuing of marriage licenses from county clerks ' duties , relegating it to the state . County clerks now record and keep various legal records , including vehicle , hunting , fishing and marriage licenses ; mortgages , deeds and liens ; and voter-registration forms .\nDavis won her $ 80,000-a-year office in November , running as a Democrat , and succeeded her mother who served as county clerk for 37 years , according to The Morehead News .\n`` She is basically telling Judge Bunning and the 6th Circuit and the Supreme Court that she does n't care what they say , '' said William Kash Stilz Jr. , a lawyer for one gay couple whom her office has turned away four times , including Tuesday .\n\u201c I 'm willing to face my consequences , and you all will face your consequences when it comes time for judgment . It 's plain and simple. \u201d Kim Davis , Rowan County ( Ky. ) clerk\nMat Staver , Liberty Counsel 's chairman , said the decision was Davis ' to continue denying marriage licenses .\n`` Every decision in this case has been her decision , '' he said . `` For her this is ... not a defiance-of-the-court issue . This is a conscience issue . ''\nMonday 's ruling from the Supreme Court , made without comment or apparent dissents , is an early indication that while some push-back against gay marriage on religious grounds may be upheld , the justices wo n't tolerate it from public officials . In one of the first tests of the court 's June 26 decision upholding the rights of gays and lesbians to marry , Davis had argued that her Apostolic Christian faith prevented her from recognizing such marriages .\nRather than deny only same-sex couples , which the high court had said would be unconstitutional , Davis chose to stop issuing marriage licenses altogether \u2014 and same-sex and opposite-sex couples sued her .\n\u201c I have no animosity toward anyone and harbor no ill will , '' she said in her statement . `` To me this has never been a gay or lesbian issue . It is about marriage and God \u2019 s Word . \u201d\nBut her detractors mock her moral stand , noting that Davis was married and divorced three times before marrying her fourth husband .\nDavis argued before the courts that her refusal to issue licenses was not a major burden for any couple because Kentucky has more than 130 other marriage-licensing locations in other county clerks ' offices and branches . But federal district and appeals court judges refused to grant her wish , forcing Davis to seek the Supreme Court 's intervention .\nAt one point Tuesday , Moore and Ermold said they were not leaving without a license , and Davis told them they would be in for a long day . Then she began walking back toward her office where she remained much of the day with the door and blinds closed .\nThat 's when Moore shouted for someone to call the police .\n`` You should be ashamed of yourself , '' he yelled . `` Everyone in this office should be ashamed of themselves . Is this what you want to remember ? Is this what you want to remember \u2014 that you stood up for this ? That you children have to look at you and realize that you are a bigot and that you discriminated against people ? ''\n`` I 'm willing to face my consequences , and you all will face your consequences when it comes time for judgment , '' she said . `` It 's plain and simple . ''\nErmold and Moore have been together for 17 years . Davis has rejected their attempts to apply for a marriage license four times , and they now are among those suing Davis .\n\u201c I feel sad . I feel devastated , \u201d Ermold said outside as he stood with protesters . \u201c I feel like I \u2019 ve been humiliated on such a national level , I can \u2019 t even comprehend it . \u201d\nMoore said he hopes to obtain a license before the end of 2015 although lawyers have told him that the case could drag on for years .\nJames Yates and Willliam Smith Jr. left the courthouse hand-in-hand after they also were refused a license for the fifth time in recent weeks . Yates appeared to be fighting back tears as he said the denial was too hard to talk about .\nTheir lawyer , Stilz , said they were jeered as they left the courthouse .\n`` James said he and Will had never seen such hatred , '' Stilz said .\nRandy Smith , a local evangelist and Davis supporter , said her convictions are from God and he doubts she will reverse her policy . He was one of dozens of people backing the clerk and singing hymns in a demonstration outside .\nSome of her supporters compared her Tuesday to the Biblical figures of Paul and Silas , imprisoned for their faith and rescued by God .\n\u201c It \u2019 s because of the love of Christ that Kim is not passing out marriage licenses , '' said one man in the crowd , Jack Templeman . `` She \u2019 s even going against a man and woman to show the love of Christ . ... It \u2019 s all about the love of God . I see signs that it is about hate , but it \u2019 s really not . It \u2019 s about love . \u201d\nThe high court 's ruling does n't end Davis ' challenge , still pending at the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 the same appellate court that previously allowed Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee to block same-sex marriage before Supreme Court justices overruled them . But it means that in the meantime , her office must issue marriage licenses .\n`` There is separation of church and state for a reason , '' said Jeanna Smith , who stood with Davis ' critics . `` My mother is a Sunday school teacher , and my mother even said Kim Davis needs to do her job or get out . \u201d\nChristian group holding pray outside Rowan County Courthouse pic.twitter.com/99U10i136n \u2014 Mike Wynn ( @ MikeWynn_KY ) September 1 , 2015", "Part 2 Of The Martin O'Malley Interview Listen \u00b7 5:59 5:59\nMartin O'Malley , former governor of Maryland , says he 'll decide by late May whether he 's running for president . Running would put him \u2014 even he seems to acknowledge \u2014 in an uphill battle against Hillary Clinton , currently the only Democrat who has declared .\nO'Malley is positioning himself to Clinton 's left , and even President Obama 's left .\nHe 's for a much higher minimum wage , and against a major trade deal \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership . In an interview with NPR 's Steve Inskeep , O'Malley also said he wants to increase Social Security benefits , even though some people would pay more taxes .\nSurveys put O'Malley far behind Clinton . But , he 's hoping his travels across the country can change that . Last month , he addressed a crowd in Iowa while standing on a chair . Last week , he gave a speech at Harvard . And this week , he 's in the early primary state of South Carolina .\n`` I 've been an executive and a progressive executive with a record of accomplishments , '' the former Baltimore mayor said of the difference between him and Clinton . `` I think contrasts will become apparent . ''\nI think what 's going on right now , Steve , is you have a competition between two theories of how our economy actually works and how we generate economic growth that lifts us all . The Republican Party is doubling down on this trickle-down theory that says thou shalt concentrate wealth at the very top of our society . Thou shalt remove regulation from wherever you find it , even on Wall Street . And thou shalt keep wages low for American workers so that we can be more competitive . We have a different theory . Our theory as Democrats and as the longer arc of our story as Americans is that we believe that a stronger middle class is actually the cause of economic growth . What ails our economy right now is 12 years of stagnant or declining wages , and we need to fix this .\nI mean , look , talk is cheap . And so there are two ways to go forward from here , and history shows this . One path is a sensible rebalancing that calls us back to our tried and true success story as the land of opportunity . The other is pitchforks .\nThere 's , history affords no other paths . We 're either going to sensibly rebalance and do the things that allow our middle class to grow , that expands opportunities and allows workers to earn more when they 're working harder . Or , we 're going to go down a very , very bad path .\nOn whether large corporations are able to deal with regulation better than small businesses\nOh , certainly . I mean , our tax code 's been turned into Swiss cheese . And certainly the concentrated wealth and accumulated power and the systematic deregulation of Wall Street has led to this situation where the economy is n't working for most of us . All of that is true . But it is not true that regulation holds poor people down or regulation keeps middle class from advancing . That 's kind of patently bulls- - - .\nYeah , I do oppose it . What 's wrong with it is first and foremost that we 're not allowed to read it before our representatives vote on it . What 's wrong with it is that right now what we should be doing are things that make our economy stronger here at home . And it 's my concern that the Trans-Pacific Partnership , this deal is a race to the bottom , a chasing of lower wages abroad , and I believe that that does nothing to help us build a stronger economy here at home .", "Top House Republicans are demanding are seeking an investigation into new reports that the Census Bureau manipulated surveys that showed a steep drop in the U.S. unemployment rate shortly before the 2012 presidential election , even as the bureau said a key suspect in the matter left the bureau more than two years ago .\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa , California Republican , sent an angry letter to the bureau this week demanding that it investigate a \u201c shocking \u201d report in the New York Post that field worker Julius Buckmon and other unnamed bureau employees faked figures that were used in the monthly unemployment report , resulting in a dramatic and puzzling plunge in the unemployment rate from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent just before last year \u2019 s presidential election .\nHowever , the bureau said that Mr. Buckmon left the agency in August 2011 , long before the election , apparently because of questionable procedures that he used in gathering data when he worked at the bureau \u2019 s Philadelphia field office . Since the bureau has more than 7,000 field representatives like Mr. Buckmon , it would be close to impossible for one employee to have a significant effect on the overall report , the Census Bureau said in a statement Tuesday .\n\u201c We have no reason to believe this isn \u2019 t an isolated incident , \u201d she said , adding that she could not discuss Mr. Buckmon \u2019 s specific reasons for leaving because of privacy laws . \u201c This was an employee who was willfully disobeying Census procedures and disobeying the law . \u201d\nThe spokesperson said that when the bureau discovers inappropriate activity , the matter is referred to the Department of Labor \u2019 s inspector general . The field representative would be subject to disciplinary action if the IG finds any wrongdoing , including termination , the publication Business Insider reported .\nAsked about the reports at his White House press briefing Tuesday , spokesman Jay Carney called the Post story \u201c obviously misleading. \u201d The original New York Post story , which set off Mr. Issa \u2019 s inquiry , cited what it called a \u201c knowledgeable source \u201d who claimed that the data manipulation \u201c escalated at the time President Obama was seeking reelection in 2012 and continues today . \u201d\nThe Post \u2019 s anonymous source said that an unusual and headline-grabbing jobs report in September 2012 , which came out just before the election when Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney appeared to be closing in on President Obama in a very close contest , was \u201c faked \u201d to produce the dramatic reported decline in the unemployment to under 8 percent for the first time since the recession .\nFormer General Electric chairman Jack Welch and many Republicans at the time questioned whether the numbers had been manipulated in light of the weak job growth reported by businesses in a separate survey by the department .\nThe Post story , which cited confidential documents dating from 2010 , said Mr. Buckmon and other census employees were pressured by their supervisors to fudge surveys to fill in data gaps when they did not get the 90 percent response rate sought by the Department of Labor in compiling its monthly household survey , from which it derives the unemployment rate .\nThe Post story triggered a letter to the bureau from Mr. Issa demanding information about Mr. Buckmon , including his e-mails , his list of supervisors and any material related to a government investigation of Mr. Buckmon \u2019 s actions after he left the agency . Mr. Issa asked for the requested information by Dec. 3 .\n\u201c Since the bureau relies on the American public for its data , it is important that the Census Bureau cooperate with all investigations into this matter , \u201d Mr. Issa wrote . \u201c Any erosion of trust by the Census Bureau would have an immediate impact on other important census surveys , such as the American Community Survey , or the planning and implementation of the 2020 decennial census . \u201d", "`` We do n't have a level playing field for our workers , '' President Donald Trump told a group of workers in Kenosha , Wisc. , on Tuesday . Truth is , if we were to ever level the playing field with countries like Mexico and China , the average American worker would be making $ 3 an hour and spending their pittance on third-world health care and decrepit housing . Please , do n't level the playing field .\nWhen few things are going your way in politics , though , it 's customary to return to rhetoric that made you successful . So , as Republicans have been unable to push forward on health care reform or tax reform\u2014or anything not named Neil Gorsuch , for that matter\u2014it is unsurprising that Trump would turn to protectionism as a way to bolster his political fortunes .\nOn Tuesday , the president traveled to a tool manufacturing company in Wisconsin and threw some nationalistic bromides at a blue-collar crowd ( none of which included the words `` I 'm afraid some of your jobs will be taken by robots in the future '' ) , and then signed an executive order ordering the White House to look into ways to curb guest worker visa programs and require government agencies to buy more goods and services from American companies .\nFor the past two years , over 200,000 foreigners applied for open positions each year . The U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services holds a lottery and gives out 85,000 H-1B visas to high-skilled foreign workers . It 's a program that 's most popular with the tech industry , due to a shortage of Americans trained in science and engineering . I suppose it 's a lot easier to stop talented immigrants from entering the country than to find ways to incentivize Americans to become math majors .\nOver the past couple of decades , a high number of immigrants ( which many H-1B visa holders become ) have been part of innovations and start-ups that have created jobs for American workers . Now , even if you do n't believe immigrants add economic value , how exactly is cutting down on high-tech visas going to help rehabilitate the economically depressed areas of the nation ?\nMoreover , it seems telling that many of those who are concerned about illegal immigration also seem intent on lowering numbers of legal and potentially high-achieving immigrants from entering the country . The underlying message is that there is a cultural problem , not merely an economic one . `` When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia , I think\u2026 '' White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said not long ago in a jumbled explanation of economic nationalism , `` a country is more than an economy . We 're a civic society . ''\nThe second part of the order cuts down on waivers and exemptions to President Herbert Hoover 's Buy American law . It instructs agencies to use American-made goods and services rather than saving taxpayer dollars or searching out the best deals they can . This is how we incentivize rent-seeking and cronyism . Until a couple of months ago , this is what Republicans used to call `` picking winners and losers . '' If you thought General Motors should n't be bailed out because it could n't compete in a global marketplace , why would you support a state-impelled `` Buy American . Hire American '' when it comes to steel , for example ?\nIn a political sense , the idea of `` Buy American . Hire American '' is much like fighting climate change : a comforting government-prescribed solution that people embrace in theory but rarely in practice . In the protectionist 's universe , everyone with a Samsung cellphone or a Toyota Camry ( both the best-selling brands in their categories ) would be a traitor to the American worker . In the real world , competition allows us to buy the best products at the cheapest prices\u2014and then buy more things with the money we save . The rules of economics do n't give us waivers for being American .\nHow damaging will Trump 's trade agenda be ? Who knows ? Despite the protestations of the left\u2014and their eight-year weakening of constitutional restrictions on executive power\u2014Trump 's power has always been curbed by the realities of the job . But protectionism is one area where he could find willing partners in both parties .\nProtectionism , after all , is where Trump is most comfortable and effective . It 's the issue that made him , the issue he is most coherent about and the issue with which he has shown the most ideological affinity . Because of its political potency , it has also seen converts , not only among blue-collar Americans but also one-time free-market conservatives .\n`` Buy American , '' an appealing and patriotic-sounding solution , is popular across ideological lines . The protectionist impulses of the progressive left\u2014the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing\u2014closely align with Trump once the cultural aspects are stripped away . In American politics , both parties seem to have warmed to the idea that we can regulate the country into economic growth . The biggest risk is that protectionist rhetoric will be normalized within the GOP , which means there will be two parties with significant factions embracing mercantilism . How long will it be before that kind of support manifests in truly destructive legislation ?", "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : For more , we \u2019 re joined by two guests . Here in New York , Catherine Ruetschlin is a policy analyst at Demos and author of the report , \u201c Fast Food Failure : How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy. \u201d And Terrance Wise joins us from KCPT , Kansas City Public Television . He \u2019 s worked for Burger King for nine years , plans to go on strike today as part of the international push by fast-food and retail workers to demand a living wage . He \u2019 s a member of the Stand Up Kansas City campaign . We last spoke with Terrance in August as the strikes were just beginning here in the U.S .\nWe welcome you both to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! Terrance , let \u2019 s go to you . You have worked at Burger King for nine years . How much do you make an hour , if you don \u2019 t mind me asking ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I \u2019 ve worked in fast food for 17 years and at Burger King for nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour at Burger King .\nAMY GOODMAN : I \u2019 m sorry , I didn \u2019 t catch what you said . Can you say that again ?\nTERRANCE WISE : I \u2019 m sorry . I \u2019 ve been working fast food for 17 years , and Burger King I \u2019 ve worked for the past nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour working there .\nAMY GOODMAN : And why are you going on strike today ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I \u2019 m going on strike for my family . I raise three little girls here in Kansas City , and I need their future not to look anything like the past . We \u2019 ve struggled with homelessness , paying basic utilities\u2014gas , rent , the lights . And that \u2019 s while working every day . The working poor is what we are .\nAMY GOODMAN : Are you concerned about retaliation if you go out today ? What has Burger King said ? Presumably , since this is being organized all over the country , Burger King and McDonald \u2019 s know that workers are going to be walking out .\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , me , I first spoke to you , Amy , in August . That was my first strike . And this is number four for me . So , we know that the federal laws provide us protection when we come together as workers and demand the corporations we work for to pay us a living wage and to give us the right to form a union . So with that knowledge of knowing that the federal government protects our rights to organize and go on strike , it \u2019 s a huge relief for fast-food workers .\nAMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how many hours a week do you work at Burger King ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , it \u2019 s\u2014I make $ 9.40 an hour , so it \u2019 s like 35 , 40 hours a week . It \u2019 s , after taxes , maybe $ 400 every two weeks . And that \u2019 s working double sometimes , going in in the morning and working at night , just not bringing in enough . And we know that these companies make billions in profit . They can afford to pay us better and do better by us and give us a voice on the job . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re demanding .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , Catherine Ruetschlin , you \u2019 ve been studying this , the issue of what these fast-food companies can afford . Your report , \u201c Fast Food Failure : How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy. \u201d What is the disparity between the CEO , say , of Burger King and the workers , or McDonald \u2019 s ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , you know , when I started the study , I didn \u2019 t know that fast food was going to be such an extreme outlier in terms of pay disparity . The study arose kind of in this context that Terrance and other workers like him have created , where there \u2019 s a growing awareness that inequality is undermining the economy at several levels . But when I dug into the data , what I found was that fast food is a catalyst , with inequality that outstrips all the sectors of the economy . The CEO of a fast-food company in 2012 earned 1,200 times what the typical worker earned that year .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Twelve hundred times . And that \u2019 s with a fairly generous assumption that workers in fast food are receiving benefits and work a full-time schedule , which in many cases , you know , isn \u2019 t true .\nAMY GOODMAN : How does that affect the industry and the economy as a whole ? You say it hurts it .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . You know , there \u2019 s a macro-level story that \u2019 s just become a part of the conversation with organizations like the IMF and the World Economic Forum in Davos , pointing to inequality as a threat at the macro level because it generates instability in the economy and undermines growth . But then , at the micro level , firms are starting to wake up to the fact that it undermines their bottom lines , as well . In March , McDonald \u2019 s filed with the SEC and listed income inequality as one of the primary risks facing their own returns over the coming years , not just because workers are striking , but because they \u2019 re having a hard time satisfying their customers because they \u2019 ve underinvested in the front-line services that really build the brand and provide revenues to the firm .\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you respond to the companies saying , \u201c All right , if they increase the workers \u2019 wages , but then consumers have to be willing to pay more for the burgers \u201d ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , firms have a lot of ways that they could pay for a raise . They don \u2019 t necessarily have to pass the cost on to customers . They could do that , but they could also use some of the ways that they \u2019 re redirecting their profits right now . Firms like McDonald \u2019 s spend billions of dollars a year buying back their own shares of company stock on the market in order to consolidate ownership and bump up earnings per share and meet these short-term benchmarks . But that \u2019 s really a short-term understanding of the interest of the firm , right ? If they had a longer-term perspective , they would see that rather than investing in their share price , if they were investing in their labor force , they would generate returns\u2014higher productivity , loyal workers with better knowledge of the company processes , you know , lower turnover rates , so lower costs associated with job search\u2014and it would actually receive benefits through that investment that would pay off in the long run .\nAMY GOODMAN : And the issue of how these companies are subsidized , government-subsidized ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . A study came out recently that shows that fast-food employers , like McDonald \u2019 s , Subway , you know , Yum ! Brands , which owns Taco Bell and KFC and Pizza Hut , Domino \u2019 s Pizza , these are some of the highest-ranking employers in terms of working poor . So , if you can\u2014if you look into who \u2019 s receiving healthcare benefits for their families and wage subsidies from the state agencies , from poverty alleviation programs , the highest-ranking firms are Wal-Mart and fast food . So , it \u2019 s the taxpayers who are actually paying the\u2014for the ability for these firms to maintain a labor force at all .\nAMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how does it feel to learn that the CEO makes something like 1,200 times more than what you make ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I know that workers like myself and my co-workers across the city , we go to work every day , and we \u2019 re the driving force behind his billions in profit he brings in . He \u2019 s buying new yachts and new boats and new cars , and I just want to put my kids through college . So , just to see the disparity that I \u2019 m making $ 9.50 an hour and he makes over $ 9,000 , and just to get that out to the public and that information to be known , it \u2019 s eye-opening . And it calls for change .\nAMY GOODMAN : And , Terrance , the action you \u2019 re going to engage in today in Kansas City , what exactly are you going to do ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , like I said earlier , this is my fourth time . And I \u2019 ll band together with the majority of the co-workers at my store and hundreds of workers from around the city , and we \u2019 ll go different parts of the city . We \u2019 ll do chants . We \u2019 ll hold signs . We \u2019 ll give speak-outs . We \u2019 ll try to enter some stores , like I heard them say on New York earlier . In New York City , they \u2019 ve been doing this , and we \u2019 ll be doing this here in Kansas City . It \u2019 s just to get the message out to the public and to our bosses in the companies , that we \u2019 re not afraid . We \u2019 re going to stand together in solidarity , and we demand better . We \u2019 re not asking for a minimum wage increase . It \u2019 s not a minimum wage drive . It \u2019 s for billion-dollar corporations that have the money to pay us better and give us the right to have a union in this industry .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , Terrance Wise , I want to thank you very much for being with us , Burger King worker on strike today , part of Stand Up Kansas City , speaking to us from Kansas City Public Television . And , Catherine Ruetschlin , one more thing , not only the issue of the pay ratio of worker to CEO , 1,200 to one , CEO of course being the 1,200 , but the fast-food CEOs earnings quadrupling .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . What we \u2019 ve seen is that at these firms that have benefited from economic growth , overall , the CEOs and top executives have been able to capture all of those gains . So , while the fast-food CEO pay grew by 470 percent since 2000 , worker earnings only grew by 0.3 percent . Now , that means that their earnings aren \u2019 t even keeping up with the basic cost of living , so they \u2019 re actually losing ground in terms of standard of living year after year .\nAMY GOODMAN : Catherine Ruetschlin , I \u2019 d like you to stay with us , because next up after break we \u2019 re going to talk about Wal-Mart . President Obama spoke at a Wal-Mart recently . Right afterwards , 1,800 warehouse workers in California settled a major wage theft lawsuit against Wal-Mart and one of its largest contractors . This is \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! We \u2019 ll be back in a moment .", "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:10 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\nAfter a yearlong assault on the Federal Reserve and its chairman , President Donald Trump has tapped two wildly different economists to the central bank \u2019 s board who seemingly have one important thing in common .\nThey \u2019 re both likely to support the president \u2019 s call for lower interest rates .\nOne , Christopher Waller , is largely a conventional choice . Drawn from within the Fed \u2019 s own ranks , he \u2019 s been consistent in his calls for a more dovish approach over the years . The other , Judy Shelton , has spent decades outside mainstream economics and recently appears to have completed a metamorphosis from proponent of returning to the gold standard -- a concept broadly espoused by those who feel monetary policy is too lax -- to an advocate of the need for more stimulus .\n\u201c It seems like both are going to be in favor of lower rates , and sooner rather than later , \u201d said Kathleen Bostjancic , an economist at Oxford Economics in New York . \u201c They are much more dovish , and obviously that \u2019 s what President Trump wants . \u201d\nWaller is director of research for St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard , who was the only dissenting vote in favor of a rate cut at the Fed \u2019 s meeting in June . Shelton , who has been an informal adviser to Trump , has publicly said the central bank should reduce rates .\nTrump , who announced his picks within minutes of each other on Twitter Tuesday , has recently struggled to find candidates for the Fed that are acceptable to senators who must confirm nominees . The president previously advanced four people for the two remaining open seats on the board of governors . None of them made it , raising questions about the White House vetting process for his picks .\n\u201c It was a great pleasure to meet with the president this afternoon , \u201d Shelton said in an email on Tuesday night . \u201c This president really gets it . His pro-growth economic agenda should not be undermined by wrongheaded \u2018 Phillips Curve \u2019 thinking that punishes productive economic growth and subverts continued gains while turning a blind eye to the currency impact of \u2018 additional stimulus measures \u2019 by other central banks . We have high employment and low inflation ; so much for the supposed trade-off . \u201d\nThe Phillips Curve holds that there \u2019 s an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation .\nThe lengthy Senate confirmation process means neither candidate is likely to join the board for months , perhaps not even until next year . Current Vice Chairman Richard Clarida \u2019 s nomination was announced April 18 , 2018 , and he wasn \u2019 t sworn in until Sept. 17 . Governor Michelle Bowman , nominated the same day as Clarida , didn \u2019 t take office until Nov. 26 .\nAs a high-ranking Fed staffer , Waller may have a better chance of passing muster with lawmakers than some of Trump \u2019 s previous contenders . As for Shelton , the Senate has already confirmed her in her current role as the U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development .\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in May , she said she was \u201c highly skeptical \u201d that the goals for the Fed set by Congress -- the pursuit of maximum employment , stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates -- were relevant .\nRead more : Fed Hopeful Shelton Questions Value of Bank \u2019 s Dual Mandate\nThe White House has conducted the search for Fed candidates as Trump has repeatedly blasted Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed \u2019 s interest rate increases . The president has told confidants that he believes he has the authority to replace Powell as Fed chairman , demoting him to the level of board governor , according to people familiar with the matter . But Trump said he doesn \u2019 t plan to do it . The president chose Powell as Chair , replacing Janet Yellen last year .\nTrump \u2019 s eagerness to get rid of Powell makes both of these nominees potential chairs-in-waiting , a factor that may also affect their confirmation process in the Senate . Powell has said he intends to serve his full four-year term and that \u201c the law is clear \u201d on that issue .\nEarlier this year , Trump advanced two supporters for the Fed board , Stephen Moore and Herman Cain , but both withdrew their names after they came under criticism .\nWaller , who declined to comment Tuesday on his nomination , is a Ph.D. economist who previously served as a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame before joining the St. Louis Fed in 2009 . His key research focus has been on monetary and macroeconomic theory and the political economy .\nWaller was approached by the White House last month about the job and met with Trump Tuesday , said Karen Branding , a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Fed .\nThe overture came after the White House talked to his boss , Bullard , about joining the Fed board of governors himself . But Bullard told reporters last month that he \u2019 s happy in his current position .\nThe two men are close and have co-authored monetary-policy papers . Waller shares , and helped to develop in 2016 , Bullard \u2019 s dovish view that policy is in a new regime in a world with low inflation and high savings -- where higher interest rates are not needed .\nRead more : St. Louis Fed \u2019 s Waller Joins Bullard in a Dovish Duo at the Fed\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t see any overheating in the economy coming , and so the question was , why are we raising rates , \u201d Waller recalled in a June interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We didn \u2019 t see any reason to raise rates just for the sake of raising rates . \u201d\nWaller also said that he doesn \u2019 t worry about pushing the unemployment rate too low and sparking higher prices . \u201c We don \u2019 t buy into the Phillips curve story that low unemployment causes inflation . Look at Japan , \u201d he said .\nShelton has a doctorate in business administration from the University of Utah with an emphasis on finance and international economics . She previously worked for the Sound Money Project , which was founded to promote awareness about monetary stability and financial privacy .\nIn her interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in May , Shelton questioned the use of the Fed \u2019 s basic interest-rate tool to adjust the price of money , and thereby guide an economy toward a sustainable level of growth .\n\u201c A Fed that is too eager to artificially put in an interest rate that isn \u2019 t close to what the market would be suggesting is not so good , \u201d she said at the time . \u201c I would try to be the voice saying , are you sure you know better than the markets ? \u201d\nShelton has also in the past argued for a return to a gold standard , fixing the value of the U.S. dollar to a weight of gold , a system the U.S. followed to varying degrees until 1976 . If appointed to the Fed , however , Shelton said she would not call for a return to the gold standard or for a sudden abandonment of other established policies .\nAfter raising interest rates last year in the face of criticism from Trump , Powell and fellow Fed colleagues are widely expected to cut rates at their next meeting at the end of this month .\n\u2014 With assistance by Steve Matthews , Christopher Condon , Craig Torres , Matthew Boesler , Kathleen Hays , Sarah McGregor , and Saleha Mohsin", "There won \u2019 t be renewed efforts to tackle debt drivers until next year at the earliest . | AP Photos D.C. 's attention-to-deficits disorder\nFatigued by a government shutdown and repeated failures to reach a grand bargain , leaders from both parties have moved on .\nPresident Barack Obama isn \u2019 t expected to spend much time on deficit reduction and entitlement reform during Tuesday \u2019 s State of the Union address , instead focusing on issues such as economic inequality and raising the minimum wage that will be the centerpiece of his 2014 agenda .\nRepublicans don \u2019 t want to divert attention from Obamacare and plan to demand changes in the health care law , not spending cuts , in exchange for a debt-limit increase next month . They dismiss grand bargain talks with Obama as fruitless .\nFor Obama , the shifting political landscape is a chance to move past an issue that some Democrats see as a political loser headed into the midterms \u2014 the president even complained to Senate Democrats this month that he doesn \u2019 t get enough credit for previous deficit cuts .\nRepublicans see an opportunity to redefine themselves as a party that has an agenda beyond budget cuts . They say they will now focus on \u201c kitchen-table \u201d issues like increasing take-home pay , creating new incentives for school vouchers and charter schools , and some form of immigration reform .\nNot that the $ 17 trillion debt is going away anytime soon . The debt as a share of the economy is projected to decline over the next few years , and the deficit has dropped at the fastest rate since World War II \u2014 a point that Obama repeats often these days . The brightened outlook will last only a few years before an aging population and rising health care costs force deficits to balloon over the next decade . But the temporary cease-fire in the budget wars and an improvement in the fiscal picture have diminished any lingering sense of urgency for Washington to act on a large-scale deal .\nThat means there won \u2019 t be renewed efforts to tackle the real drivers of the debt until next year at the earliest , but likely not until after the 2016 presidential election .\n\u201c Neither party wants to talk about it , \u201d said Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . \u201c This is the first time we have been staring into the political horizon and there is no action-forcing moment . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , whose ascension in 2011 was fueled by small-government conservative activists , has all but ruled out any further deficit reduction talks with Obama because they can \u2019 t move past a basic disagreement on taxes . They also insist Obama has shifted his demands too often .\nIn next month \u2019 s fight to raise the debt ceiling , Boehner is not expected to renew his demand to cut spending by an equal amount \u2014 a principle that pushed Obama into extended , unsuccessful talks with the speaker in 2011 . Instead , Republicans are zeroing in on Obamacare , and are likely to insist on some kind of fix in exchange for increasing the country \u2019 s borrowing authority .\nWhite House aides said Obama stands by his last offer to Boehner in December 2012 , which included Medicare cuts that infuriated Democrats . But the president believes he \u2019 s reached the end of the line with Republicans on this issue , aides said , and has reoriented his White House toward fighting income inequality .\n\u201c The president has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to compromise with Republicans to reduce the deficit , \u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said . \u201c In fact , the deficit has been cut in half since he took office five years ago . That improvement in our deficit picture means we have more room to put in place , in a fiscally responsible way , policies that will expand opportunity for all Americans . \u201d\nFor Democratic lawmakers , many of whom never bought into Obama \u2019 s focus on debt and deficit reduction , the move away from austerity couldn \u2019 t have come soon enough .\n\u201c It is amazing how it has faded as an issue except among a small group , \u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , the No . 3 leader . \u201c The reason is , first , we have made big progress and , second , it has become apparent that it is not on the average person \u2019 s mind . \u201d\nThe president gave the budget top billing in last year \u2019 s State of the Union address , turning to it immediately after detailing the general themes of the speech . The White House and Congress had agreed to $ 2.5 trillion in spending cuts and tax hikes over the past few years , he told lawmakers , putting them more than halfway toward the goal of $ 4 trillion to stabilize the country \u2019 s finances .\n\u201c Now we need to finish the job . And the question is , how ? \u201d Obama said as he renewed calls for tax and entitlement reform .\nAlthough he pushed for a repeal of across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester , they kicked in last March , locking in budget savings that allowed Obama to tout several months later that the deficit was on a rapid decline .\n\u201c It \u2019 s now dropped at the fastest rate in 60 years , \u201d Obama said at an August town hall in Birmingham , N.Y. , as he called for only \u201c some modifications \u201d to entitlement programs . \u201c I want to repeat that , because a lot of people think that \u2014 if you ask the average person what \u2019 s happening with the deficit , they \u2019 d tell you it \u2019 s going up . The deficit has been cut in half since 2009 and is on a downward trajectory . And it \u2019 s gone down faster than any time since World War II . \u201d", "President Trump waived shipping restrictions for Puerto Rico on Thursday at the request of the island 's governor and after an outcry from Congress about shortages of fuel , food and emergency supplies in the wake of Hurricane Maria .\nThe decision temporarily lifts the Jones Act 's restrictions prohibiting foreign-flagged vessels from picking up and delivering fuel between U.S. ports .\nA one-two punch by Hurricanes Irma and Maria battered the island in recent weeks , leaving residents with shortages of all supplies .

But Defense and Homeland Security officials said there were plenty of ships to supply Puerto Rico \u2014 the problem was moving supplies around the island because of roads blocked by trees and landslides .\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , has tried repeatedly to repeal the Jones Act , which he called archaic and burdensome . He and Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , proposed Thursday to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act , as the U.S. Virgin Islands are already exempt .\n`` It \u2019 s time for Congress to take action , end this injustice , and help our fellow citizens in this time of need , '' McCain said .\n\u201c The Jones Act is just another example of a federal regulation that harms American consumers , gives foreign corporations an edge over American businesses , and makes disaster response harder , '' Lee said . \u201c It is far past time to repeal it . \u201d\nBut Rep. John Garamendi , D-Calif. , said Puerto Rico \u2019 s problem is moving cargo from ports to gas stations , warehouses , supermarkets and relief agencies , rather than shipping cargo to the island . Of 6,000 containers filled with supplies already sitting at the island 's port terminals , only about 400 will be moving Thursday , he said .\n\u201c The log jam is the freight movement on the island , which is simply not going well , \u201d said Garamendi , who serves on the maritime transportation subcommittee . \u201c It \u2019 s picking up a little bit each day , but the problem is on the land side , not the water side . \u201d\nAbout two-thirds of Puerto Rico \u2019 s imports typically come from foreign vessels and international ports , including six of the seven petroleum tankers that arrived within the last week , Garamendi said .\nThe Jones Act is crucial to maintaining the U.S. maritime industry and protecting national security , rather than to allow foreign vessels to move between U.S. ports along inland waterways such as the Mississippi River , he said .\n\u201c It would be a major national-security issue to open those waterways in the heart of America to foreign vessels , foreign crews , which would be impossible to maintain any level of security , \u201d Garamendi said .\nTrump , who plans to visit the island next week , said Wednesday that he was studying the matter , but the U.S. shipping industry was opposed to waiving the law .\nSarah Sanders , Trump \u2019 s spokeswoman , tweeted Thursday the Jones Act would be waived .", "Irma pushes north and is causing problems in Charleston , S.C .\nHigh winds felled trees and severed service lines in Georgia and South Carolina on Monday , knocking out power for more than 900,000 electricity customers in the two states .\nA tropical storm warning was issued for all of Georgia \u2019 s Atlantic coast and most of the South Carolina coast . Some of the worst flooding occurred in Charleston , where knee-high floodwaters coursed through the streets \u2014 high enough for some residents to navigate by kayak .\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for Charleston County , and said that parts of the Charleston peninsula , which contains the city \u2019 s historic core , were being closed down .\nIn an interview Monday afternoon , Mayor John Tecklenburg said that the city had been hit with a four-foot storm surge , leaving parts of the peninsula looking as if they had merged with the Ashley River .\n\u201c It sounds kind of counterintuitive that we \u2019 d have that , because the center of the storm is over 200 miles away in western Georgia , and here we are over on the coast of South Carolina , \u201d he said . \u201c But just if you looked at the bigger weather map and saw the counterclockwise rotation of Irma , juxtaposed with a clockwise high-pressure rotation over the Atlantic , Charleston was like in the pincer of those two motions that has driven wind and hurricane bands almost directly into our city . \u201d\nMr. Tecklenburg said that the flooding was even worse than last year \u2019 s Hurricane Matthew , which inundated the city in October , in great part because Matthew arrived at low tide , whereas Irma \u2019 s effect came at high tide .\nFarther inland , concerns about serious damage remained high , even as the storm \u2019 s power diminished somewhat .\nIn Atlanta , the winds whipping through the leaves created a sound like an angry sea breaking on a shoreline , and trees crashed into residences and onto roadways .

Not a lot of flooding . Tree removal , debris \u2014 don \u2019 t want to say it \u2019 s negligible , but it \u2019 s manageable . \u201d\nThe city was again spared from a direct hit by a hurricane , as has been its good fortune for more than 90 years running .

The loudest side is supposed to win .\nHowever , the lawmaker who is presiding always declares \u201c in the opinion of the chair , the ayes have it \u201d or \u201c the noes have it. \u201d But , if the losing side doesn \u2019 t like the outcome , they can always demand a recorded vote . Finally , there is \u201c unanimous consent. \u201d That \u2019 s where all 435 or 100 people must agree . All it takes is a solitary objection , even if everyone else wants to do something else . Lodging an objection stops everything .\nLONE GOP REP BLOCKS DISASTER AID BILL IN SURPRISE MOVE\nIt is said you can make the sun rise in the west if you obtain unanimous consent .\nThere were only three House members on the floor Friday when the House tried to advance the disaster aid measure by unanimous consent and sync up with the Senate . Rep. Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , presided over the session . Rep. Donna Shalala , D-Fla. , was on the floor to make the unanimous consent request . And then there was Roy .\nThose in favor of the measure outnumbered Roy two one .\nUnanimous consent is powerful - but hard to obtain . There \u2019 s only one reason Roy showed up Friday morning as the House attempted to approve the measure with a skeleton staff on hand . Passing the package by unanimous consent would mean the House and Senate were in alignment , having okayed the same package . The measure would then be ready for President Trump \u2019 s signature .\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , implored Democratic leaders to keep the House in session on Thursday to approve the disaster aid measure . But the House wasn \u2019 t going to budge until the Senate acted . Most House members jetted out of Washington midday Thursday for a week-and-a-half , starting the Memorial Day recess .\nIt was unclear until early Thursday afternoon as to the fate of the disaster package . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , warned his colleagues the Senate would vote \u201c on something \u201d on disaster aid and \u201c not adjourn. \u201d The Senate pondered re-voting a sidetracked version of disaster aid which fell apart in early April . But the Senate was set to vote on a retooled plan once President Trump signaled he would sign the measure \u2013 even without the border provisions . Things came together very quickly in the Senate . But the House was long gone .\nOne may ask whether it would have been worthwhile to keep the House in session just to see if the Senate would act . Of course , there \u2019 s always grandstanding from lawmakers about such efforts . Lawmakers regularly trumpet why Congress should remain in session over a recess or a weekend to try to fix one issue or another . Those are often the same lawmakers who have a cab idling just outside the Capitol , ready to whisk them across the river to make a flight at Reagan National Airport .\nThe Memorial Day recess is particularly problematic for scheduling . Many members have big overseas work trips planned . A number of lawmakers are expected to go to Normandy , France in a few days for the 75th anniversary of D-Day . That \u2019 s to say nothing of lawmakers who are jetting back to their states and districts to participate in Memorial Day parades and visit cemeteries .\nTethering lawmakers to Washington for a day or two , without a clear idea that a consequential vote is coming presents a problem . Yes , the Senate approved the disaster bill just after the House abandoned Washington . But it was far from clear that senators would do that Thursday .\nRoy chatted briefly with Shalala on the House floor just before the session started Friday morning .\n\u201c He came up to graciously inform me he was going to object because he wanted the President \u2019 s border request to be included , \u201d said Shalala . \u201c This is not the way our government should work . We \u2019 re ready to work in the House in a bipartisan way . The same as the Senate was ready to go . One individual . His position is irresponsible . \u201d\nShalala characterized the turn of events as \u201c tragic. \u201d She worried about the additional delay for families trying to recover .\n\u201c Why should they have to wait a week longer because some member of Congress objects ? \u201d asked the Florida Democrat .\nOf course , the question is whether Roy simply delayed the inevitable . But the House won \u2019 t return to full action until June 4 . The House appears to have the votes to pass the plan in bipartisan fashion .\n\u201c This , is respectfully , swamp-speak . Delaying the inevitable . It \u2019 s the inevitability of DC . The inevitability of spending where we don \u2019 t speak up and voice the concerns that I hear when I go back to every town in Texas 21 , \u201d said Roy . \u201c Why aren \u2019 t we addressing disaster spending in a way that is fiscally responsible ? We just keep writing checks . \u201d\nRoy got an earful from Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried .\n\u201c It \u2019 s craven , shameful politics at its worst that a single House member would choose to further delay disaster relief , \u201d protested Fried . \u201c Congressman Roy must have forgotten the aid that Texans received after hurricane Harvey . \u201d\nIt is said that house guests and fish start to smell after three days . Consider the controversy which stymied this disaster package . Republicans tried to infuse the bill with presidential politics . They argued Senate Democrats running for President should vote yes \u2013 or face trouble in sodden Iowa ahead of the caucuses . Republicans contended Democrats played politics with Puerto Rico money . There were questions about what a stunted disaster bill would mean for Sens . Joni Ernst , R-Iowa , Ben Sasse , R-Neb. , John Cornyn , R-Texas , and Perdue . All face re-election bids in states desperate for disaster assistance . All could face competitive races . Ernst is in a battleground state . Texas and Georgia are trending slightly toward Democrats . Then there were issues about adding humanitarian provisions for the border . Are things settled with this legislation ? Or , will another impediment possibly expose the bill to political enzymes , ready to foul the legislation ?\n\u201c I am not looking for a way to erode support for something , \u201d said Roy when asked about letting the legislation bake in the parliamentary elements for more than a week . \u201c This legislation should be offset . This legislation should include border funding so we can deal with that crisis . \u201d\nBut the bill may not have to wait a week .\nOnly a few House members will linger around Washington for the next 11 days . The House is scheduled to meet briefly at 2 pm on Tuesday , May 28 and at 4:30 pm on Thursday , May 30 . House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , intimated that \u201c we will take action as early as next week when the House meets again during pro forma . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a reference to those short sessions . The House could again attempt to marshal unanimous consent to pass the disaster aid bill without a roll call vote . This is a ploy by Democrats to dare Roy or other Republicans to object again . Then Democrats can portray them as obstructionists who are trying to delay disaster assistance .\nThis could all backfire on Roy and other GOPers . If they don \u2019 t object , then the bill passes and the protestations fall by the wayside . If they do block the bill a second or a third time , then Democrats can easily make the case about Republican obstructionism .\nNot a lot of people knew who Chip Roy was before today . But now they do . Democrats will pin a name and a face on the obstruction .\nThen again , one senior Republican source told Fox \u201c perhaps Roy wants it that way . \u201d", "Two years ago , almost no British people had heard of it , but this year Black Friday has become the latest American craze to cross the pond . At shops up and down the country punters fought to get their hands on discounters toasters and TVs .\nAmazon was the first UK-based retailer to discount goods on the day after the American Thanksgiving holiday three years ago . Last year they were followed by ASDA , which is owned by the US retail giant Walmart .\nSo far there have been at least four arrests , as discounts whipped shoppers into a frenzy . The main disturbances were in South London and Manchester , where shoppers queued for hours before shops opened . When they did open the British abandoned their traditional love of politeness and queuing to join in what was much more akin to London \u2019 s new NFL team .\nBy the time tills close tonight shoppers are expected to have spent \u00a3200m , a welcome boost for struggling retailers . The major chains joining in this year include the UK \u2019 s largest retailer TESCO and New Look which operates 1,100 branches . The major chains have offered seemingly unbelievable deals , with prices being halved on many products .\nIn advance of Black Friday Ayaz Alam , Senior Directorof Asda , said : \u201c Last year we were the first major retailer to bring Black Friday to the UK . This year , we \u2019 ve stepped it up a gear again and by working closely with Walmart \u2013 the godfather of Black Friday \u2013 we \u2019 ll be bringing an even bigger and better sale to the UK than ever before . \u201d\nDespite the excitement of the retailers and shoppers , some experts sounded a note of caution over the stunt . Retail expert Dan Wagner from Powa Technologies told Sky News that the day could trigger a \u201c battle to reduce prices more and more \u201d until some retailers bankrupt themselves .\nThe Metropolitan Police have also appealed for calm after they were asked to restore order in a number of participating stores today .", "The government is to add a new clause to the Brexit bill to rule out any extension to the transition period beyond the end of next year .\nThe post-Brexit transition period - due to conclude in December 2020 - can currently be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years .\nBut an amended Withdrawal Agreement Bill the Commons is set to vote on this week would rule out any extension .\nThe PM told MPs it would put an end to years of `` deadlock , dither and delay '' .\nAs the House of Commons assembled for the first time since the election , Boris Johnson said his priority was to `` get Brexit done '' . He also promised to seek `` common ground '' and to approach politics with a `` new and generous spirit '' after the rancour of recent years .\nJeremy Corbyn congratulated the Conservative leader on his victory but said he would be `` judged '' on whether he delivered on the `` many , many promises '' he had made during the campaign , including to longstanding Labour voters .\nThe UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January , more than three and a half years after the public backed Brexit in a referendum .\nSoon after , the two sides will begin talking about their future economic relationship , including controversial areas such as fishing rights , consumer and environmental standards and financial services .\nTrade deals typically take many years to conclude and senior EU figures are sceptical that a deal can be agreed within that time . If it is not , the economic relationship will default to World Trade Organization ( WTO ) terms , with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports .\nThe EU 's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would `` do the maximum '' to finalise the deal in time . Asked about the UK 's refusal to contemplate any extra time for the talks , he said `` it is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants '' .\nThis is a political signal , a moment of early chest beating too , designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months .\nAnd designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely `` done '' as soon as possible .\nBoris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast , there has to be a convincing clear deadline .\nIt was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place , and although it was broken in the end , there 's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done .\nPutting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels . How effective that might be ? That 's a different question .\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM 's move was `` reckless and irresponsible '' and he argued that Mr Johnson was `` prepared to put people 's jobs at risk '' .\nLiberal Democrat interim leader Sir Ed Davey said : `` The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU . ''\nDowning Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday .\nWith a majority of 80 following Thursday 's general election , Mr Johnson is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to end its EU membership on 31 January .\nSo , the government is going to pass a law to stop itself doing something that it had already promised not to do .\nBecause the decision on whether to extend the transition period lies with the prime minister anyway , not with Parliament .\nAnd with his new majority , Mr Johnson knows his critics ca n't do anything to force his hand .\nBut as a statement of intent , this announcement is important .\nBy reaffirming Mr Johnson 's guarantee that the transition period will not be extended , it suggests there will only be enough time to agree a pretty basic trade deal which would leave many important issues unresolved .\nThat means a quick 'zero tariffs zero quotas ' deal on goods could be done , as long as the UK is prepared to sign up to the EU 's main conditions .\nThey include the UK sticking with EU rules on environmental and social policy , and on state aid for companies .\nSuch an agreement would n't get rid of all border checks , though , and it would n't do anything for the services sector .\nThe PM could of course change his mind again - he 's done that before .\nBut this is also a warning for businesses - they could be in for a bit of a bumpy ride at the end of next year .\nAs well as ruling out an extension , the Independent reports that the amended withdrawal agreement may omit previous `` provisions to ensure that workers ' rights were not weakened after Brexit '' .\nCabinet minister Michael Gove said workers ' rights would be `` safeguarded '' in separate legislation , adding that the government wanted to make sure the Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes through Parliament `` cleanly and clearly '' .\nBut shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government would `` sacrifice our basic rights and certainty for business at the altar of turning the UK into a Trump-supporting tax haven '' .\nAnd Labour 's Barry Gardiner said his party would be less likely to support the bill if clauses on workers ' rights and the environment were removed .\nThe prime minister promised during the general election campaign that he would not seek an extension to the transition period - persuading Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to stand down candidates in Tory seats .\nSam Lowe , from the Centre for European Reform think tank , told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that a December 2020 deadline could help the PM manage his own party when it comes to making concessions to the EU .\n`` The prospect of a no-deal is still there , '' Mr Lowe said . `` The question is whether Boris Johnson wants a no-deal but the evidence of recent time suggests no he does n't . ''\nMeanwhile , in the first act of the new Parliament , MPs re-confirmed Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in his post without any opposition .\nThe MP for Chorley , who was only succeeded John Bercow at the start of November , said it was the `` greatest privilege '' to be asked to take the chair again and he would do his utmost to `` cherish the best traditions '' of the Parliament .\nCommons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday .\nAfter the election of the Speaker , the process of swearing in MPs begins . They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown , or , if they object to this , a solemn affirmation . Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat `` as if they were dead '' under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866 .\nTwo to three days are usually set aside for this process .\nThe state opening of Parliament . The Queen 's Speech is the centrepiece of this , when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government 's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session . A couple of hours after the speech is delivered , MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days .\nDepending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move , the debate on the Queen 's Speech could continue into Friday .\nThe government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament .\nMPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson 's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October .\nAfter the debate on the Queen 's Speech is concluded , MPs will vote on whether to approve it . Not since 1924 has a government 's Queen Speech been defeated .", "The shadow foreign secretary , Emily Thornberry , has said a Labour government would engage in a businesslike way with Donald Trump but would not afford special honours to the US president .\nSpeaking before a mass demonstration in London on Tuesday , which will be addressed by the Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn , Thornberry said : \u201c A state visit is an honour and we don \u2019 t think this president deserves an honour .\n\u201c The truth is he has tried to close borders with Muslim-majority countries , he is caging small Mexican children , he has grabbed women and boasted about it . He is a sexual predator , he is a racist and it \u2019 s right to say that \u2013 we need to think about when is it our country got so scared ? \u201d she told BBC Radio 4 \u2019 s Today programme .\nThornberry said Corbyn \u2019 s attendance at a state banquet for the Chinese president , Xi Jinping , was a different situation .\n\u201c When you have a close friend and they \u2019 re going wrong , you are more likely to be adamant with them and clearer with them than someone who has not been as close a friend and someone you are trying to build a relationship up with , \u201d she said .\nThornberry , speaking earlier on ITV \u2019 s Good Morning Britain , said Labour would not refuse to engage with Trump , but would do so without pomp and ceremony .\n\u201c When I become foreign secretary , I hope that what he will respect and understand is a certain amount of strength and an ability to be able to say what it is that you think , and not be bullied and kowtowed and shouted over . And say Britain is a friend of a America , you are going wrong , \u201d she said .\nThe shadow foreign secretary called the government \u2019 s attitude \u201c pusillanimous , it \u2019 s too weak , it doesn \u2019 t stand up to him \u201d , and said the president \u201c undermines the world order \u201d in a hugely risky way .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll talk to him but not in front of the Queen . We \u2019 d have a business meeting , \u201d she said .\nThornberry said she had written to Buckingham Palace to pre-emptively decline an invitation to the state dinner hosted by the Queen at the palace on Monday night , which Corbyn also declined to attend .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t want to embarrass the palace by them sending an invitation and me saying no . So I wrote and pre-empted it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The Queen invited the president over on the advice of the prime minister . That advice was wrong . I \u2019 m not saying that he should not come and have business meetings , I \u2019 m not saying we shouldn \u2019 t talk to him , but the things I want to say to President Trump I probably shouldn \u2019 t say in front of Her Majesty . We would end up having an argument . \u201d\nA huge police and security operation was under way on Tuesday morning , with protesters barred from demonstrating directly outside Downing Street and road closures in place .\nOrganisers of the Together Against Trump protest have billed the day as a \u201c carnival of resistance \u201d , with demonstrators gathering at Trafalgar Square from 11am to declare a \u201c Trump-free zone \u201d .\nDemonstrators will not be permitted to march past Downing Street , as part of Whitehall will be closed off , the Metropolitan police confirmed on Monday afternoon . Organisers had initially planned to demonstrate outside the entrance to Downing Street as Trump held talks at No 10 .\nTheresa May , who is hosting the US president as one of the final acts of her premiership , will not hold a one-on-one bilateral meeting with him , but will host Trump in Downing Street on Tuesday for a series of events , including a press conference later in the afternoon .\nShe will insist the relationship between the US and the UK is \u201c a great partnership , but one I believe we can make greater still \u201d .\nThe two leaders will jointly host a business breakfast with US and UK companies , highlighting the claimed benefits of a post-Brexit bilateral free-trade deal .

''\nLady Hale said the unanimous decision of the 11 justices meant Parliament had effectively not been prorogued - the decision was null and of no effect .\nSpeaker of the Commons John Bercow said MPs needed to return `` in light of the explicit judgement '' , and he had `` instructed the House of Commons authorities to prepare ... for the resumption of business '' from 11:30 BST on Wednesday .\nHe said prime minister 's questions would not go ahead , but there would be `` full scope '' for urgent questions , ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates .\nShort of the inscrutable Lady Hale , with the giant diamond spider on her lapel , declaring Boris Johnson to be Pinocchio , this judgement is just about as bad for the government as it gets .\nMr Johnson is , as is abundantly clear , prepared to run a general election campaign that pits Parliament against the people . And so what , according to that view of the world , if that includes the judges as part of the establishment standing in his way ?\nBut there is a difference between being ruthless and reckless .\nAnd the scope and strength of this judgement can not just be dismissed as some pesky judges sticking their noses in .\nReacting to the ruling , Mr Johnson said it was an `` unusual judgement '' , adding : `` The prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge .\n`` There are a lot of people who basically want to stop this country from coming out of the EU and we have a Parliament that is unable to be prorogued and does n't want to have an election . I think it is time we took things forward .

The government will be held to account for what it has done . Boris Johnson has been found to have misled the country . This unelected prime minister should now resign . ''\nLawyers for the government had argued the decision to prorogue was one for Parliament , not the courts .\nBut the justices disagreed , unanimously deciding it was `` justiciable '' , and there was `` no doubt that the courts have jurisdiction to decide upon the existence and limits of a prerogative power '' .\nThe court also criticised the length of the suspension , with Lady Hale saying it was `` impossible for us to conclude , on the evidence which has been put before us , that there was any reason - let alone a good reason - to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks '' .\nA spokesperson from the Attorney General 's office said the government had acted in `` good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional '' .\n`` These are complex matters on which senior and distinguished lawyers have disagreed , '' a statement said .\n`` The Divisional Court led by the Lord Chief Justice agreed unanimously with the government 's legal position , as did the Outer House in Scotland .\n`` We are disappointed that in the end the Supreme Court took a different view . We respect the judgment of the Supreme Court . ''\nIt is worth just taking a breath and considering that a prime minister of the United Kingdom has been found by the highest court in the land to have acted unlawfully in shutting down the sovereign body in our constitution , Parliament , at a time of national crisis .\nThe court may have fallen short of saying Boris Johnson had an improper motive of stymieing or frustrating parliamentary scrutiny , but the damage is done , he has been found to have acted unlawfully and stopped Parliament from doing its job without any legal justification .\nAnd the court has quashed both his advice to the Queen and the Order in Council which officially suspended parliament .\nThat means Parliament was never prorogued and so we assume that MPs are free to re-enter the Commons .\nThis is the most dramatic example yet of independent judges , through the mechanism of judicial review , stopping the government in its tracks because what it has done is unlawful .\nBe you ever so mighty , the law is above you - even if you are the prime minister .\nUnprecedented , extraordinary , ground breaking - it is difficult to overestimate the constitutional and political significance of today 's ruling .\nThe ruling was made after a three-day hearing at the Supreme Court last week which dealt with two appeals - one from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller , the second from the government .\nMrs Miller was appealing against the English High Court 's decision that the prorogation was `` purely political '' and not a matter for the courts .\nThe government was appealing against the ruling by Scotland 's Court of Session that the prorogation was `` unlawful '' and had been used to `` stymie '' Parliament .\nThe court ruled in favour of Mrs Miller 's appeal and against the government 's .\nSpeaking outside the court , Mrs Miller said the ruling `` speaks volumes '' .\n`` This prime minister must open the doors of Parliament tomorrow . MPs must get back and be brave and bold in holding this unscrupulous government to account , '' she added .\nThe SNP 's Joanna Cherry , who led the Scottish case , called for Mr Johnson to resign as a result of the ruling .\n`` The highest court in the United Kingdom has unanimously found that his advice to prorogue this Parliament , his advice given to Her Majesty the Queen , was unlawful , '' she said .\n`` His position is untenable and he should have the guts , for once , to do the decent thing and resign .

Scotland 's First Minister , the SNP 's Nicola Sturgeon , said the ruling was the most significant constitutional judgement in her lifetime , and it would be `` unthinkable '' for Mr Johnson to remain in office .\nWales ' First Minister , Labour 's Mark Drakeford , said the court 's decision had been a `` victory for the rule of law '' and the PM had `` tried to play fast and loose with our constitution '' .\nIn Northern Ireland , the leader of the DUP , Arlene Foster , said the ruling must be respected , while Sinn Fein 's vice president , Michelle O'Neill , said Mr Johnson should resign .\nOther figures have taken to Twitter to support the court 's decision , including former Tory minister Amber Rudd , who resigned her post - and the party whip - over the government 's approach to Brexit .\nThe leader of The Brexit Party , Nigel Farage , said Mr Johnson must , `` as a matter of honour '' , offer his resignation to MPs in Parliament on Wednesday .\nThe decision to prorogue Parliament had been a `` disaster '' , he added , and there must be a general election `` before very long because Parliament and the government have ceased to function '' .\nFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve , who has been an outspoken critic of the suspension , said he was `` not surprised '' by the judgement because of the `` gross misbehaviour by the prime minister '' .\nHe told the BBC 's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was `` delighted '' the Supreme Court had `` stopped this unconstitutional act in its tracks '' .\nBut Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the court 's decision was `` the worst possible outcome for our democracy '' and `` an absolute disgrace '' .\nHe told the same programme : `` What we 've got is a Parliament that 's completely out of step with sentiment of the country . ''\nFellow Tory MP and chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group Steve Baker said the ruling was an `` earthquake moment '' .\nHe described the Commons as a `` rotten Parliament '' facing a `` crisis '' , and called for a general election so a government with a majority could move forward .\nProrogation is a power that rests with the Queen , carried out by her on the advice of the prime minister .\nAnd at the end of August - shortly before MPs returned from their summer recess - Mr Johnson called Her Majesty to advise she suspend Parliament between 9 September until 14 October .\nMPs had been expecting to be in recess for some of these weeks for their party conferences .\nBut unlike prorogation , a recess must be agreed by a vote , and a number of MPs said they would have voted against it to ensure they could scrutinise Mr Johnson 's Brexit plans .\nThe decision to prorogue prompted an uproar from the Commons , especially from MPs who had planned to take control of Parliament to force through a law to block a no-deal Brexit after Mr Johnson said the UK would leave the EU with or without a deal on the Halloween deadline .\nDespite only sitting for a week , they did manage to pass that law ahead of prorogation and it received royal assent on 9 September .\nWhat questions do you have about the Supreme Court 's decision ?", "The race to become Britain 's next prime minister took a dramatic last-minute turn with former London Mayor Boris Johnson -- considered a front-runner -- ruling himself out of the race after the defection of a key ally on Thursday .\nJohnson , a prominent campaigner for British withdrawal from the European Union , told a news conference that the next Conservative Party leader would have needs to ensure Britain 's standing in the world .\n`` Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in Parliament , I have concluded that person can not be me , '' he said .\nJohnson dropped out after Justice Secretary Michael Gove , Johnson 's ally in the EU `` leave '' campaign , astonished the political world by announcing that he was running to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron .\nHome Secretary Theresa May and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb are also in the race .\nThe winner of the contest , to be announced Sept. 9 , will become prime minister and play a vital role shaping the nature of Britain 's relationship with the European Union after last week 's Brexit vote ended the career of Cameron , whose bid to keep Britain in the EU block failed .\nThe bookies ' early favorite is May , who is seen by many in the party as a safe pair of hands as the country struggles to disentangle itself from the EU .\n`` This is not a normal leadership held under normal circumstances , '' May said in a speech Thursday in London . `` The result means we face a period of uncertainty we need to address head on . ''\nAlthough May had offered a tepid endorsement of Britain 's place in the European Union during the referendum campaign , she was clear that the vote would be respected .\n`` The United Kingdom will leave the EU , '' she said , pledging to create a brand new government department devoted to negotiating Britain 's `` sensible and orderly '' departure from the 28-nation bloc .\nBoosting May 's chances was a last-minute falling out between her two leading competitors -- Gove and Johnson -- who had campaigned together to yank Britain from the EU .\nIn a statement , Gove said he would pursue the prime minister 's post after concluding that Johnson `` can not provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead . ''\nAn email from Gove 's wife , Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine , obtained earlier by Sky News , suggested that Gove should ensure he had specific guarantees from Johnson before backing the latter 's bid .\nShe added that influential right-wing media barons Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre `` instinctively dislike '' Johnson .\nThe opposition Labour Party is also is extreme disarray , with leader Jeremy Corbyn facing intense pressure to resign after losing a confidence vote . He has lost the support of the party 's lawmakers but claims the rank and file still back him\nHe is expected to face a formal leadership challenge in the coming days .

Fifty people have been confirmed as injured , with 31 requiring hospital treatment . Two police officers remained in hospital with significant injuries .\nOn Thursday night , thousands of people gathered to commemorate the victims of the attack in Westminster , and to hear speeches by the capital \u2019 s mayor and other leaders aimed at preventing terrorism from spreading division and hatred .\nThe vigil in Trafalgar Square , central London , was held to honour the dead and injured , Sadiq Khan said , but also \u201c to send a clear , clear , message \u2013 Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism \u201d .\nWestminster vigil : we will never be cowed by terrorism , says mayor Read more\nEarlier , prime minister Theresa May told MPs Masood had been previously known to MI5 : \u201c Some years ago , he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism . He was a peripheral figure . The case is historic \u2013 he was not part of the current intelligence picture . \u201d\nAmber Rudd , the home secretary , later added that Masood had spent time in jail , but not for terrorist offences , while the Metropolitan police said \u201c Masood \u201d was in all likelihood not his birth name .\nThe names of two people who died after Masood mowed them down on Westminster Bridge also emerged .\nThey were Kurt Cochran , 54 , a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary , and British-born Aysha Frade , 43 , who worked at sixth-form college and had been walking over the bridge to pick up her daughters from school .\nIn the frenzied attack on Wednesday , Masood also stabbed to death PC Keith Palmer , a 48-year-old husband and father .\nThe prime minister said Palmer was \u201c every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten \u201d , while a crowdfunding appeal for his family has raised more than \u00a3364,000 .\nThe attack was stopped when armed officers assigned to protect the defence secretary , Michael Fallon , shot Masood , who is believed to have been intent on entering parliament . Palmer died at New Palace Yard on the edge of the parliamentary estate , near Parliament Square , raising questions about security for legislators .\nThe original incident , in which Masood drove a Hyundai Tucson 4x4 into crowds at one of London \u2019 s busiest tourist spots , left 40 people injured , 29 of whom were taken to hospital .\nIn an emergency statement to the Commons , May said people from around the world had been caught up in the attack . \u201c In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital , we know the victims include three French children , two Romanians , four South Koreans , one German , one Pole , one Irish , one Chinese , one Italian , one American and two Greeks , \u201d she said .\nLondon terror attack : what we know so far Read more\nShe also sounded a note of defiance , telling MPs : \u201c Today we meet as normal , as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do , to deliver a simple message : we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism . \u201d\nMay \u2019 s spokesman said she had received phone calls from world leaders including Angela Merkel , Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Donald Trump , offering their condolences and support , and had herself signed a book of condolence in parliament . She later visited the injured in hospital .\nPolice said Masood had been inspired by Islamic State . But he hid his extremism from his neighbours , coming across as a keen gardener and family man .\nThe domestic intelligence service will face questions over why Masood dropped off the radar after being investigated in relation to concerns over violent extremism .\nAn MI5 team has been set up to see what lessons can be learned from the case and to look at the decision to not put him under surveillance . The police and security services monitor an estimated 3,000 Britons , mainly Islamists , regarded as capable of terrorism , but it emerged he was not on this list .\nIsis claimed responsibilty for the attack , although the claim could not be verified . Amaq , the news agency it uses to broadcast propaganda , issued a statement describing the attacker as a soldier of Islamic State , without naming him .\nPolice revealed that Masood , born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964 , had a string of criminal convictions . In a statement , the Met said : \u201c He was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults , including GBH , possession of offensive weapons and public order offences .\n\u201c His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife . \u201d\nThe investigation is being led by SO15 , Scotland Yard \u2019 s counter-terrorism command .

Romek , 45 , said her experience of him was of a \u201c nice man \u201d .\nShe said the family had moved out suddenly in December 2016 and added : \u201c I used to see him outside doing his garden . Never any trouble . \u201d\nIt is believed that Masood rented the Hyundai car that he turned into a weapon of terror from the depot of a car hire firm , Enterprise , in Spring Hill , Birmingham .\nPolice still believe the attack was carried out by Masood alone , but are looking into whether others helped him . The eight arrests were all on suspicion of acts of preparation of a terrorist act , a key indication that police are investigating the possibility of a wider conspiracy .\nA 39-year-old woman was arrested in east London , while two women aged 26 and 21 were detained in Birmingham . Five men aged 23 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 58 were arrested in Birmingham .\nPC Palmer \u2019 s family released a statement paying tribute to the police officer , who had a five-year-old daughter .

In his opening bid , he told Republicans in the House to quickly pass tax legislation that would mean a rate increase for the wealthy , but keep rates low for everyone else .\nBut Republicans have rejected that plan repeatedly , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , instead said it was up to President Obama to make overtures to Republicans now that he has secured election to a second term .\nThe White House , though , was in no mood to break from its pre-election posture . Press secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama still will veto any bill that doesn \u2019 t include a tax-rate increase on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans , and shot down other proposals , such as cutting out loopholes but not raising the rates themselves , as \u201c hypotheticals . \u201d\n\u201c What I can tell you is that the president will not sign a bill that extends tax cuts for the top 2 percent with an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts , \u201d Mr. Carney said .\nCongress had been in recess for most of the past two months , and lawmakers watched with bemusement as their colleagues dug in again .\n\u201c People are stuck in suspended animation , \u201d said Sen. Ben Nelson , a Nebraska Democrat who is retiring at the end of this year . \u201c My hope is that as everybody adjusts to the outcome of the election and looks to their positions that maybe then action will occur . But if it doesn \u2019 t , then this country is stuck in neutral . But the problem with being stuck is neutral is that it is actually reverse . \u201d\nMr. Nelson said he doesn \u2019 t want to talk about raising more tax revenues until he has seen more spending cuts put on the table .\nRepublicans say they are willing to break with their past stance and allow the government to collect more revenue \u2014 though for now , they don \u2019 t appear to be talking about new direct money from higher taxes .\nInstead , they propose a streamlined tax code , with lower rates and fewer deductions , which they say will expand the economy . With a better economy , they say , the government can take in more money .\nHowever , budget analysts have said the hole is so deep that the government can not grow its way out of the problem , and will need either deep spending cuts , significant tax increases or a combination of the two in order to bring the deficit to manageable levels .\nMr. Obama and Democrats have said they need to see tax rates rise , while Republicans have said entitlement programs must face spending cuts .\nBut both sides are also under enormous pressure to resist each other \u2019 s demands . On Tuesday , Mr. Obama met with liberal leaders at the White House and they urged him to reject any deal that would cut Social Security or Medicare .\n\u201c The truth is America does not face an \u2018 entitlement crisis. \u2019 We should not be cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits to put our fiscal house in order , \u201d said Max Richtman , president of the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare .\nThe so-called fiscal cliff hits early next year . The Bush-era tax cuts expire Jan. 1 , and $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts take effect Jan. 2 as a result of last year \u2019 s debt deal . The tax increases would apply across the board , while the spending cuts would be divided equally between defense and domestic appropriations .\nTogether , they would plunge the economy into a short but sharp recession \u2014 though the tax increases and spending cuts also would reduce the budget deficit dramatically in 2013 , and would produce a stronger economy by the end of the decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office .\nSome Democrats have suggested that their party should let the fiscal cliff hit and then negotiate from a position of strength when Democrats get additional members early next year . They gained seats last week in both chambers , though they will hold a majority only in the Senate .\nBut House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , flatly rejected that Tuesday .\n\u201c I want you to be disabused of any notion that there \u2019 s any widespread thought that it would be a good thing for our country for us to go over the cliff , \u201d she told reporters .\nGetting there , however , will take a deal \u2014 which has been elusive for the past 18 months .\nMr. Obama has invited congressional leaders to the White House on Friday to start negotiations anew .\nIn one ominous sign , the Senate picked up right where it left off in September , fighting over a bill to open more federal lands to fishing and hunting .\nMr. Reid used procedural tactics to lock out Republican amendments , saying the GOP is threatening to delay the bill , as it did with many of Democrats \u2019 priorities over the past two years .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t imagine why we \u2019 re still fighting the battles of the last election , \u201d he said .\nBut Republicans say Mr. Reid is pushing a partisan agenda and in restricting amendments he is refusing to allow the freewheeling debate the Senate usually enjoys .", "-- The estimated cost of compliance to American taxpayers in 2010 , including tax preparation fees , hours worked and other costs , according to the IRS .\nIt \u2019 s D-Day for President Obama \u2019 s health law as millions of American tax filers face the deadline for reporting their status under Obama \u2019 s new entitlement program and their vulnerability to new taxes used to fund it .\nAmericans have been paying the biggest new taxes associated with the law since the beginning of the year : a .9 percent income tax and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income , both for top earners .\nWhile the estimated cost of those taxes is $ 318 billon over the next decade , like this year \u2019 s other big tax hike , the 48 percent jump in the payroll tax rate for all workers , they occur automatically and don \u2019 t create sticker shock except for those who count every penny in every paycheck .\nAmericans are also already living with two other costly tax increases in the law .\nThose facing huge medical bills were previously able to deduct any expenses above 7.5 percent of their annual income . That \u2019 s now 10 percent . This is a relatively small number of people , mostly with serious illnesses , and the pinch won \u2019 t come until they file their taxes next year .\nThe other change is a new cap on health savings accounts , now set at $ 2,500 . But consumers already got that word during the enrollment period for their health plans at the end of last year . Many will pay higher taxes , but in small sums mostly . ( The point of this regulation was more to discourage cash-based purchases of medical services and products and drive people into more expensive , comprehensive insurance plans to help insurance companies cover costs under the law . )\nBut today is the day when the compliance curve of the president \u2019 s law really starts to get steeper .\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that whatever Obama and congressional Democrats called the penalty under the law for not having insurance , it is still a tax . And one can see why , since the initial point of contact for the uninsured with the law comes through the IRS .\nThe government will be using the tax returns due today to decide who will receive an estimated $ 25 billion in new insurance subsidies next year .\nEnrollment in the new entitlement program is set to begin on Oct. 1 . The complex process of enrollment looks to be an even more daunting task than tax preparation . And with many states functioning differently and delays piling up , it could be a real goat rope .\nBut whatever comes out and whenever it goes into place , the tax returns due today will provide the initial basis for how one \u2019 s relationship with the government and health insurance functions .\nThose making up to 400 percent of federal poverty levels -- $ 43,560 for an individual and $ 89,400 for a family of four in 2011 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2013 will be eligible for the new benefit .\nThe government will know from the tax forms due today how many Americans fall into that category . The government will still be working from estimates on how many of those folks in the subsidy zone don \u2019 t have insurance , but these forms will define the universe of those who may be eligible .\nThen those individuals in the subsidy zone without insurance will have to decide whether to sign up for the program or face a fine .\nBy Tax Day 2015 all American taxpayers will have to provide proof of insurance to the IRS , so today starts the clock for those without insurance to either comply or face the penalty -- $ 95 for 2014 , $ 325 for 2015 and $ 695 for 2016 .\nThe purpose of the \u201c mandate \u201d in Obama \u2019 s law is to start herding people into the re-regulated insurance market , and Tax Day 2013 is the start of that great health insurance cattle drive .\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com .

A Democratic member of the committee said earlier this month he believed the panel would ask for Trump \u2019 s returns in a few weeks .\nDemocrats view the documents as a potential linchpin for oversight investigations , saying they would show whether the president has complied with U.S. tax law , profited from his own tax cuts , or has conflicts of interest from his vast business holdings .\nNeal \u2019 s committee could seek both his personal and business returns .\nTrump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release his tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president , saying his returns were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service . The IRS has said that Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit .\nInterest in Trump \u2019 s returns has soared since his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told a House panel on Feb. 27 that the president has altered his value of assets and slashed the wages of his employees to lower his tax bills .\nSection 6103 of the U.S. tax code allows the chairs of three committees \u2014 Neal \u2019 s House panel , the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 to request confidential tax returns , and says the Treasury secretary \u201c shall furnish \u201d the documents .\nBut requesting the tax returns of a sitting president is unprecedented . Fearing a lengthy court battle for the documents , Neal \u2019 s committee has spent months working to develop a winning legal argument that could base the quest firmly within the panel \u2019 s jurisdiction to oversee the U.S. tax system .\nSenator Chuck Grassley , the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , is also expected to seek Trump \u2019 s taxes if Democrats obtain them .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an awful lot of interest in 6103 today , \u201d Mnuchin said . He said he would not speculate on a specific strategy for handling a request from lawmakers because he has not yet received one .", "Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the party \u2019 s brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend . Yet they may have no choice : Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , said this week that she opposed lowering the top tax rate for individuals earning more than $ 1 million , creating pressure for Republicans to include a higher bracket in order to win passage .\nRepublican lawmakers are selling their plan as a middle-class tax cut , and the bill is expected to create three income tax brackets \u2014 12 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent \u2014 and call for doubling the standard deduction . Yet lawmakers are considering making these changes temporary , so they would expire after 10 years .\nThe conventional wisdom is that a future Congress will vote to continue the cuts and not allow them to expire . But that \u2019 s a tricky assumption given their cost , which will only exacerbate a federal deficit already on an upward trajectory . The Treasury Department said the deficit for the fiscal year 2017 grew by $ 80 billion , to $ 666 billion . Federal debt , which has already topped $ 20 trillion , is expected to grow by an additional $ 10 trillion over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office .\nCompounding the math problem is that the plan would probably make the corporate tax cuts permanent . Lawmakers argue that a permanent cut , to 20 percent from today \u2019 s 35 percent rate , is needed to trigger the economic growth they anticipate , and they say it will ultimately put more money into workers \u2019 pockets .\nStill , those corporate tax cuts are expected to cost $ 2 trillion over the next decade and , to help make the budget work , lawmakers are discussing phasing in the corporate tax cut over several years to get to the 20 percent rate . The White House on Monday seemed to suggest that was a nonstarter .\nThe original framework called for repealing the estate tax , which would reduce federal revenues by $ 239 billion over a decade .\nEstates are taxed at a rate of 40 percent , but the first $ 5.49 million of an inheritance is exempt from taxation . Couples can leave their heirs as much as $ 11 million , none of it taxed , meaning only a few thousand wealthy estates are subject to the tax each year .", "( CNN ) \u2013 A new plan from President Barack Obama that would alter the corporate tax code while investing in job creation is a deal that any `` serious '' lawmaker could sign onto , the president argued in Tennessee Tuesday .\nWhat Obama called a `` grand bargain '' is being proposed in a bid to break partisan gridlock currently plaguing attempts to pass major legislation in Washington , though congressional Republicans signaled on Tuesday they were unlikely to back the plan , which the president announced at an Amazon.com distribution center in Chattanooga .\n`` Here 's the bottom line : If folks in Washington really want a 'grand bargain , ' how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs ? '' Obama said in his fourth speech in a week centered on the economy . `` I do n't want to go through the same old arguments , where I propose an idea and Republicans say no just because it 's my idea . So I 'm going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support . ''\nObama suggested Congress cut corporate tax rates - long a goal of Republicans - while simultaneously making investments in job creation programs , which Democrats and the president have been championing .\nIn the past , both Obama and Republicans have insisted that corporate tax reform be passed alongside reform for individual earners . Republicans argue that some small business owners file taxes as individuals , and would only benefit from an overhaul of the entire tax code .\nThe president 's plan would propose slashing the corporate tax rate to 28 % from 35 % while making the filing process simpler and ramping up incentives for small businesses to hire workers .\nThe plan would also put the tax rate on manufacturers at 25 % and remove current tax incentives to send jobs overseas .\nOn Tuesday , Obama explained that he 's open to changing only the corporate tax code as long as it 's combined with major investments in programs that create high-paying middle class jobs .\n`` If we 're going to give businesses a better deal , we 're also going to have to give workers a better deal , too , '' he said , suggesting money saved by closing tax loopholes should be put toward infrastructure initiatives that would create construction jobs .\nObama also called for bolstering the country 's manufacturing sector and network of community colleges , and proposed creating 45 `` innovation institutes '' that pair companies with universities and community colleges with the goal of fostering research and development .\nEarly reaction from Republicans to the outlines of the president 's plan was not receptive .\n`` While I understand he is looking for headlines here , reports indicate that the policy he intends to announce does n't exactly qualify as news , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday . `` It is just a further left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago , this time with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals . ''\nMcConnell said he first learned of the plan Monday night . Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , wrote on Twitter his office learned of the proposed `` grand bargain '' through media reports , though White House officials said they reached out to a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday to discuss the proposal .\nMichael Steel , another spokesman for Boehner , cast the proposal as old news .\n`` The President has always supported corporate tax reform , '' Steel wrote in a statement . `` Republicans want to help families and small businesses , too . This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama 's position on taxes and President Obama 's position on spending , while leaving small businesses and American families behind . ''\nAnother House Republican leadership aide said the White House was taking their own plan and making it less amenable to Republicans than previous offers , while `` trying to extract a ransom of infrastructure spending '' at the same time .\nThe aide argued the new White House plan was an attempt to `` get a headline that says they 're offering a grand bargain . ''\nObama 's address in Chattanooga is the latest in a series of speeches the president will deliver on the economy and jobs , part of an attempt to turn back to the issue that rates as most important among Americans . The tour began last week in Illinois , Missouri and Florida .\nTuesday 's announcement of a `` grand bargain '' was the first specific proposal the president made in his new push to focus on the economy , though White House officials say there will be more as the initiative continues .\nDuring his remarks , Obama said he 'd `` keep throwing things out there to see if something takes '' on jobs .\n`` If ( Republicans ) have better ideas to help create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure , or help workers earn the high-tech skills our businesses demand , let 's hear 'em , '' the president said .\nAmazon.com , whose facility Obama spoke at Tuesday , announced this week plans to hire 7,000 workers for its U.S. operation , with most jobs offering pay and benefits far above typical retail wages , the company said .\nAmazon did not give specific pay scales for the positions , but said the 5,000 warehouse jobs will pay 30 % more than jobs in traditional retail stores .\nThe jobs are full-time permanent positions and also include stock grants that , over the last five years , have averaged 9 % of pay for Amazon 's full-time workers . And the company said many workers would also be eligible for 95 % tuition reimbursement for those attending college , whether or not their field of study is related to their job .\nIn addition , Amazon is looking for 2,000 workers for its customer service department , with those jobs being a mix of full-time , part-time and seasonal positions .", "( CNN ) The rain may have stopped , but South Carolina is grappling with a host of new concerns .

A true American patriot and a man of rare vision , principle and deep compassion , he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors , '' Fuller said in a statement .

More than two decades later , he launched information technology services provider Perot Systems , which was acquired in 2009 by Dell for $ 3.9 billion . As a disruptive third-party candidate for president , Perot ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility and protectionism . He won nearly 19 % of the vote in the 1992 race \u2014 by far the biggest slice of the electorate for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt 's Bull Moose Party in the 1912 election .\nPerot stood out from the political crowd for his quirks as much as his business credentials and lack of experience in establishment politics . `` I do n't have any experience in running up a $ 4 trillion debt . I do n't have any experience in gridlock government , where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else , '' he said in a 1992 presidential debate . The shifting of U.S. jobs to Mexico created a `` giant sucking sound , '' he famously said during the campaign . Perot participated in all three presidential debates in that election , and took a nontraditional campaign route by booking lengthy time slots on network television to lay out his political views .

The list included Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning , longtime imprisoned Puerto Rican independence activist Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera and retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Cartwright . But missing from the list is 71-year-old Native American activist Leonard Peltier .\nLater in the program , we \u2019 ll look at the cases of Peltier and Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera , but first to Chelsea Manning , who \u2019 s now set to be free May 17th , after Obama shortened her sentence from 35 years to seven . According to her attorneys , she is already the longest-held whistleblower in U.S. history . She \u2019 s been in military custody since May 2010 . Manning leaked more than 700,000 classified files and videos to WikiLeaks about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. foreign policy . She \u2019 s been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinement and denied medical treatment related to her gender identity . Chelsea Manning attempted to commit suicide twice last year .\nJoining us now are two of her attorneys . Nancy Hollander is Manning \u2019 s appellate attorney . Chase Strangio of the ACLU represents Manning in a lawsuit against the Pentagon for denial of medical care related to her gender dysphoria . Also with us is The Intercept \u2019 s Jeremy Scahill , author of the recent piece , \u201c The True Scandal of 2016 was the Torture of Chelsea Manning . \u201d\nWe welcome you all to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! Chase Strangio , your response to what President Obama did yesterday ?\nCHASE STRANGIO : Well , I just\u2014I first want to thank you and everyone who supported Chelsea over the years . The reality is that this was a mass mobilization effort , keeping her story alive , led by Chelsea herself and all of the people who made sure that nobody forgot the justice that she fought for and the incredible symbol of democratic principles and advocacy that she really embodies . Yesterday was an incredible day for us who care about her . As I \u2019 ve said time and time again , President Obama really had her life in his hands . And it \u2019 s such a relief that he acted on the side of mercy and justice here .\nCHASE STRANGIO : Unfortunately , we haven \u2019 t spoken to Chelsea , which is a bit concerning , but we \u2019 re remaining hopeful that we will be able to speak with her today and actually be able to share this news . It \u2019 s quite unusual for the individual to not be informed of their commutation with their attorneys . But we know that , you know , she was on standby , waiting for this . I spoke with her yesterday around 2:00 p.m. , and she was just her sort of hopeful , pragmatic self , waiting for news . And we were all hoping and praying with her . So , hopefully , today we \u2019 ll connect with her and get to share in this incredible moment that really did save her life .\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah , absolutely . She has served seven years already . The 35-year sentence was egregious at the time . It \u2019 s particularly egregious in retrospect . And she has served seven years . It is absolutely preposterous to hear people saying that there are no consequences for her actions . She has been tortured and imprisoned , denied basic medical care . She has suffered so much , and it is time for her to be free .\nAMY GOODMAN : Nancy Hollander , the response on the networks\u2014I was watching CNN last night . The overwhelming response of the guests that they \u2019 ve had on\u2014let me go to some of the comments . Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement protesting the commutation , saying , quote , \u201c This is just outrageous . Chelsea Manning \u2019 s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation \u2019 s most sensitive secrets . President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won \u2019 t be held accountable for their crimes. \u201d Meanwhile , Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona called the commutation a \u201c grave mistake \u201d that may , quote , \u201c encourage further acts of espionage and undermine military discipline. \u201d He added , quote , \u201c Thousands of Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq upholding their oaths and defending this nation . Chelsea Manning broke her oath and made it more likely that others would join the ranks of her fallen comrades . Her prison sentence may end in a few months \u2019 [ time ] , but her dishonor will last forever , \u201d McCain said . Nancy Hollander , your response ?\nNANCY HOLLANDER : They \u2019 re totally\u2014it \u2019 s just false . The secretary of defense at the time , Gates , said that the worst that happened was some embarrassment for the United States . There was not a single individual ever identified who was harmed by what Chelsea did . What Chelsea did actually helped the United States . It helped Americans . It helped people around the world understand about human rights violations , understand\u2014bring war home to people . She wanted people to see what happens to somebody who gets killed , what happens to people in Iraq and Afghanistan . She wanted to make this real , so that we would stop doing these kinds of things to people . And so , what they \u2019 re saying is exactly the opposite of what Chelsea did . There has never been a single bit of evidence that anybody was harmed or that national security was harmed .", "Steve Stephens , the so-called \u201c Facebook killer \u201d who sparked a multi-state manhunt after he brazenly gunned down a Cleveland man at random , killed himself Tuesday morning in Pennsylvania as cops closed in , authorities said .\nStephens was spotted in a McDonald 's parking lot in Erie County just after 11 a.m. by a member of the public who quickly contacted Pennsylvania State Police .

''\nObama promised `` a new culture of accountability '' under new Secretary Bob McDonald . `` Bob does n't play , '' Obama said .\nHe announced steps to strengthen access to mental health care by members of the military , to improve the transition for those leaving the military from care administered by the Defense Department to that run by Veterans Affairs , and to foster suicide prevention and better treatments for post-traumatic stress syndrome .\nEarlier this month , Obama signed a $ 16.3 billion law aimed at easing the long waits that tens of thousands of military veterans had endured to get medical care .\nThe law , a product of rare bipartisanship in the House and Senate , followed reports of veterans dying while awaiting appointments to see VA doctors and of a widespread practice of employees covering up months-long wait times for appointments . In some cases , employees received bonuses based on falsified records .\nThe VA says investigators have found no proof that delays in care caused any deaths at a VA hospital in Phoenix .\nMoving beyond the steps included in the law , Obama planned to take executive actions that :\n\u2014 Automatically enroll military personnel who are receiving care for mental health conditions and are leaving the service in a program that transfers them to a new care team in the VA .\n\u2014 Undertake a study designed to detect whether people show signs of being vulnerable to suicide or post-traumatic stress syndrome .\n\u2014 Spends $ 34.4 million in a VA suicide prevention study and about $ 80 million on a program to treat diseases , including post-traumatic stress syndrome .\nObama also announced a partnership with lenders such as Wells Fargo Bank , CitiMortgage , Bank of America , Ocwen Loan Servicing and Quicken Loans to make it easier for active-duty service members to obtain mortgage interest rate reductions .", "In attacking Donald Trump , President Obama has managed to anger one of the nation \u2019 s largest and oldest veterans \u2019 groups .\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars took offense at Mr. Obama \u2019 s assertion that its members are confused by right-wing media pundits .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how many VFW posts the president has ever visited , \u201d VFW National Commander John A. Biedrzycki Jr. said Thursday , \u201c but our near 1.7 million members are a direct reflection of America , which means we represent every generation , race , religion , gender and political and ideological viewpoint . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c We don \u2019 t have confused politics , we don \u2019 t need left- or right-wing media filters telling us how to think or vote , and we don \u2019 t need any president of the United States lecturing us about how we are individually effected by the economy . \u201d\nDuring a speech Wednesday in Elkhart , Indiana Mr. Obama said , \u201c I \u2019 m concerned when I watch the direction of our politics . I mean , we have been hearing this story for decades \u2014 tales about welfare queens , talking about takers , talking about the 47 percent . It \u2019 s the story that \u2019 s broadcast every day on some cable news stations , on right-wing radio . It \u2019 s pumped into cars and bars and VFW halls all across America , and right here in Elkhart . \u201d\nThe president went on , \u201c If you \u2019 re hearing that story all the time , you start believing it . It \u2019 s no wonder people think big government is the problem . No wonder public support for unions is so low . No wonder that people think the deficit has gone up under my presidency when it \u2019 s actually gone down . \u201d\n\u201c Our nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform , \u201d he said . \u201c Let \u2019 s not denigrate their service , their sacrifice or their intelligence . \u201d", "Story highlights Obama 's plan was for a `` smarter and better '' government with demonstrable benefits\nGloria Borger says President is instead staring down rabbit hole of government incompetence\nShe says the VA scandal , after the health care website woes , highlights the problem\nBorger : Obama can be effective in managing but needs to grab control of bureaucracy\nWhen Barack Obama was a newbie president , there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead . Government should be seen as a force for good , not evil . Sure , he told us , it needed to be `` smarter and better , '' but that could\u2014and would\u2014happen under his watch .\nNever mind that Bill Clinton spent years `` reinventing government '' with mixed success . Or that only 2 % of the American public believes that government can be trusted to do the right thing all the time . President Obama was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for America\u2014such as health care reform\u2014and the public would be grateful .\nInstead , the President is living his own version of `` Alice Through the Looking Glass '' : staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency . The government he has studiously tried to grow , manage and change has become his own personal nemesis . All of which makes you wonder : Does the President himself trust government anymore ?\nThe scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the Obama presidency : Making government work . Consider the disastrous health care website rollout . The IRS controversy . Even the question of NSA surveillance raises questions about the role of government : Did the civil libertarian Obama allow spies to run amok ?\nThe President is clearly having a running debate with himself over all this . About a year ago , after the NSA program was revealed and Democrats and libertarians started squawking , Obama seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying . `` If people ca n't trust not only the executive branch but also do n't trust Congress ... to make sure that we 're abiding by the Constitution ... '' he said , `` then we 're going to have some problems here . ''\nThese are not trivial matters . Health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration , and a botched rollout made it smell bad at the start . Fixing the VA\u2014and aiding veterans\u2014is a cornerstone of the Obama presidency . And yet , it all looks as if somehow the bureaucracy has beaten the boss .\nJUST WATCHED House Committee grills VA witnesses Replay More Videos ...

So far as I can tell , the governing style of this administration has two extremes : issues singled out for micromanagement ( as in , foreign policy , from the West Wing ) and issues completely delegated ( as in , VA management ) . What seems to be missing is the in-between : the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding . That 's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done .\nAnd it can get done . The apparatus to do the nation 's business in a competent way is there . Use it , and manage it . That 's what chief executives are hired to do .\nGovernment is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame , sure . But if your presidency is based , in large part , on telling Americans that government can work for them -- which it can -- you need to make it work .\nIt 's not that the President is a hopeless manager . He does very well when he leads a hierarchical organization with a single goal , like a presidential bid . He 's top dog , he 's not negotiating with anybody , and he 's not trying to get people to do things they do n't want to do . In a campaign , for instance , they all want to elect the same person : him .\nBut when you have to negotiate\u2014or lead\u2014people not related to you , or not indebted to you or who do n't agree with you , it 's a different story . Managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives ( Congress , anyone ? ) is not an Obama strong point .\nBy nature , bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame . And if a chief executive is n't careful , it 's an energy-sapping ( and legacy endangering ) vortex that sucks you right in . Just ask Obama , who was government 's best friend .\nDoes he still feel that way today ? Hard to know . But my guess is he 's a bit like Alice in Wonderland . `` I ca n't go back to yesterday , '' she said , `` because I was a different person then . ''", "One of Donald Trump \u2019 s major themes on the 2016 campaign trail was the need to improve the health care offerings afforded to America \u2019 s veterans . We \u2019 re going to \u201c take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before \u201d was a fairly typical stump speech line , though he sometimes shortened it to simply a brief promise to \u201c take care of our vets . \u201d\nThis was typically laced with references to the spring 2014 VA scandal and devoid of references to the bipartisan reform legislation that passed in the wake of the scandal . Trump didn \u2019 t particularly have a policy critique of the Obama administration and never so much as mentioned any of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s policy ideas on the issue \u2014 the pitch he was making was , broadly , that Democrats didn \u2019 t respect or care about veterans as much as he did .\nWednesday he held meetings at his Florida estate with private sector health care leaders to discuss ways to improve things , and then , as described by the New York Times \u2019 s Michael Shear , briefed the press on his thinking :\nMr. Trump met with several executives of private hospital systems at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Wednesday . After the meeting , Mr. Trump called out to reporters , saying he wanted to describe his ideas for changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs , but then quickly directed one of his senior aides to describe the proposals under consideration . The official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , provided no details about how the plans would work , how much they would cost , or the possibility of unintended consequences from privatizing part of the V.A. \u2019 s sprawling medical system .\nLooking back to the campaign trail , it \u2019 s not hard to see what Trump was doing . Whether it was taking care of vets or respecting cops or reopening coal mines or getting Americans jobs in steel mills , wherever there was a stereotypically male occupational category , Trump was there to rhetorically elevate its social status .\nHe did not actually have a specific criticism of the veterans \u2019 health care status quo or a specific plan to improve it , and I think Americans in the relevant parts of the country will soon find that he doesn \u2019 t have a plan to bring back coal mining or labor-intensive forms of domestic steel production either . In many cases , that reality probably won \u2019 t cost Trump votes . Voting for the guy who praises steel and coal and cops and veterans rather than the woman talking about reducing student debt is at least as much a matter of identity politics as it is a matter of policy . After all , anyone interested enough in the details of veterans \u2019 health policy or energy policy could have figured out pretty quickly that there was no substance to Trump \u2019 s plans .\nBut there probably are some people out there who voted for Trump on the assumption that he had some notion of how to accomplish the things he \u2019 s promised . If so , they \u2019 re set to be sorely disappointed .", "The VA 's Broken Promise To Thousands Of Vets Exposed To Mustard Gas\nIn secret chemical weapons experiments conducted during World War II , the U.S. military exposed thousands of American troops to mustard gas .\nWhen those experiments were formally declassified in the 1990s , the Department of Veterans Affairs made two promises : to locate about 4,000 men who were used in the most extreme tests , and to compensate those who had permanent injuries .\nBut the VA did n't uphold those promises , an NPR investigation has found .\nNPR interviewed more than 40 living test subjects and family members , and they describe an unending cycle of appeals and denials as they struggled to get government benefits for mustard gas exposure . Some gave up out of frustration .\nIn more than 20 years , the VA attempted to reach just 610 of the men , with a single letter sent in the mail . Brad Flohr , a VA senior adviser for benefits , says the agency could n't find the rest , because military records of the experiments were incomplete .\n`` There was no identifying information , '' he says . `` No Social Security numbers , no addresses , no ... way of identifying them . Although , we tried . ''\nYet in just two months , an NPR research librarian located more than 1,200 of them , using the VA 's own list of test subjects and public records .\nThe mustard gas experiments were conducted at a time when American intelligence showed that enemy gas attacks were imminent . The tests evaluated protective equipment like gas masks and suits . They also compared the relative sensitivity of soldiers , including tests designed to look for racial difference .\nThe test subjects who are still alive are now in their 80s and 90s . Each year more of their stories die with them .\n`` We were n't told what it was , '' says Charlie Cavell , who was 19 when he volunteered for the program in exchange for two weeks ' vacation . `` Until we actually got into the process of being in that room and realized , wait a minute , we ca n't get out of here . ''\nCavell and 11 other volunteers were locked inside a gas chamber with mustard gas piping inside . Blocks of ice sat on shelves overhead with fans blowing across them to increase the humidity in the room , which intensified mustard gas 's effects on the body . After an hour , the officer released six of the men back to their barracks . Cavell and five others were told to stay put .\nInside the chamber , Cavell 's skin started to turn red and burn in the places where he sweat the most : between his legs , behind his neck and under his arms . Blisters that eventually increased to the size of half dollar coins started to grow in the same places . At the end of the second hour , the officer ordered Cavell back to his barracks and to continue wearing his gas-saturated uniform .\nAbout This Investigation This is Part 2 of a two-part investigation on mustard gas testing conducted by the U.S. military during World War II . The first story in this report focused on race-based experiments done as part of the military 's chemical warfare program : NPR News Investigations Secret World War II Chemical Experiments Tested Troops By Race\nCavell , now 88 years old , says the officer threatened him and the other test subjects : If they told anyone about their knowledge or participation in the experiments , they would receive a dishonorable discharge and be sent to military prison at Fort Leavenworth , Kan .\n`` They put the fear of God in just a bunch of young kids , '' he says .\nThese experiments with mustard gas were conducted by the Army and Navy at more than a dozen locations . Some test subjects had only partial exposure , such as having the chemical agents applied directly onto their skin . Others were locked in gas chambers , like Cavell . A third type of test exposed troops to gas outdoors in simulated combat settings .\nIn all , roughly 60,000 World War II veterans were used as test subjects , and they kept the experiments secret for half a century . A group of them , led by Nat Schnurman , went public with their stories in 1990 .\nSchnurman , who died in 2013 when he was 87 , had suffered debilitating injuries after being tested at the U.S . Naval Training Center in Bainbridge , Md . He filed a federal lawsuit for compensation in 1979 , but was unsuccessful because of a legal doctrine that protects the military from being sued for service-related injuries . Schnurman and his wife , Joy , spent the next two decades compiling evidence of the testing in order to put pressure on the military .\nWhen the story broke , VA Deputy Secretary Anthony Principi appeared on 60 Minutes , in 1991 , to explain how the agency would respond to men who were injured in the tests : `` They should be praised for what they did , '' Principi said on the CBS News program . `` And as far as the secretary and I are concerned , we 're about to do right by them . ''\nMore than 20 years later , the VA has attempted to contact fewer than a quarter of the thousands it said it would .\nOne of the men who never heard from the VA was John Berzellini . His wife , Irene , remembers how the experiments affected his health for the rest of his life .\n`` I remember him laying up in the bedroom up there , '' she says .\nBerzellini says every winter her husband spent weeks in bed with chronic bronchitis \u2014 an illness government studies have linked to mustard gas exposure . She says they did n't know that he was eligible for disability benefits when he died of a heart attack in 1995 .\nIn the early 1990s , VA officials also announced the agency would lower its burden of proof to make getting benefits easier in these cases . The process typically relies on evidence , but most of the men in these experiments have none because the tests were done in secret .\n`` This is not an easy , not a simple thing , '' Flohr says . `` But we have done everything that we could do , I definitely believe that . ''\nThe VA created a list of illnesses that are linked to mustard gas exposure \u2014 such as skin cancer , leukemia and chronic breathing problems . According to the agency , if a veteran has an illness on the list and can prove he was exposed , he receives benefits .\nBut NPR interviewed veterans who met both of those requirements and have still been denied for years \u2014 sometimes decades \u2014 as the VA continues to request more information and proof .\nCavell says that even today , when he comes to a locked door he 's reminded of the inside of a gas chamber .\n`` There was no handle on the door . You could n't get out , '' he says . `` And that 's what I have problems with today . If I go to a locked door , I panic sometimes to try to get out . ''\nIn 1988 , Cavell requested copies of his records from the experiments he was in at the Naval Research Laboratory . Researchers there had recorded his full name in neat handwriting on lined paper . They had detailed the length of time he spent inside a gas chamber and the level of mustard gas in the air .\nCavell then submitted the documents to the VA as proof of his exposure . He filed claims for several illnesses on the VA 's list of those linked to mustard gas , including skin cancer and chronic breathing problems . But until NPR inquired about his case , all of those claims had been denied .\nAfter NPR 's inquiry , the VA told NPR there was enough evidence to grant his claims . They based that conclusion on the same information that had been sitting in his VA file for decades . Officials say they ca n't explain why the benefits were n't granted sooner . Cavell is currently being re-evaluated before the benefits can be disbursed .\nFormer CIA Director Porter Goss says the VA has mishandled these claims . Goss was a Florida congressman when he was contacted by a group of constituents who were used as test subjects and spoke out on their behalf . `` This should have been ancient history by now , '' he told NPR . `` And these people should have long been appropriately provided for . ''\nGoss says he thinks the VA never delivered on its promises because this issue has been disappearing on its own for years . About 500 World War II veterans die each day , according to data maintained by the VA. `` I do think there is a little bit of that attitude of : 'This is today 's problem , it will be gone by tomorrow , ' `` Goss says . `` But this is a bargain we made . And this goes to the essence of 'Can you trust your government ? ' And in this case I 'm afraid the answer is not yet . ''\nFlohr tells NPR his agency has followed federal statutes in its handling of claims for mustard gas exposure . But Goss says that excuse is at the core of all that is dysfunctional in Washington bureaucracies . `` I do n't think there 's an explanation for why this program was n't more successful , '' Goss says . `` If I were back in Congress , I 'd be asking that question . ''\nCongress has intervened in similar situations . It passed the Agent Orange Act in 1991 , which requires the VA to assume that all veterans who served in and around Vietnam were exposed to the chemical . And in 2010 , the VA announced it would review 90,000 previously denied Agent Orange claims . To date , these policies have not been applied to World War II vets who were exposed to mustard gas .\nOfficials at the Pentagon tell NPR it 's likely that some of the records about military mustard gas experiments were never recovered . And yet Flohr insists the VA still needs proof in order to grant claims .\n`` I 'm sorry , '' Flohr says . `` But the only thing we can do is follow our statutes and regulations . ''\nThose regulations have kept veterans like Harry Bollinger , 88 , from receiving benefits . Bollinger still has chronic breathing problems and breaks out in eczema in places where he was burned as a young Navy recruit :\n`` Around my privates and under my arms and face and everywhere else , '' he says .\nBollinger gave up appealing VA rejections in 1994 , after four years of traveling back and forth 30 miles to a VA office office in Pittsburgh . Then , in 1996 , Bollinger received a military commendation in the mail . The document acknowledges his participation in mustard gas experiments . But Bollinger says he would n't go back to the agency after the way he was treated there .\nA tattered ball cap that says World War II veteran hangs by the front door in his house . He says he is proud of his service , and he wears the cap everywhere he goes . But Bollinger says that time in his life is tainted : by the pain he felt as a human test subject in military experiments , and by the VA that told him it was n't real .\n`` That 's going to be on my tombstone , '' Bollinger says . `` U.S. Navy , Guinea Pig . That wo n't be too long now probably . ''\nNPR Investigations Research Librarian Barbara Van Woerkom contributed reporting and research to this investigation .

The VA is set to ban smoking at all its grounds nationwide starting Oct. 1 , a welcome move by health-conscious veterans but not by others who enjoy a smoke between appointments . ( AP Photo/Charles Krupa )\nCONCORD , N.H. ( AP ) \u2014 Serving up drinks at the American Legion post in Concord , Jeff Holland gets a little testy when the talk turns to smoking .\nA Marine veteran who enjoys lighting up , the 44-year-old Holland fought unsuccessfully against a ban at the post that went into effect this month . And starting Tuesday , he will be prohibited from smoking when he visits the nearby Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire .\nIt is part of a nationwide smoking ban outside all VA medical facilities that applies to visitors , patients and employees .\n\u201c I get the aspect that it \u2019 s a hospital and for all practical purposes you shouldn \u2019 t be smoking inside the VA , \u201d Holland said . \u201c But as far outside , I think they should still have a smoking area . I mean you got guys from World War I , World War II where this is all they have known for 40 or 50 years . To kind of take that right away , it \u2019 s kind of a shame . \u201d\nSmoking was already prohibited inside VA medical buildings , but now patients , employees and visitors will not be able to puff away anywhere on the grounds . Previously , smoking was allowed in designated shelters dotting the grounds of VA medical facilities . Posters and banners promoting the ban have been put up in facilities and the VA is alerting veterans through social media and letters . They have also held forums on the ban .\n\u201c This is a really good thing for our veterans and our staff , \u201d said Kevin Forrest , associate director of the Manchester VA , which serves 27,000 veterans . \u201c It \u2019 s a safer environment . It reduces fire risk . There is certainly evidence that smoking and second-hand exposure is a medical risk for our veterans . \u201d\nThe smoking ban was first announced this summer . It brings the facilities in line with bans already in place at 4,000 medical facilities and four national health care systems that have made their grounds smoke free .\nBut the move isn \u2019 t without controversy . A third of veterans smoke , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and many were introduced to the habit while serving . Tobacco has long been tied to military : Cigarette ads featured troops , and the culture of the service historically promoted smoking on the battlefield or as a welcome respite from the stress of combat .\n\u201c We recognize this is a difficult change for many folks , \u201d John D \u2019 Adamo , who is co-chairing the smoke-free implementation working group for VA Boston . It is gradually implementing the ban for the 62,000 veterans it serves over the coming months , including providing resources that could help veterans kick the habit . Violators will initially be warned of the policy and eventually VA police will enforce it .\n\u201c This is a major cultural change , \u201d he continued . \u201c It \u2019 s really been something often utilized for comradery , essentially a sense of community . \u201d\nBut even a gradual rollout is seen as too stringent for some smokers \u2014 and even some veterans who don \u2019 t smoke . They argue that there should be some place for smoking at VA facilities and fear that some veterans may choose cigarettes or cigars over visiting their VA doctors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going a little too far , \u201d Gregory d \u2019 Arbonne , president of the New Hampshire chapter of the Association of the United States Army . \u201c I \u2019 m against smoking , but there are people who smoke . When they do , they go outside and have this little smoking area . Now , what are they going to do ? \u201d\nJorg Dreusicke , a 72-year-old former smoker from New Hampshire who recruits members for the Veterans of Foreign Wars nationwide , called the move government overreach . He started smoking at the age of 10 and quit three years ago .\n\u201c It \u2019 s big brother telling people how to live , \u201d he said . \u201c Some people don \u2019 t mind because it doesn \u2019 t affect them . But for those it effects , they are pissed . \u201d\nHe predicted that after a \u201c period of revolt \u201d and much complaining , veterans would eventually return to medical centers .\nOthers are welcoming the ban , saying it is long overdue .\nTony Botticello , a 76-year-old Coast Guard veteran whose lung cancer is in remission , said he would often pass by smokers in parking lot on the way to his treatment at the Manchester VA . He smoked for over 50 years but quit smoking five years ago .\n\u201c It \u2019 s personal for me , \u201d he said . \u201c Maybe this will make somebody think about the ramifications of smoking and how some people find smoking offensive . \u201d", "Rescuers in Thailand on Monday freed four more members of the boys soccer team stranded in a flooded cave complex , as part of the second phase of a desperate rescue operation that aims to save four more kids and the team 's coach before heavy rains imperil the effort .\nFour ambulances with flashing lights were spotted leaving the area as Thai navy SEALs said on Facebook that four boys were brought out of the cave on Monday , bringing the total to eight rescued so far before rescue operations were suspended for the day .\nChiang Rai acting Gov . Narongsak Osatanakorn said at a news conference the rescue mission on Monday took only 9 hours compared to the 11 hours the previous day , adding that rescue crews are more familiar with the mission and additional help was present . A Thai army deputy commander added that the operation went `` smoothly '' but warned the next phase `` will depend on all conditions , '' according to Sky News .\nNarongsak said that rescuers , which included 18 divers and 100 personnel , may need to adjust their operation if they choose to bring out the remaining five people on Tuesday , and that it may take multiple steps .\nThai officials stressed they are hoping the rescue operation will be wrapped up by Tuesday , and that the four who were first pulled out of the cave on Sunday are eating solid food now and in `` good condition . ''\nThe newest set of rescues came about six hours after Chiang Rai acting Gov . Narongsak Osatanakorn said the second phase was underway . One helicopter carried the sixth and seventh boys to be rescued to a hospital , while the eighth boy was being transported on another helicopter for medical treatment .\n`` All conditions are still as good as they were yesterday , '' Narongsak told a news conference . `` The boys ' strength , the plan \u2014 today we are ready like before . And we will do it faster because we are afraid of the rain . ''\nOn Sunday , Thai navy SEALs successfully retrieved the first four members of the youth soccer team from the cave where they had been trapped for more than two weeks in the first rescue operation .\nInterior Minister Anupong Paojinda said early Monday the same group of expert divers who took part in Sunday 's rescue returned to extricate the others because they know the cave conditions and what to do . He said fresh air tanks needed to be laid along the underwater route , as officials continue to pump water out of the cave .\n'DO N'T BLAME YOURSELF , ' PARENT OF TRAPPED THAI YOUTH WRITES TO BOYS ' COACH\nReuters , citing an unnamed source at a nearby hospital , reported the boys \u2019 conditions were \u201c not bad \u201d but will continue to be monitored .\n`` This morning they said they were hungry and wanted to eat khao pad grapao , '' Narongsak said , according to the Associated Press , referring to a Thai dish of meat fried with chili and basil and served over rice .\nIt was not immediately clear Monday how the overnight rains had impacted water levels inside the flooded cave . Officials have said storms forecast for Chiang Rai province in Thailand 's far north had factored into their decision to go ahead with a complicated and dangerous plan to have the boys and their coach dive out of the cave . If everything goes to according to plan , the operation should be completed on Tuesday , officials previously told The Wall Street Journal .\nDR. MARC SIEGEL : BOYS RESCUED FROM THAI CAVE NOW FACE POSSIBLE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES\nNarongsak previously said experts told him flooding from new rain could shrink the unflooded space where the boys are sheltering to just 108 square feet .\n`` I confirm that we are at war with water and time from the first day up to today , '' he said . `` Finding the boys does n't mean we 've finished our mission . It is only a small battle we 've won , but the war has not ended . The war ends when we win all three battles \u2014 the battles to search , rescue and send them home . ''\nThe death Friday of a former Thai navy SEAL underscored the risks .

( Photo by Amarjeet Kumar Singh / SOPA Images/Sipa USA ) \u00a9 Sipa via AP Images\n( New York ) \u2013 Indian authorities should immediately drop politically-motivated charges against those peacefully protesting against citizenship policies that discriminate against Muslims and release them from custody , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said today .\nPolice have used draconian anti-terrorism , sedition , and other laws against students , activists , and other government critics , but have not acted against violence by supporters of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . In some cases , the police filed new charges after activists were granted bail to ensure that they remained in custody , placing them at further risk during the Covid-19 outbreak in overcrowded prisons with inadequate sanitation , hygiene , and access to medical care .\n\u201c The Indian authorities have used the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown to arrest activists , silence dissent , and deter future protests against discriminatory policies , \u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia director at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Instead of addressing past police abuse , the authorities seem to be trying their best to add to the list . \u201d\nIn December 2019 , the BJP-led government adopted the Citizenship Amendment Act , which for the first time in India makes religion a basis for citizenship . In response , protests broke out throughout the country following fears that the act , together with a planned nationwide verification process to identify \u201c illegal migrants , \u201d could threaten the citizenship rights of millions of Indian Muslims .\nViolence around the protests broke out in Delhi on February 24 , 2020 , leaving at least 53 people dead and hundreds injured , most of them Muslim . The police failed to respond adequately and were at times complicit in these attacks . The authorities have failed to conduct impartial and transparent investigations into the violence .\nWhile peaceful protests were dispersed after the government announced a lockdown in March 2020 to contain the spread of Covid-19 , the authorities have since started arresting protesters , including students and activists , and filing charges of sedition , murder , and terrorism under the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act ( UAPA ) , accusing them of a \u201c conspiracy \u201d to \u201c defame the country in the international arena . \u201d\nThose arrested include Meeran Haider , Safoora Zargar , Asif Iqbal Tanha , and Gulfisha Fatima , student activists ; Shifa-Ur-Rehman and Khalid Saifi , activists ; Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal , student activists from the feminist collective Pinjra Tod ; Tahir Hussain , a local political leader from Aam Aadmi Party ; and Ishrat Jahan , local leader from the opposition Congress party .\nZargar , arrested on April 10 for rioting , was granted bail three days later . But that day the police booked her under the UAPA and for murder and sedition . She was denied bail on those charges despite her being in the second trimester of pregnancy and having an underlying medical condition , two factors that could place her at heightened risk of complications if she were to contract Covid-19 .\nKalita and Narwal were granted bail after being arrested for rioting . In Kalita \u2019 s case , the magistrate noted that the police could not produce any concrete evidence to prove her role in the violence . However , the Delhi police immediately booked them on other charges , including sedition , murder , and under the UAPA , and they remain in jail .\nViolence broke out in Delhi on February 24 , soon after a local BJP politician , Kapil Mishra , demanded that the police clear the roads of protesters . Tensions had been building for weeks , with BJP leaders openly advocating violence against the protesters , portraying anyone who spoke out against the government as working against the country \u2019 s interests .\nClashes between BJP supporters and citizenship law protesters soon transformed into Hindu mobs rampaging through northeast Delhi , killing Muslims and damaging their homes , shops , mosques , and property . While several Hindus were also killed , including a policeman and a government official , Muslims overwhelmingly bore the brunt of the violence .\nActivists fear the police have overwhelmingly arrested Muslim residents from northeast Delhi neighborhoods where the violence took place in February , some of them victims of attacks , while failing to act against those responsible for the mob violence . The Delhi police have denied these allegations , saying the number of people arrested from the two communities are \u201c almost identical to each other , \u201d but have failed to disclose arrest details . The authorities have even provided contradictory information . In March , Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament that the violence was a \u201c well-planned conspiracy \u201d and that the police had filed over 700 cases , and detained 2,647 people . In a media briefing a day later , the Delhi police said that 200 people had been arrested . A month later , in reply to a Right to Information request , the Delhi police claimed that 48 people had been arrested . In May , a police spokesperson said that more than 1,300 people had been arrested in over 750 cases .\nIn several cases , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that the police did not follow procedures established under the criminal code such as producing an arrest warrant , informing the person \u2019 s family of the arrest , and providing them a copy of the First Information Report , the official police case , or ensuring that those arrested have access to legal counsel , including during interrogation .\nA lawyer reported that his 45-year-old client was accused of looting and burning a shop as part of a mob . On April 2 , when the man and his wife were not at home , several policemen barged into their house , searched it , and took their younger son to the police station . His son was released only when the man presented himself to the police , who detained him without telling him or his wife of his charges . His wife was given a copy of the First Information Report after 10 days . He was not able to meet or speak to his lawyer until he received bail over two months later .\nA 35-year-old man who was shot and injured during the violence in Delhi in February was detained without a warrant on April 7 , his lawyer said . His family went to three police stations to inquire about his whereabouts but were given no information . They were eventually informed that he had been arrested but were not given a copy of the First Information Report . His lawyer had to apply for his records through the courts and found out that he was charged with murder . He remains in jail .\nDue to the Covid-19 lockdown , those arrested have limited to no access to legal counsel or to family members . A 21-year-old man was arrested on April 7 on charges of rioting and arson . His lawyer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she is yet to meet her client : \u201c At the beginning of the lockdown , access to court records was a huge challenge . Generally , people being arrested were being sent into judicial remand without a lawyer present . I have had no contact with my client . Under normal circumstances , he would have been produced in court every 14 days and I would check on his health , have a conversation with him , move an application if he needs anything , but I can not do any of that now . \u201d\nActivists and students across the country , especially in BJP-ruled states , continue to be targeted for participating in anti-citizenship law protests . In Uttar Pradesh state , Farhan Zuberi , a student at Aligarh Muslim University , was arrested on charges of sedition , rioting , and attempted murder . Dr. Kafeel Khan was initially arrested for promoting enmity between groups for a speech during the protests , but after he received bail on February 11 , he was charged under the draconian National Security Act and kept in custody .\nIn Assam state , the police arrested several activists , charging some of them with sedition and under the UAPA . In January , Delhi police charged a university student , Sharjeel Imam , with sedition and he remains in jail . In February , Amulya Leona Noronha was arrested for sedition in Karnataka for raising the slogans for Pakistan and India unity at a protest but released on bail after over three months in detention because the authorities failed to file charges within the 90-day mandated time period .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 previously documented that the authorities responded to the largely peaceful protests in a partisan manner . In many cases , when BJP-affiliated groups attacked protesters , the police did not intervene .\nNor have the authorities taken any action against BJP leaders who incited violence against the protesters , calling to \u201c shoot \u201d them . The Delhi High Court , while hearing petitions about the violence in February , questioned the police decision to not file cases against BJP leaders advocating violence , saying it sent the wrong message and perpetuated impunity . The government \u2019 s attorney said that the situation was not \u201c conducive \u201d for registering complaints against BJP leaders .\nIndian authorities should uphold the rights to freedom of expression , association , and peaceful assembly , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said . The government should act to repeal or substantially revise the UAPA as well as repeal the colonial-era sedition law to end the abuses committed under these laws .\n\u201c Instead of locking up people who dare to speak out against discriminatory government policies , the authorities should listen to their legitimate fears and grievances , \u201d Ganguly said . \u201c The government has repeatedly said that minorities in India have nothing to fear , and the authorities should put actions to those words . \u201d", "Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli has said that Hindu deity Ram was born in the Himalayan nation and not India , as he accused New Delhi of `` encroaching on cultural facts '' amid frayed diplomatic relations between the two South Asian neighbours .\n`` We have been oppressed a bit culturally . Facts have been encroached , '' Oli said at a function at his residence in the capital , Kathmandu , on Monday , according to Nepali news website setopati.com .\nAccording to Hindu mythology , Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya town located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and married to Sita from Janakpur located in present-day Nepal .\nBut the 68-year-old leader claimed Ayodhya is a village to the west of the Nepali border town of Birgunj . He added that Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh , about 135km from state capital Lucknow , is a more recent creation of India 's .\nA demonstrator shouts slogans after being arrested in Kathmandu during a protest against India 's newly inaugurated link road [ Prakash Mathema/AFP ]\n`` We still believe that we gave Sita to Indian Prince Ram . But we gave to the prince from Ayodhya , not India . Ayodhya is a village a little west to Birgunj , not the Ayodhya created now , '' he was quoted as saying by setopati.com .\nIndia 's Hindu far-right believe Ram was born at the site of a medieval-era mosque . The Babri mosque was demolished by a Hindu mob in 1992 . Last year India 's Supreme Court gave the disputed land to Hindus to build a Ram Temple , asking Muslims to build a mosque far from the site .\nOn Tuesday , Nepal 's foreign ministry sought to clarify Oli 's comments .\n`` As there have been several myths and references about Shri Ram and the places associated with him , the prime minister was simply highlighting the importance of further studies and research of the vast cultural geography the Ramayana represents to obtain facts about Shri Ram , Ramayana and the various places linked to this rich civilization , '' the ministry said in a statement .\n`` The remarks were not meant to debasing the significance of Ayodhya and the cultural value it bears . ''\nThe Nepali prime minister has attacked India several times since a diplomatic row erupted on May 8 when New Delhi inaugurated a Himalayan road link passing through the disputed territory of Kalapani . Nepal opposes a controversial Indian map published last November that showed Kalapani in India .\nLast month , Nepal 's parliament approved a new political map , showing Kalapani , Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura within its borders , drawing strong reactions from India .\nOli has in the past accused New Delhi of conspiring to topple his government , and last week banned private Indian channels for `` character assassination '' and airing `` false propaganda '' .\nAnalysts say Oli 's tirade against India likely aims to divert attention from domestic political troubles . Senior leaders from his ruling National Communist Party ( NCP ) have been seeking his resignation over his leadership style and governance failure . He has also faced the ire of the people for his handling of the coronavirus crisis .\nThe Nepali prime minister has also accused India of spreading the coronavirus pandemic into his country .\nSenior NCP leaders have also criticised Oli 's anti-India remarks that were deemed `` neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate '' .\nA spokesman from India 's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has criticised Oli and accused the left parties of `` playing with peoples ' faith '' .\n`` Lord Ram is a matter of faith for us , and people will not allow anybody , be it prime minister of Nepal or anyone , to play with this , '' Bizay Sonkar Shastri told the Times of India newspaper .", "Thursday was a traditional Chinese holiday that follows a lunar calendar , and it coincidentally came right after the National Day holiday this year . As a result , many people had expected the rallies to remain just as large on Thursday as on Wednesday .\nDemonstrators were making a bigger effort by midmorning Thursday to minimize their disruption to commerce . Ken Lee , a 17-year-old hotel worker , sat on a gray plastic stool next to a row of safety cones \u2014 commandeered earlier from the police \u2014 that partly blocked the entrance to Queens Road , an important commercial street in Hong Kong . He explained that he was supposed to remove the cones not just for emergency vehicles that might come along , but also for delivery vehicles . Moments later , a newspaper deliveryman on a bicycle and a large bakery truck appeared . Mr. Lee politely moved the cones . The city \u2019 s leadership has concluded that it would be pointless for Mr. Leung to sit down with protest leaders , although a few informal contacts have been made with democracy advocates and a few of Mr. Leung \u2019 s friends have recommended negotiations . Beijing has given the Hong Kong government only a little room to negotiate the details of how the next chief executive will be elected in 2017 \u2014 the fundamental issue for the demonstrators .\n\u201c The government can tolerate the blockade of three or four or five areas and see how the demonstrations go , so the only way the demonstrators can go is to escalate it \u2014 spread it to more places , and then they can not sustain it \u2014 or they will become violent , \u201d said a person who is involved in the Hong Kong government \u2019 s decision-making .\nAn adviser to the government said the officials believed that Mr. Leung should bide his time . \u201c The consensus is to wait and patiently deal with the crisis \u2014 it is not easy , but we shall do our best to resolve it peacefully , \u201d the adviser said .\nThe strategy carries risks for the local and national governments because it in effect cedes momentum to the protesters and allows them to drive events . For China , continuing protests could inspire more dissent on the mainland , despite its censors \u2019 attempts to block discussion of the events . Chinese Human Rights Defenders , an advocacy group , said Wednesday that China had already detained or intimidated dozens of people for perceived transgressions like expressing support for the protesters on social media .\nFor the Hong Kong government , the risk is that the city \u2019 s image as a stable financial center will be harmed and that the government \u2019 s intransigence , rather than the protesters \u2019 actions , will be blamed for the disruption .", "India has seen a sudden increase in attacks on Christians as more people are circulating since the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted .\nAccording to International Christian Concern ( ICC ) , eight separate attacks have taken place in two weeks involving radical Hindu nationalist groups that are physically assaulting Christians and damaging their property .\nThe most recent incident occurred on June 21 where a pastor was praying for a sick person in Kolonguda village .\nA mob of 150 people broke into Pastor Suresh Rao 's house , then dragged him out and severely beat him .\n`` They kicked me like they would kick a football , '' Pastor Rao said . `` They dragged me into the street and pushed me to the ground . There , they started to trample on me . They tore my clothes , kicked me all over my body , and punched my left eye . I have sustained a serious eye injury as a result of a blood clot . ''\nThe pastor was accused of trying to convert Hindus to Christianity .\n`` They said that India is a Hindu nation , and there is no place for Christians , '' Rao explained .\n`` I am prepared for this kind of eventuality , '' Pastor Rao explained . `` I know the cost of serving Jesus in these remote villages , and I will continue to serve the people of this region . ''\nAnother incident took place in India 's Tamil Nadu state where a church was reduced to ashes , leaving 100 Christians with no house of worship .\n`` I was so distressed and pained in my heart , '' Pastor Ramesh , head pastor of Real Peace Church said . `` It was hard labor for 10 years to build the church .

''\n`` In the last ten years , I have been told numerous times by radicals to close the church . By God 's grace , I was able to endure all these hardships and abuses , but this time it is total devastation , '' the pastor added .\nAnd on June 13 , radicals threatened members of Laymen Evangelical Fellowship Church while they were setting up the church to reopen after being on lockdown .\nPastor Augustine said radicals were telling Christians that praying or gathering at church was forbidden and that Christians had caused the virus to spread .\n`` We do n't know what future holds , '' Pastor Augustine said . `` However , we are concerned that the radicals will not allow us to have a church service .

But he cited a controversial clean water rule as an example of a regulation that went too far .\nThe regulation \u2013 known as the Waters of the United States Rule and adopted by the Obama administration \u2013 expands the definition of waters subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA under the Clean Water Act .\nCritics charge the rule so broadly expands the federal government \u2019 s authority that it would be able to regulate ditches and small bodies of water . The EPA finalized the rule in May 2015 but it has been blocked by a federal appeals court pending further legal challenges .\nCongress voted last year to overturn the rule by invoking a rarely used law known as the Congressional Review Act .

''\nUnder his leadership , Pruitt said , the EPA would pay close attention to the rule-making process to ensure any new rules do not go beyond what is allowed under federal law .\n\u201c Executive agencies only have the power that Congress has given them , \u201d he said . \u201c They can \u2019 t make it up as they go .

How Obama 's team sold the EPA rule\nOnce again facing a big decision , President Barack Obama chose a familiar path : a walk around the South Lawn of the White House with chief of staff Denis McDonough .\nPodesta \u2019 s a runner , and he couldn \u2019 t look more like one . But he \u2019 s not used to meetings on the move\u2014even if this one was to discuss the progress on climate change , the issue he \u2019 s been trying to get more attention to for years and came back to the White House in January to lead .\nThe EPA \u2019 s proposed carbon emissions standards rule released Monday is one of the most significant actions the federal government \u2019 s ever taken on climate change . If finalized next year and put in place , it would be one of Obama \u2019 s largest legacy achievements .\nMaking sure that it didn \u2019 t seem like a big deal or all about Obama was all part of Podesta \u2019 s plan .\nInterviews with Podesta and other senior White House aides on Monday portrayed a White House that had been closely involved along every step of the way , from drafting the rule to the roll-out and messaging effort surrounding it .\nLap after lap that evening in mid-May , Podesta and McDonough talked the president through the proposed rule . He wanted to know how it squared with promises he had made in Copenhagen in 2009 , would hold up against the inevitable court challenges and how they \u2019 d attempted to balance the concerns of business , labor , Democrats and green groups so that everyone walked away not too disappointed and excited enough .\nLast week in the Oval Office , Obama signed off on the outreach and messaging strategy Podesta and climate adviser Dan Utech briefed him on . The president wanted all the groups they needed bought in . He wanted the White House to be ready with whatever rebuttals they \u2019 d need . And most of all , he wanted to minimize the prospects of this becoming yet another flashpoint .\n\u201c He wanted to know , \u201d Podesta said Monday evening , relaxed after a successfully calm roll-out day , \u201c \u2018 Okay , how are we prepared for battle here ? \u2019 \u201d\nObama had all day Monday for an event at the White House , or maybe in front of a power plant , running footage for the evening news of him announcing his plan to save the planet . Just last week , he \u2019 d talked to the graduating cadets at West Point about the likelihood that they \u2019 d have food riot duty in their futures . Instead , they had EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy make the announcement , keeping Obama to a conference call run by the American Lung Association .\n\u201c The idea was to modulate his involvement , \u201d said an administration official .\nFor seven minutes , Obama held forth on children \u2019 s asthma , which White House data showed was the most compelling angle they had \u2014 pointing out the disparate rates in the African-American and Latino community \u2014 with only a passing reference to taking care of \u201c this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space , \u201d just before he put down the phone .\nFor months , Podesta ran a strategy to seed support for the rule , planning a sequence of events to get people thinking about the administration \u2019 s efforts on climate change \u2014 a visit to the California wildfire damage in February , a solar summit at the White House in April , the National Climate Assessment in May ( complete with an afternoon of interviews by weathermen in the Rose Garden ) .\nThe effort , Podesta said , was \u201c try to tell a story to the American people so these individual actions didn \u2019 t come in a way that they didn \u2019 t understand what the overall strategy was . \u201d\nBy the time Hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012 , the Obama campaign was certain he was going to win . But looking out at the damage to the Jersey Shore from his helicopter , he talked , aides said , about how the area would need to rebuild in a totally different way \u2014 with climate change in mind .\nThe change that really mattered , though , was the amount of coverage the storm was getting \u2014 hitting the media capital helped \u2014 and the way the White House felt it resonating with people around the country . They don \u2019 t like to use the word opportunity to describe where they found themselves after Sandy , but that \u2019 s what this was .\n\u201c It was something he always knew he was going to come back to , \u201d said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri . \u201c But Sandy also put the connection between climate and weather and the impact it could have on the radar for Americans in a level to which prior to that it had not broken . \u201d\nClimate change hadn \u2019 t gone well for the White House in the first term \u2014 the House barely passed a cap-and-trade bill in 2009 that died in the Senate \u2014 but became yet another campaign issue that helped Republicans take the House and pick up Senate seats in the 2010 midterms .", "Agencies use loopholes to avoid transparency , the author writes . | John Shinkle/\u2588\u2588\u2588 How the EPA skirts transparency\nIt appeared to be the dawn of a new day when , in January 2009 , President Barack Obama proclaimed that his administration would be \u201c committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government . We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency , public participation and collaboration . \u201d\nBut more than four years later Americans continue to wait for the president to make good on those promises .\nInstead of more sunshine on how federal bureaucracies operate , agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have increasingly utilized regulatory loopholes to avoid transparency and pander to special interests .\nOne such Clinton-era tactic , known as \u201c sue and settle , \u201d is perhaps the most devious way in which agencies make sweeping policy changes , while keeping Congress and the American people in the dark .\nUnder this process , environmental groups and a federal agency agree to enter into a lawsuit that alleges that the agency has failed to meet a regulatory deadline or requirement . The two parties then settle with a preconceived consent decree that circumvents the traditional rule-making process and \u201c forces \u201d the agency to quickly implement mutually agreed-upon rules .\nIn a recently released report , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that EPA chose not to defend itself in lawsuits brought by special interest advocacy groups at least 60 times between 2009 and 2012 . As the Chamber notes , \u201c these settlements directly resulted in EPA agreeing to publish more than 100 new regulations , many of which impose compliance costs in the tens of millions and even billions of dollars . \u201d\nNot surprisingly , in each case , EPA settled on terms dictated by environmentalists \u2014 34 times with the Sierra Club alone \u2014 without input or review from Congress , stakeholders or even the Office of Management and Budget . In fact , EPA does not disclose that it is even being sued until the two parties have already struck a deal and that agreement is filed in court .\nWorse yet for taxpayers , the environmental groups \u2019 lawyers are paid directly out of federal coffers .\nThose fees also lack appropriate transparency . In 2012 , the Government Accountability Office reported that of the 75 agencies GAO contacted , a staggering 65 did not maintain records of why or what taxpayers were forking over for frivolous lawsuits .", "Over the past few days , the Environmental Protection Agency has been slapped with new media guidelines , expected to be hit with $ 800 million in budget cuts , and will have its current data on the agency \u2019 s website subject to political review . President Trump is reining in the agency , which was accused of overreach during the Obama presidency , specifically with its regulations on carbon emissions , power plants , and coal . The EPA is undergoing a facelift and some are not happy about it . ProPublica reported that EPA employees are coming into work in tears :\nSo far , Trump \u2019 s remodeling efforts have been both dramatic ( nominating Oklahoma attorney general and fossil-fuel ally Scott Pruitt to head the agency ) and quietly tactical ( freezing all EPA contracts and grants ) . [ \u2026 ] At EPA headquarters , the mood remains dark . A longtime career communications employee said in a phone interview Tuesday that more than a few friends were \u201c coming to work in tears \u201d each morning as they grappled with balancing the practical need to keep their jobs with their concerns for the issues they work on . To be sure , the EPA is an agency where information has been tightly controlled for many years , including under the Obama administration , which was harshly criticized by the Society of Environmental Journalists in 2013 for having \u201c taken secrecy to a new level. \u201d The EPA \u2019 s sheer size , with 10 regions and more than 14,000 employees , guarantees some level of confusion , as well . From headquarters through the regional offices , employees said they still hadn \u2019 t confirmed if a freeze on work under hundreds of existing contracts , described in a headquarters memo acquired on Monday by ProPublica , applied to vital actions like responding to spills .\nSo , while the details of the order regarding contracts are being clarified , let \u2019 s not forget that Middle America has been crying for the past eight years , as Obama \u2019 s war on coal has led to coal miners being laid off , which led to the destruction of local economies . So , spare me the sob stories from government bureaucrats .", "House Republicans approved deep spending cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency along with provisions to block the agency \u2019 s upcoming rule-making on Wednesday .\nThe House Interior and Environment appropriations bill would cut EPA funding by 9 percent next year and block several new rules the agency aims to put out this summer , including rule-making on water oversight and greenhouse gas emissions at power plants , The Hill epa-funding \u201d target= \u201d _blank \u201d > reported Wednesday .\nThe $ 20.2 billion funding bill for the Interior Department , EPA and other agencies will move to the full House Appropriations Committee for consideration .\nOverall , the bill cuts spending by $ 246 million from current levels and $ 3 billion below President Obama \u2019 s request .\nFunding for the EPA has decreased by 20 percent since Republicans took control of the House in 2011 .\nDemocrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee said they wouldn \u2019 t support the bill \u2019 s harsh cuts to the EPA .\n\u201c We are going backwards and the consequences will be felt in communities all across the country , \u201d Rep. Betty McCollum , a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the subcommittee , said at a Wednesday hearing , The Hill reported .\nBut Republicans on the committee argue that the agency \u2019 s rule-makings have gone to far and the cuts are needed to rein in an out-of-control environmental agenda .\n\u201c There is a great deal of concern over the number of regulatory actions being pursued by the EPA in the absence of legislation and without clear congressional action , \u201d said subcommittee chairman Rep. Ken Calvert , California Republican , The Hill reported .\nThe bill will now go to the full House Appropriations Committee for approval .\nCommittee chairman Rep. Hal Rogers , Kentucky Republican , whose state would be hurt by the EPA \u2019 s coal regulations , said that \u201c Congress must exercise its prerogative to prevent this kind of bureaucratic overreach , \u201d The Hill reported .", "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c The long-run structure of the American welfare state , which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly , requires a growing population and economy . Immigrants contribute to both goals \u2026 Going forward , demographers forecast that immigration \u2014 both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise \u2014 is the only reason America \u2019 s working-age population isn \u2019 t declining . This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants \u2019 work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans \u2019 childbearing as well\u2026 That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores \u2014 and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so \u2014 is an enormous source of national strength . It \u2019 s time we started to see it that way. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\n\u201c By signaling that the huddled masses are no longer welcome while others in the administration ( particularly Jared Kushner ) continue to advocate for the types of visas favored in Silicon Valley , Team Trump spins this as advocating not for \u2018 zero immigration , \u2019 but for the \u2018 right kind of immigration \u2019 \u2026 [ But ] \u2018 the president has made it more difficult\u2014and expensive\u2014to hire high-skilled tech workers from other countries . The administration has throttled a program that encouraged entrepreneurs to come to the U.S. It \u2019 s also ending work permits for spouses of H-1B holders , who are often highly skilled professionals themselves. \u2019 As a result of the administration \u2019 s efforts , there was a 10 percent decline in H-1Bs issued last year\u2026 It isn \u2019 t just about dissuading the tired and poor from coming , it \u2019 s about telling everyone to stay away . \u201d Alex Shephard , New Republic\n\u201c [ The rule ] won \u2019 t attract greater numbers of better-heeled , success-bound applicants . But it will radically slash the total number of immigrants gaining legal admission . And it will deprive the U.S. economy of badly needed workers of the sort who have a long track record of upward mobility\u2026 The fact remains that less-well-heeled immigrants fill jobs for which there are insufficient native-born applicants ; they perform well in those jobs and move up the income bracket . The administration \u2019 s new rules , while complex \u2014 they exempt pregnant women , asylum seekers , refugees , military service personnel and others \u2014 would drastically expand the pool of those who could be denied legal permanent residency based on poor predictors of future success. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c The Labor Department reports that seven million jobs are going unfilled even as the economy is slowing\u2026 Foreign-born workers include surgeons , computer engineers and financiers , and also those working in restaurant kitchens and driving cabs , doing the less desirable jobs at the lowest wages . But they contribute to the growth of the nation , and if some of them need help at some point with housing or food stamps , it \u2019 s a bargain in the long term . The economic return makes immigration a great investment for the nation . Which is why Mr. Trump \u2019 s public charge rule is bad for all Americans , not just those who strive to become one. \u201d Bill Saporito , New York Times\n\u201c Aside from the strong moral arguments against letting poor people go hungry and sick , no rational government would want immigrant communities to , for example , forgo vaccinating their children in order to avoid a punitive reaction from immigration authorities ; that has all the makings of a public health catastrophe . No rational government of a country with millions of immigrants would want millions of immigrant children to show up at school hungry each morning because their parents are afraid to apply for food stamps . No rational government would want hundreds of thousands of immigrant families to risk homelessness because of a temporary dip in their financial situation . Simply out of self-interest , a country such as the United States can not afford to drive millions of legal immigrants entirely outside the social safety net. \u201d Sasha Abramsky , The Nation\n\u201c Never mind that immigrants are , for one thing , less likely to rely on welfare benefits than native-born Americans\u2026 consider for a moment how many Americans -- our parents , grandparents , or great-grandparents -- would n't be here today if regulations that used the straitened circumstances of new immigrants to measure their future earning potential had been in place. \u201d Jill Filipovic , CNN\n\u201c The first comprehensive immigration law at the federal level was the 1882 Immigration Act , which , among other things , excluded anyone who was \u2018 unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge. \u2019 That principle \u2014 the \u2018 public-charge doctrine , \u2019 as it \u2019 s called \u2014 has been included in all subsequent immigration legislation , including the 1996 immigration and welfare-reform laws\u2026\n\u201c The Clinton administration issued guidance that barred consideration of anything other than cash benefits for purposes of determining self-sufficiency . In other words , an immigrant using food stamps , Medicaid , free school lunch , and public housing \u2014 but not cash benefits such as TANF or SSI \u2014 was to be considered self-supporting\u2026 Immigrants shouldn \u2019 t just use welfare less than the native-born \u2014 ideally , they shouldn \u2019 t use it at all . \u201d\n\u201c This approach is rooted in the common sense notion that immigrants should support themselves , not burden taxpayers . If they can \u2019 t support themselves , they should leave\u2026 However , the rule isn \u2019 t draconian . It applies to \u2018 an alien who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period. \u2019 Receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months . Thus , immigrants in dire straits can seek assistance of the types addressed in the new rule . Their status will be in jeopardy only if they remain on it for a year or more , total , during a three-year period . And even if they do , they won \u2019 t automatically be denied green cards . Other factors will be considered in assessing the likelihood that an immigrant who has used welfare extensively will be granted status . \u201d\nSome , however , argue \u201c there \u2019 s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding , and the DHS rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions\u2026 most immigrants don \u2019 t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years . Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a \u2018 public charge \u2019 based on arbitrary levels of income , employment , education and English proficiency\u2026\n\u201c While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute , DHS is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own . And wouldn \u2019 t you know , the rule bears a striking resemblance to the \u2018 merit-based \u2019 system that restrictionists in the White House have proposed but can \u2019 t get Congress to pass . If this sounds like Barack Obama \u2019 s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change , that \u2019 s because it is . \u201d\n\u201c Congress passed a law decades ago establishing that potential immigrants likely to become a \u2018 public charge \u2019 should not be permitted to enter the country . That makes some sense : A new resident should be able to add to , not detract from , the existing community \u2019 s economic resources . The problem is that Congress did not do its job and clearly establish when an aspiring immigrant meets or fails that test\u2026\n\u201c The rule announced on Monday is 837 pages long . It needed to address all the thorny issues Congress avoided and makes a roomful of contentious value judgments along the way\u2026 This is a problem inherent in what conservative lawyers call \u2018 the administrative state. \u2019 Congress passes laws that amount to mere statements of intent , avoiding the difficult choices that invite scrutiny and make enemies . It passes the buck to executive agencies , which then must make the value judgments and trade-offs via processes largely behind closed doors\u2026 Judicial oversight is no substitute for congressional abdication . Judges are not equipped to make the moral or technical judgments such laws in all but name require . \u201d\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t about race\u2026 the story of immigration to the United States has always been about people of every race , color and creed who come here to work and take advantage of American freedoms and opportunity \u2014 not a desire to take advantage of the welfare state\u2026 Even if you don \u2019 t share administration hard-liners \u2019 desire to cut back legal immigration , \u00ademphasizing merit is a common-sense concern that is supported by most Americans . Our culture is rooted in self-sufficiency and individual initiative . Our immigration system should reflect our national creed . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d", "On Tuesday , Maine Gov . Paul LePage ( R ) released data on purchases made with state welfare benefits that he claimed exposed abuse , but they only add up to less than a percent of all benefit transactions .\nThe data show that there were more than 3,000 transactions at bars , sports bars , and strip clubs made with EBT ( electronic benefit transfer ) cards loaded with TANF ( Temporary Assistance for Needy Families , or welfare ) and food stamp benefits between January 1 , 2011 and November 15 , 2013 . The state doesn \u2019 t track what was actually purchased , and some transactions can be withdrawals from ATMs at those locations . Given that there are about 50,000 of these transactions every month , or nearly 1.8 million in that time frame , as the state \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) spokesman told the Bangor Daily News , they only make up \u201c about two-tenths of 1 percent of total purchases and ATM withdrawals , \u201d the paper calculates .\nLePage still expressed outrage at this tiny fraction of purchases . \u201c This information is eye-opening and indicates a larger problem than initially thought , \u201d he wrote when the data was released . \u201c These benefits are supposed to help families , children and our most vulnerable Mainers . Instead , we have discovered welfare benefits are paying for alcohol , cigarettes and other things that hardworking taxpayers should not be footing the bill for. \u201d When the Bangor Daily News asked his spokeswoman about the small number of transactions , she responded , \u201c Any amount of abuse in the system that takes away from the truly needy needs to be dealt with , \u201d adding , \u201c We \u2019 re not uncovering anything new . There are always going to be bad actors out there . We \u2019 re simply saying , \u2018 We \u2019 ve got an eye on you . \u2019 \u201d\nHis spokeswoman also said that he will sponsor a bill to address issues with welfare benefits during this year \u2019 s session , including the fact that the state doesn \u2019 t track what recipients buy .\nIf LePage is seeking to paint welfare recipients as wasteful spenders who blow their money on alcohol and cigarettes , the data are not on his side . Nationally , those who receive public benefits such as welfare cash assistance , food stamps , housing assistance , Medicaid , and others spend a bigger portion of their budgets on basics like food , housing , and transportation than those who aren \u2019 t enrolled in these programs . They also spend less on eating out and entertainment . Overall , families who rely on government programs spend less than half of what families who don \u2019 t rely on them spend .\nLePage has made other controversial statements and decisions when it comes to the poor or less fortunate residents of his state . He claimed that 47 percent of Mainers don \u2019 t work , despite the fact that 65 percent are working or actively seeking a job while the remaining percentage is mostly made up of retirees , the disabled , students , and homemakers . He exhorted all able-bodied residents to \u201c get off the couch and get yourself a job \u201d in 2012 despite high unemployment rates and few job openings . After he pushed for a five-year cap on welfare benefits , more than 1,500 families with an estimated 2,700 children lost the assistance . Even his plan to simply relocate the state \u2019 s DHHS office was controversial , as he wants to move it from downtown Portland to a location in South Portland that is difficult to reach and could restrict the poor \u2019 s access to social services .", "The federal government is about to put $ 100 million behind a simple idea : doubling the value of SNAP benefits \u2014 what used to be called food stamps \u2014 when people use them to buy local fruits and vegetables .\nThis idea did not start on Capitol Hill . It began as a local innovation at a few farmers ' markets . But it proved remarkably popular and spread across the country .\n`` It 's so simple , but it has such profound effects both for SNAP recipients and for local farmers , '' says Mike Appell , a vegetable farmer who sells his produce at a market in Tulsa , Okla .\nThe idea first surfaced in 2005 among workers at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . They were starting a campaign to get people to eat more fresh produce .\n`` I think we were trying to confront the idea that healthy foods , [ like ] fresh fruits and vegetables , are not affordable , '' says Candace Young , who was director of the department 's nutrition programming at the time . ( Young now works for The Food Trust in Philadelphia . )\nYoung recalls that one of their workers pointed out that some SNAP recipients live near farmers markets `` and we thought , how about we incentivize them to use their SNAP benefits at these farmers markets ? ''\nThe city made a few thousand dollars available for the program . So at a few markets in the South Bronx and Harlem , when someone spent $ 10 of SNAP benefits , he then received an additional $ 4 in the form of coupons called HealthBucks , which could be used to buy more local produce .\nThis desire to make farmers markets more food-stamp friendly seems to have been floating in the air at that time . A farmers market in Lynn , Mass. , used a $ 500 donation to do something similar the very next year .\nThen , in 2007 , the idea mutated into a form that really caught on .\nIt happened with the birth of the Crossroads Farmers Market , on the boundary that divides the towns of Langley Park and Takoma Park , Md . The area , just outside Washington , D.C. , is home to many immigrants .\n`` A lot of Latinos come to this market , '' says Michelle Dudley , the market manager . `` I would say that 70 percent of our customers are Spanish-speaking , but we also see people from the Caribbean . Folks from West Africa . ''\nBack in 2007 , a man named John Hyde organized the Crossroads market with this immigrant community in mind `` and then realized \u2014 these people did not have a lot of money , '' says Gus Schumacher , Hyde 's friend and collaborator at the time . ( Hyde ca n't tell the story himself , unfortunately . He died in 2009 . )\nSchumacher says he and Hyde got to talking about this money problem and had a brainstorm : If they could raise some money , they could use it to double the value of food stamps , as well as vouchers from the WIC ( Women , Infants , and Children ) program and food benefits for seniors .\nSchumacher , a former top official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture , used his connections to raise the money . `` I asked the National Watermelon Association if they would provide a small stipend , and they were very generous . They provided $ 5,000 , '' he says .\nThey set up a system that has remained almost unchanged ever since . On a recent visit , I see SNAP recipients lining up to speak with a market volunteer named Rosie Sanchez . They tell her how much money they want to spend from their SNAP benefits . Sanchez swipes their SNAP card and gives them wooden tokens that they can spend at the market . But she actually gives them tokens worth twice the amount that she took from their SNAP benefits ; up to $ 15 more .\nSanchez is a SNAP recipient herself . This program `` is very important , '' she says . `` You know why ? Because I get up to $ 15 for free . So I have $ 30 every week . With my $ 30 , I 'm able to buy fresh , local \u2014 it 's not expensive . It 's the best ! ''\nGus Schumacher loved it , too . The same year this market started , he co-founded , together with chef Michel Nischan , an organization called Wholesome Wave , which has brought this idea of doubling SNAP benefits to farmers markets from Connecticut to California .\nPrivate foundations were happy to contribute , because they realized that their dollars could do several things at once : ease poverty , promote better health and boost the local farm economy .\nIn Michigan , food activist Oran Hesterman set up the Fair Food Network , which called this idea Double Up Food Bucks and got it working in more than 100 places across the state .\n`` We wanted to take it from the seed of an idea to a demonstration that this is something that you could do at scale , '' Hesterman says .\nHesterman was thinking big . He wanted to sell this idea to the government .\nHe invited one of Michigan 's senators \u2014 Democrat Debbie Stabenow \u2014 to see Double Up Food Bucks for herself . And last year , Stabenow , who is chairwoman of the Senate 's Agriculture Committee , proposed including it in the so-called farm bill .\nOn the other side of Capitol Hill , the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee , Republican Frank Lucas , from Oklahoma , was hearing about this idea , too .\nFarmer Appell had brought Double Up Food Bucks to the Cherry Street Farmers Market in Tulsa and talked about it to a member of Lucas ' staff .\n`` It did n't seem like it required much of a sell , '' Appell recalls . `` They seemed to be on board with it . '' If the program was supporting farmers , the congressman wanted to support it .\nEarlier this year , the farm bill passed , and it included $ 100 million , over the next five years , to boost SNAP dollars when they 're spent on fresh fruits and vegetables . Those taxpayer dollars have to be matched by private funding , so the program could add up to $ 200 million in total .\nThat 's a huge increase . According to some estimates , it may be 10 times what these programs spend right now .\nAs a result , small programs like the Cherry Street Farmers Market and the Crossroads market are now applying for funding to expand . And Michigan 's Fair Food Network , one of the biggest programs , is even moving beyond farmers markets . It 's now working with supermarket chains to see whether SNAP recipients shopping there can double their dollars for fresh produce every day and all year round .", "There may be a glimmer of hope for the Millennial Generation\u2013my generation\u2013 when it comes to attitudes about government and the welfare state . In 2008 , young Americans got drunk on Barack Obama . I mean , insanely drunk over Mr. Hope and Change , who bamboozled them not once , but twice . So , it should come as no surprise that after Obamacare \u2019 s disastrous rollout and the president \u2019 s ineffectiveness as a leader that a majority of young Americans would support recalling him from office .\nOuch ! But , so what if they agree to this ? They 're still hopelessly liberal on everything , right ? Emily Ekins at Reason says not so much , especially once millennials become employed and , you know , start making money :\nMillennials also become more fiscally conservative as they age , make more money , and learn they will become responsible for paying for things . In fact majorities begin to oppose income redistribution and increased spending on financial assistance to the poor , and support for government guarantees drops once millennials start making between $ 40K-60K a year . Moreover , as they roll off their parents ' health insurance policies and begin paying for their own , they no longer are willing to pay more for insurance even `` if it helped provide health insurance coverage for the uninsured , '' flipping from 57 percent in support to 59 percent opposed .\nWhen it comes to Social Security , 71 percent of millennials support creating private accounts :\nSimilarly , Pew found 67 percent of all Americans also favor allowing younger workers invest in private accounts . However , if allowing younger workers to opt out of Social Security meant reduced benefits to seniors , only 38 percent of all Americans would favor while 55 would oppose , according to Reason-Rupe . Millennials \u2019 willingness to cut entitlements simply doesn \u2019 t comport with strong economic liberalism .\nAs for health care , 54 percent of millennials believe that government should ensure access , but Ekins noted \u201c GenX was also more supportive when they were in their 20s and have since changed . \u201d\nYou can read the rest of Reason \u2019 s report on millennials here .\nAlthough , while millennials might go the way of the generations before them , they \u2019 re largely \u201c unclaimed. \u201d While Republicans \u2019 espousing of social conservatism might turn them off , the GOP \u2019 s advocacy for free markets and economic independence might be a magnet . Yet , they \u2019 re unsure if such a system is the best for social mobility , according to the report . That \u2019 s an area conservatives can surely win , but only if we make the argument . Demography isn \u2019 t destiny\u2013and it seems the notion of young Americans being lost to liberalism is a bit premature .\nAfter all , the majority of 18-year-olds voted for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election .\nI double-checked this and found a Washington Post article from March 10 that touched upon this , saying Democrats have a young people problem as well :\nAmong self-reported voters who were 18 years old in 2012 , Mitt Romney , not Obama , won the majority : 57 percent . Romney also won 59 percent among 19-year-olds , and 54 percent among 20-year-olds . These youngest voters of 2012 had entered the electorate in 2010-2012 , when Obama \u2019 s popularity was much lower than the high point of his inauguration .\nIn other words , they saw the Obama agenda in action .\nRepublicans have an inroad ; let 's see if they take advantage of it .", "UPDATE : United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli outlined the details of the new rule from the White House briefing room Monday morning , citing his own immigrant family from Italy .\nThe new rule does not affect asylum seekers , refugees , pregnant women , mortgage loans or students loans . Food stamps , cash assistance and other welfare will count as a negative on applications to become legal permanent residents . Likelihood of welfare use , current use or past use will only serve as one negative factor as applications are considered . A totality of other factors , like age and employment , will also be considered before a green card is issued .\nThe rule will go into affect on October 15 , 2019 and applications for green cards will not consider the new requirements while evaluating eligibility until that date . Applications submitted before October 15 will not be subject to the additional scrutiny .\n`` This is an implementation of a law passed by Congress in 1996 ... on a bipartisan basis , '' Cuccinelli said . `` Our rule generally prevents aliens who are likely to become a public charge from coming to the United States or remaining here and getting a green card . ''\n`` Through the public charge rule , President Trump 's administration is re-enforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility ensuring immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America , '' he continued .\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli will announce from the White House Monday morning new enforcement measures that will make it more difficult for immigrants to obtain green cards if they are likely to sign up for welfare benefits .\n`` Public charge has been a part of our immigration law since the 1880s . Self-sufficiency has been a core tenet of the American dream . Self-reliance , industriousness , and perseverance laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of hardworking immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States ever since , '' a USCIS official released Monday morning . `` President Trump is fulfilling his promise to the American people to fix our immigration system and is defining this important law that will protect American taxpayers and prevent abuse of government benefits . ''\nCuccinelli will argue the Trump administration is simply enforcing long standing and existing laws .\n`` Generations of Americans and hardworking legal immigrants have worked hard to meet their needs \u2013 they didn \u2019 t rely on the government , '' a background document says . `` For more than a century , our process of admissibility into the country has emphasized the need for self-sufficiency . ''\nThe move is being made to cut down on fraud , abuse and to protect resources provided by the American taxpayer .\nDHS is revising its interpretation of \u201c public charge \u201d to incorporate consideration of such benefits , and to better ensure that aliens subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground are self-sufficient , i.e. , do not depend on public resources to meet their needs , butrather rely on their own capabilities , as well as the resources of family members , sponsors , and private organizations.10This rule redefines the term \u201c public charge \u201d to mean an alien who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period ( such that , for instance , receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months ) . This rule defines theterm \u201c public benefit \u201d toinclude cash benefits for income maintenance , SNAP , most forms of Medicaid , Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher ( HCV ) Program , Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance , and certain other forms of subsidized housing . DHS has tailored the rule to limit its effects in certain ways , such as for active duty military members and their families , and children in certain contexts .\nCheck back for more information after Cuccinelli 's press conference , which will take place at 10 am ET .", "USDA rule would cut food stamp benefits for 3.1 million About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration 's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program .\nAbout 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration 's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program .\nThe Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close `` a loophole '' that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets .\n`` For too long , this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines . Too often , states have misused this flexibility without restraint , '' Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement .\nThe proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration 's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP , the official name of the food stamp program . It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance .\nUSDA estimates that 1.7 million households \u2014 3.1 million people \u2014 `` will not otherwise meet SNAP 's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule . '' That would result in a net savings of about $ 9.4 billion over five years .\nAn unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact , saying it `` may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility . ''\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was `` the administration 's latest act of staggering callousness '' while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would `` fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality . ''\nSen. Debbie Stabenow , D-Mich. , said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to `` take food away from families , prevent children from getting school meals , and make it harder for states to administer food assistance . ''\nCongress has rejected previous , similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions , most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018 .\nRobert Greenstein , president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program .\n`` The proposed rule would weaken SNAP 's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs , '' he said .\nAbout 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019 , down from more than 38 million a year earlier .\nUnder current law , states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps , if they meet income and other requirements for TANF . USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says `` barely participate '' in TANF . The provision is called `` expanded categorical eligibility . ''\nUSDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who do n't need it and would n't qualify under regular program rules .\nEllen Vollinger , legal director of the Food Research & Action Center , said the proposal was troubling and that the government should `` put attention on how to help more people , not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder . ''\nShe said the department did n't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals , which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous , similar proposals . `` It 's another hit on hunger , '' she said .\nUnder the proposal , to qualify for automatic eligibility , people would have to get at least $ 50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months .\nPerdue said the change is necessary for `` preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it . ''\nThe rule , expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday , is open for public comment for 60 days .", "A disturbed man with an AR-15-style rifle walked through a popular historic site in 1996 , shooting up the cafe and gift shop . He left 35 people dead and 19 seriously injured .\nThe country \u2019 s conservative leader pushed through immediate , sweeping changes to gun laws . Chief among them was a ban and mandatory buyback of more than 600,000 semiautomatic rifles and other long guns , which were then melted down . In all , one researcher estimates , the government ultimately destroyed about a million weapons \u2013 roughly one-third of its total gun stock .\nThat was in Australia , a country that has not had another large-casualty mass shooting since . Officials repeatedly ask : why can \u2019 t America do the same ?\n\u201c We know that other countries , in response to one mass shooting , have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings . Friends of ours , allies of ours \u2013 Great Britain , Australia , \u201d Barack Obama said last year after a mass shooting at a college in Oregon .\n\u201c Certainly the Australia example is worth looking at , \u201d Hillary Clinton said that same month .\nIn an attack on America \u2019 s political inaction last week , comedian Samantha Bee asked why one city after another had to have its \u201c turn \u201d witnessing a mass shooting . In Australia , she said : \u201c Parliament passed strict gun laws and they haven \u2019 t had a mass shooting since then . \u201d\nOne reason America can \u2019 t emulate Australia is purely political : American gun rights advocates say this kind of confiscation would prompt \u201c a civil war \u201d .\n\u201c It \u2019 s confiscation of private property and the threat of jail , and that \u2019 s not the American way , \u201d said Philip Alpers , a gun violence researcher at the University of Sydney .\nBut there are other reasons that Australia is not a good model for how the US can address gun violence . As part of a Guardian examination of what it might take to break the cycle of the American gun control debate , we looked first at how parents of children killed at Sandy Hook elementary school are trying to move the conversation forward \u2013 in part , by fighting for laws that would not have saved their children . Today , we \u2019 re looking more deeply at the reality behind America \u2019 s gun casualty numbers \u2013 and why allowing mass shootings to define the debate may get in the way of saving lives .\nCan the US break its cycle of gun control failure ? Read more\nAmerica \u2019 s gun problem is dramatically larger in scale than Australia \u2019 s was\nIn the US , more than 10,000 Americans will likely be killed in gun murders this year . Another 20,000 will likely be lost to gun suicide . The total number of gun deaths and violent injuries will be close to 100,000 .\nEven before the \u201c big melt \u201d , as one Australian gun researcher put it , Australia \u2019 s per capita rate of gun homicide was much lower than America \u2019 s . Handguns were already strictly regulated .\nIn 1995 , before it implemented sweeping gun buybacks , Australia saw 67 gun murders , fewer than last year \u2019 s total murders in Oklahoma City . After Australia \u2019 s buyback of nearly a million guns , at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars , the nation \u2019 s gun murders dropped by nearly half , from 67 to about 30 gun murders per year . Researchers are still debating how much of that drop was attributable to the new gun control policies , since gun murders were already trending down .\nThe US also has a dramatically larger number of guns . For the US to collect and destroy the same proportion of firearms that Australia did it would require a buyback of 90m firearms , according to a leading Australian researcher , at a cost that might be in the billions if the US paid fair market value for the weapons .\nThe US doesn \u2019 t just have a mass shooting problem \u2013 it has an enormous , multifaceted gun violence problem\nMass shootings are a growing and alarming phenomenon in the US . By a purely numerical count , the United States has seen more than 1,000 mass shootings in 1,260 days . By a stricter definition , the number is smaller but still sobering : 19 public mass shootings since the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in December 2012 .\nBut by any definition , they make up only a tiny percentage of the overall toll of gun deaths .\nThe US could end all mass shootings today and its rates of gun violence would still be many times higher than other rich countries .\nMuch of America \u2019 s day-to-day gun violence is concentrated in America \u2019 s poorest , most racially segregated neighborhoods \u2013 places with high rates of unemployment , struggling school systems , and high levels of mistrust between police officers and community members .\nAfrican Americans , who represent 13 % of the total population , make up more than half of overall gun murder victims . Roughly 15 of the 30 Americans murdered with guns each day are black men .\nGun violence in America , as criminologist Frank Zimring put it , is another regressive tax on the poor . Some black neighborhoods have experienced so much violence that their residents report symptoms of post-traumatic stress at rates comparable to veterans of war .\nBecause everyday gun violence is concentrated in racially segregated neighborhoods , it \u2019 s easy for millions of Americans to think they won \u2019 t be affected .\n\u201c As soon as it \u2019 s anybody \u2019 s kindergartener that can be at risk , we \u2019 re a hell of a lot more terrified , because there is no social class or geographic address that makes one exempt , \u201d Zimring said .\nAmerica \u2019 s gun control debate continues to revolve around the exact circumstances of the shooting that is currently on the news . Is a new gun law worth it , or not ? That depends on whether it might have prevented this particular shooting . While this is an understandable , human response , it is a terrible way to go about saving lives .\nThe shock and horror that follows mass shootings has led to an obsessive focus on the dangers of military-style rifles \u2013 even though rifles of any kind were used in less than 3 % of gun murders in 2014 , according to FBI data .\nA tunnel focus on mass shootings has also fueled the public perception that mental illness is driving gun violence . But experts caution that even miraculously curing all schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and major depression in American might only lead to a 4 % reduction in overall violence .\nA debate conducted in the aftermath of mass shootings has also prompted a huge public investment in guarding and fortifying public schools against shootings , even though the typical school can expect to see a student homicide only once every 6,000 years , according to safety expert Dewey Cornell .\nSince the 1999 school shooting at Columbine high school in Colorado , the justice department has invested nearly $ 1bn to help put police officers in schools , though Cornell notes there is still little evidence that school security measures reduce crime .\nThe political focus on mass shootings sometimes even undermines policies that are aimed at addressing the big picture of violence . Opponents of universal background checks have sought to undermine Democrats \u2019 push for the reform by pointing out that mass shooters \u2019 murder weapons are often purchased legally . But that \u2019 s not the point . Expanding background checks on private sales of guns is a strategy designed to help crack down on the illicit market in guns used in everyday gun violence .\nA gun debate driven by focus on the most high-profile killings also plays into the hand of the National Rifle Association , whose leaders argued this weekend that tough gun control laws in Europe did not prevent the terrorists in Paris from getting guns .\nThat may be true . But the United States \u2019 overall gun homicide rate is roughly 16 times higher than in France , according to statistics from the FBI and Gunpolicy.org .\nTo save the greatest number of lives , it \u2019 s the everyday violence \u2013 not just the mass shootings \u2013 that we need to prevent .", "Today , conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh was interviewed by Fox News ' Chris Wallace regarding the horrific massacre that occurred last week at the hands of gunman Nikolas Cruz . That shooting which occurred at a High School in Parkland , FL left 17 dead and many more injured . In the wake of the tragedy , thousands have called for more gun control and and mental health measures to prevent the next shooting . But , Limbaugh argued that none of the proposed ideas will actually stop the next shooting and America must protect its students by arming our teachers in preparation for the next tragedy .\n`` What I found very interesting about the students , and they \u2019 re very articulate and you have to feel for them . It \u2019 s wrecked their lives , they are a combination of scared and angry . But , Chris , I have to ask if anybody is really serious about solving this ? , '' Limbaugh told the host of Fox News Sunday .\n`` Cause of none of this , and by the way I couldn \u2019 t care less about the angle of this , because none of this , is going to solve it . Prayers and condolences don \u2019 t solve it . And marches don \u2019 t solve it , '' he claimed .\nThen , Limbaugh warned the audience of the very real threat the next mass shooter is out there amongst t the public , gun in hand , saying , `` Chris , the next shooter is out there . The next shooter probably has the gun that he is going to use . The next shooter is known by many people in his community who are concerned that this guy may do what everybody is afraid he is going to do . Now how is anything that we are talking about going to stop that ? ''\n`` We have got to realize this is what our country has become.We can wish that it weren \u2019 t it this way and we can wish that Congress can legislate it away , but they ca n't . It 's not the fault of the NRA , it \u2019 s not the fault of the NRA . It 's the fault of the people doing this , our inability of dealing with that , and stopping them . We have armed security at virtually every public entity except schools . For some reason the are a gun free zone and everybody who wants to shoot up a school knows they are going to be armed , '' he added .\nThe ultimate solution , he says , is arming teachers to protect students in schools . \u201c The solution is we need concealed carry in these schools . If we are really serious about protecting the kids , we need a mechanism to be defensive when this kind of thing \u2014 if we \u2019 re not going to take action , we better have mechanisms in these schools to stop it when it breaks out . \u201d\nLimbaugh also blamed the media for politicizing these events rather than working to find actual solutions .", "The idea that gun-control advocates do n't want to confiscate your weapons is , of course , laughable . They ca n't confiscate your weapons , so they support whatever feasible incremental steps inch further toward that goal . Some folks are more considerate and get right to the point .\n`` I have never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment , '' writes The New York Times ' new-ish conservative columnist Bret Stephens . Referring as a fetish to an inalienable right that has a longer and deeper history among English-speaking people than the right to free speech or the right to freedom of religion is an excellent indicator that someone probably has n't given the issue serious thought .\nI mean , Stephens is n't contending Americans should n't own five AR-15s . He 's arguing that the state should be able to come to your house and take away your revolver or your shotgun or even your matchlock musket .\n`` From a law-and-order standpoint , more guns means more murder , '' writes Stephens , before pulling a narrowly catered statistic that ignores the vast evidence that the number of guns does not correlate with the murder or the crime rates . What studies often do is conflate gun homicides and suicides . If Stephens wants to argue that confiscation would lead to fewer suicides , he 's free to do so . But he 's also going to have to explain why countries with the highest suicide rates often have the strictest gun control laws . The fact is that despite a recent uptick in crime , since 1990 , the murder rate has precipitously dropped\u2014including in most big urban centers\u2014while there was a big spike in gun ownership .\nThen Stephens compares justifiable gun homicides\u2014shooting a felon while protecting one 's home , etc.\u2014with unintentional homicides with a gun . After some back-of-the-napkin calculation , Stephens concludes that guns are useless as a means of personal protection . Anyone who 's spent 10 minutes thinking about gun control understands there is no way to quantify how many criminals are deterred by the presence of guns , or how many , for that matter , are turned away in the midst of crime . Has anyone calculated how many non-gun-owning families are safer because their neighbors own firearms ?\nWithout getting into the practicality of confiscating more than 300 million guns , it seems odd that someone would let murderers and madmen decide what inalienable rights we should embrace . It is almost humorous to hear someone advising you not to worry about domestic tyranny as he explains why the state should eradicate a constitutional right and confiscate your means of self-defense . But Stephens comes to the likely true conclusion that you ca n't stop random men from killing .\nTo his credit , Stephens refrains from comparing random madmen with those who kill in the name of a worldwide ideological movement that relies on terrorism as a political weapon . Though we can often do something to detect the latter , the FBI would not have stopped `` Mohammad Paddock , '' in the same way they did n't stop Syed Rizwan Farook or Tashfeen Malik or Nidal Hasan or Omar Mateen .\nBut my favorite part of Stephens ' column is when he asks : `` I wonder what Madison would have to say about that today , when more than twice as many Americans perished last year at the hands of their fellows as died in battle during the entire Revolutionary War . ''\nSetting aside the population scale , Stephens might not know that one of the reasons the Federalists , including Madison , opposed the Second Amendment was that they believed concerns over protections from the federal government were overblown because there were so many guns in private hands that it was unimaginable any tyrannical army could ever be more powerful than the general public . Others , like Noah Webster , reasoned , `` The supreme power in America can not enforce unjust laws by the sword ; because the whole body of the people are armed , and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be , on any pretense , raised in the United States . ''\n`` Repealing the Amendment may seem like political Mission Impossible today , '' writes Stephens , `` but in the era of same-sex marriage it 's worth recalling that most great causes begin as improbable ones . ''\nTo troglodytes like myself , the writing of the Constitution and Bill of Rights was perhaps the greatest cause of the nation . Moreover , same-sex marriage was instituted by the courts . Repealing the Second Amendment is going to take a lot more heavy lifting . There are probably too many fetishists around to make it happen .\nI 'm one , too . As an American and a Jew descended from people who came here escaping both Nazism and communism , I 'm OK with fetishizing the Second Amendment . As a person who can read history and contrast the 19th- and 20th-century history of America and Europe\u2014and about anywhere else\u2014I `` get '' the fetish . And when I read columns like the one Stephens wrote , I definitely get it .", "Story highlights President Obama says gun law foes `` willfully lied ''\nMajor components of Obama 's gun proposals fail to win Senate approval\nSupporters of new gun laws blame the defeats on NRA influence in Congress\nIn a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws , the U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons .\nThe votes were on a series of amendments to a broad package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December .\nHowever , fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package , even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents .\nAfter the votes , Obama angrily criticized the NRA and senators who voted against the expanded background checks for rejecting a compromise he said was supported by a strong majority of Americans .\n`` Instead of supporting this compromise , the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill , '' Obama told White House reporters .\nJUST WATCHED Obama angry about gun bill failure Replay More Videos ...

''\nHe was flanked by relatives of gun violence victims as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , a gun owner who was disabled in a shooting attack and supported Obama 's proposals .\nA statement by Giffords and her husband , former astronaut Mark Kelly , said the Senate had `` ignored the will of the American people , '' adding that those senators who voted against the expanded background checks chose to `` obey the leaders of the powerful corporate gun lobby , instead of their constituents . ''\nTo Erica Lafferty , the daughter of the principal of the Newtown , Connecticut , school who was killed along with 20 first-graders and five other educators in the December attack , the vote amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy .\n`` The next time there 's a mass shooting and they 're asked what they did to prevent it , they 're going to have to say nothing , '' she said .\nOn the other side , the NRA 's Chris Cox called the expanded background check proposal `` misguided , '' saying it would not reduce violent crime `` or keep our kids safe in their schools . ''\nThe broader gun package still under consideration by the Senate includes tougher laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases , and steps to devise ways to improve safety in schools .\nAs originally proposed , with a provision to expand background checks , it would have been the most significant gun legislation before Congress in almost two decades .\nDue to early opposition to the background check provision , Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania worked out a compromise that was less comprehensive than what Obama wanted but still gained the president 's support .\nThe Manchin-Toomey plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales , while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends .\nDue to procedural steps agreed to by both sides , all the amendments considered Wednesday required 60 votes to pass in the 100-member chamber , meaning Democrats and their independent allies who hold 55 seats needed support from some GOP senators to push through the Manchin-Toomey proposal .\nThe final vote was 54 in favor to 46 opposed with four Republicans joining most Democrats in supporting the compromise . With the outcome obvious , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , cast a `` no '' vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again .\nMeanwhile , four Democrats from pro-gun states voted with most Republicans in opposition .\nWhen the result was announced by Vice President Joe Biden , who presided over the chamber for the vote , two women in the gallery of spectators shouted `` shame on you '' at the senators .\n`` They are an embarrassment to this country that they do n't have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families , '' said one of them , Patricia Maisch , who grabbed the gun magazine from the attacker who shot Giffords and several other people in Tucson in January 2011 .\nOn the proposal by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California to update a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons that expired in 2004 , the vote was 40-60 , showing opposition by several Democrats as well as the chamber 's Republican minority .\nObama had pushed for Congress to include both the expanded background checks provision and the weapons ban in any gun package . In recent weeks , he and the White House focused their efforts on winning support for the Manchin-Toomey compromise .\nHowever , the NRA promised political retribution against supporters of tougher gun laws , and it called the expanded background checks a first step toward a national gun registry and government confiscation of firearms .\nObama called that claim misinformation , noting the Manchin-Toomey proposal prohibited such a registry . He said the tactics of the NRA galvanized a vocal minority of gun owners against the legislation , which caused some senators to flinch .\n`` They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment , '' Obama said . `` And obviously a lot of Republicans had that fear , but Democrats had that fear , too . And so they caved to the pressure . And they started looking for an excuse , any excuse to vote 'no . ' ''\nReid earlier warned Republicans that the strong majority of Americans who support expanded background checks wo n't forget votes against the Manchin-Toomey compromise .\n`` The American people ... have a long , long memory , '' he said .\nMeanwhile , an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the NRA position also was defeated .\nOfferd by conservative Republicans , the alternative plan introduced Wednesday after weeks of hearings and debate on Democratic proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system .\nA sponsor of the Republican alternative , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , said it would target the gun violence problem in a way that the Democratic proposal before the Senate would not .\nIn response , Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Leahy , D-Vermont , called the GOP 's last-minute proposal a `` weak and counterproductive alternative . ''\nOther proposed amendments defeated Wednesday included a plan by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country. , as well as a proposal by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to limit the number of rounds in ammunition magazines .\nAny legislation passed by the Senate would then go to the Republican-led House .

And the issue is electrified by politics , as over a thousand gun laws , divided between expansion and contraction of gun laws , have emerged in state houses across the country since the massacre of 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , on Dec. 14 .\nIndeed , as a federal gun-control package has been whittled down in the Senate , the real impact of Newtown is likely to be felt state to state , especially given some of the sweeping reforms that have already passed . The big question is what these legislative moves suggest about public support for more antiviolence gun controls , which have in the past spiked and then petered out after past mass shootings .\n`` We know that attention to these issues moves on relatively quickly , '' says Brendan Nyhan , a political scientist at Dartmouth College in Hanover , N.H .\nRecognizing that need for urgency , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo signed a tough new gun-control law into effect in New York . Colorado legislators are set to vote Monday on arguably the most meaningful bellwether gun-control package , one that would crimp the ability of Coloradoans to own certain types of ammunition magazines and institute universal background checks , closing the so-called gun show loophole .\nColorado 's stature as a traditional pioneer state with a progressive bent has made the outcome of that legislation especially interesting to national observers , as it may augur how similar proposals fare in other western states . Colorado has also been uniquely affected by gun violence at Columbine High School in 1999 and last year 's massacre in an Aurora movie theater .\nBut so far , many local governments have taken the opposite lesson from the Sandy Hook massacre . Instead of limiting the right to own weapons , their thinking goes , it 's instead a call to arms .\nTo many Americans , `` gun rights has become a civil rights movement , so it 's not just purely strategic politics , '' says Jennifer Carlson , a gun culture expert at the University of Toronto .\nCommunities in Idaho , Maine , and Georgia are all pondering whether to make gun ownership mandatory for residents , primarily to make up for emergency call time delays from distant police or sheriff departments .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

Chris Christie painted a bleak picture of America 's standing in the world on Sunday , blaming the Obama administration for making the country appear weak by not defending the nation 's values in other parts of the globe .\n`` No one understands any longer who America stands with or against , '' he argued . `` No one really understands exactly what we 'll stand for - and what we are willing to sacrifice to stand up for it . ''\nChristie said it 's time for the country 's leaders to `` stop singing a happy tune '' about the country 's condition . `` It is time for us to tell the truth about that condition and then to begin taking the hard and firm actions that are necessary to fix it , '' he continued .\nThe Republican governor made his remarks at a gala hosted by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach 's `` This World : Values Network '' in New York . Major Jewish figures , including Israel 's ambassador to the United States , as well as mega GOP donor Sheldon Adelson , attended the dinner .\nIf there was any doubt that Christie did n't line up with the more hawkish wing of the Republican Party , he firmly quashed those doubts Sunday night . Christie , who 's seriously considering a run for president , argued U.S. leaders needs to re-establish America 's reputation as a strong enforcer of freedom and promoter of prosperity , even if that requires `` sacrifice . ''\n`` We need to stand once again loudly for these values , and sometimes that is going to mean standing in some very messy , difficult places and standing strong and hard for those things that we believe in , '' he said . `` And it will mean sacrifice from the people of our country . ''\nChristie cited both domestic and foreign policy concerns as reasons for what he described as the country 's deteriorating status . At home , he blasted Washington for partisan gridlock on fiscal issues .\n`` We are and have become a dysfunctional government that even our own people snicker , laugh at , ignore and are disgusted by , '' he said , adding there was a time when developing democracies wanted to emulate America 's government , but that is no longer the case .\nOn international affairs , the governor referenced issues in Syria , Russia and Iran as three foreign policy areas in which the Obama administration has failed to show strength and credibility .\nHe said America `` is no longer sending clear signals to the world - consistent signals . ''\n`` Signals like the ones Ronald Reagan sent when he was president as to who our friends are and that we will stand with them without doubt , and to who our enemies are , who we will oppose regardless of the cost , '' he continued .\nChristie 's remarks solidify his stance on national security issues as the Republican Party is knee-deep in an ideological fight over foreign policy . That debate has perhaps played out most visibly between Christie and another potential 2016 contender , Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , who 's trying to woo the broader Republican base with his libertarian-leaning , non-interventionist views .\nChristie 's speech was widely anticipated in the Jewish community because the last time Christie appeared before a Jewish audience , he made a major blunder by referring to the `` occupied territories , '' a term Israel and its allies do n't use .\nMany Israelis do n't consider the territories to be occupied , but rather say Israel has a legitimate claim to the land . Palestinians , along with the United Nations , consider the West Bank to be Palestinian but under military occupation by Israel .\nIn a private meeting later with Adelson , the GOP donor , Christie said he `` misspoke '' and that he did n't believe the West Bank is `` occupied '' by Israel . While Christie did n't mention Israel in his speech Sunday , he made it clear that the United States should more overtly align with its allies , and he singled out Iran as a `` terrorist state '' with nuclear capability .", "President Trump unveiled his plan for Afghanistan after seven months of deliberation Monday evening , announcing tweaks around the edges of the current strategy instead of a different approach .\nHe announced five \u201c core pillars \u201d to the approach : getting rid of any timelines for how long U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan ; using all elements of power , including diplomatic and economic ; getting tougher on Pakistan ; getting India to help more with economic development ; and expanding authorities for U.S. forces to fight terrorists .\nWhat the president did not announce was how many more U.S. troops would head to Afghanistan , which he decided earlier this year to leave up to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to determine .\nHe did , however , say the U.S. would no longer talk about troop levels or drawdown dates , making it unclear whether troop increases would be announced .

Turkey launched a military operation Wednesday against Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria after U.S. forces pulled back from the area , with a series of airstrikes hitting a town on Syria 's northern border . ( AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis )\nAKCAKALE , Turkey ( AP ) \u2014 Turkey launched airstrikes , fired artillery and began a ground offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday after U.S. troops pulled back from the area , paving the way for an assault on forces that have long been allied with the United States .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the start of the campaign , which followed the abrupt decision Sunday by U.S. President Donald Trump to essentially abandon the Syrian Kurdish fighters , leaving them vulnerable to a Turkish offensive that was widely condemned around the world .\nThe decision was a major shift in U.S. policy and drew opposition from all sides at home . It also marked a stark change in rhetoric by Trump , who during a press conference in New York last year vowed to stand by the Kurds , who have been America \u2019 s only allies in Syria fighting the Islamic State group . Trump said at the time that the Kurds \u201c fought with us \u201d and \u201c died with us , \u201d and insisted that America would never forget .\nAfter Erdogan announced the offensive , Trump called the operation \u201c a bad idea. \u201d Later Wednesday , he said he didn \u2019 t want to be involved in \u201c endless , senseless wars . \u201d\nIn northern Syria , residents of the border areas were in a panic and got out on foot , in cars and with rickshaws piled with mattresses and a few belongings . It was a wrenchingly familiar scenario for the many who , only a few years ago , had fled the advances on their towns and villages by the Islamic State group .\nPlumes of smoke could be seen rising near the town of Qamishli and clashes continued late Wednesday amid intense shelling as Turkey struck at least six different border towns along a 290-mile ( 300-kilometer ) stretch . At least seven civilians and three members of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in the Turkish bombardment , Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said .\nTurkey \u2019 s campaign \u2014 in which a NATO member rained down bombs on an area where hundreds of U.S. troops had been stationed \u2014 drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe . In his statement , Trump emphasized that there are no American soldiers in the immediate area under attack .\n\u201c Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border , and to bring peace to the area , \u201d Erdogan said in a tweet announcing what he called \u201c Operation Peace Spring . \u201d\nHe said that Turkish forces , with Ankara-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army , had begun to eradicate what he called \u201c the threat of terror \u201d against Turkey .\nMustafa Bali , a spokesman for the U.S.-backed SDF , said Turkish warplanes were targeting \u201c civilian areas \u201d in northern Syria and that shells also had fallen near a prison guarded by Kurds and holding some of the most dangerous IS militants . The AP could not verify the report independently .\nIn Washington , officials said two British militants believed to be part of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages and was known as \u201c The Beatles \u201d had been moved out of a detention center in Syria and were in U.S. custody .\nBefore Turkey \u2019 s attack , Syrian Kurdish forces who control nearly 30 percent of Syria \u2019 s territory warned of a \u201c humanitarian catastrophe. \u201d More than 2 million people live in the area impacted by the attacks , according to aid groups .\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the Turkish bombardments included two Christian Assyrians in Qamishli , a married couple and their child , a man in a village outside the town of Tal Abyad , and a child in a village west of Qamishli .\nThe Turkish operation meant to create a \u201c safe zone \u201d carries potential gains and risk for Turkey by getting its forces even more deeply involved in the Syria war . It also ignites new fighting in Syria \u2019 s 8-year-old war , potentially displacing hundreds of thousands .\nA resident of Tal Abyad said one of the bombs hit an SDF post , and he fled with his wife and mother by car to Raqqa , nearly 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) to the south , to flee the bombing . The resident , who gave his name as Maher , said the road to Raqqa was packed with vehicles and families , some fleeing on foot \u201c to get away from the bombing . \u201d\n\u201c People fled and left everything behind , \u201d he said in a text message after he reached safety .\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey . Expectations of an invasion increased after Trump \u2019 s announcement Sunday , although he also threatened to \u201c totally destroy and obliterate \u201d Turkey \u2019 s economy if the Turkish push went too far .\nU.S. critics said he was sacrificing an ally , the Syrian Kurdish forces , and undermining Washington \u2019 s credibility . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , a Trump ally , told \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d that if Trump \u201c follows through with this , it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency . \u201d\nTrump later said the U.S. \u201c does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea . \u201d\nTrump said he made clear from the start of his political career that \u201c I did not want to fight these endless , senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don \u2019 t benefit the United States . Turkey has committed to protecting civilians , protecting religious minorities , including Christians , and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment . \u201d\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg , while noting that Turkey \u201c has legitimate security concerns \u201d after suffering \u201c horrendous terrorist attacks \u201d and hosting thousands of refugees , said the country should not \u201c further destabilize the region \u201d with its military action in Syria .\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the offensive , saying it will \u201c further destabilize the region and strengthen IS. \u201d The operation also was criticized by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker .\nThe EU is paying Turkey 6 billion euros ( $ 6.6 billion ) to help the country cope with almost 4 million Syrian refugees on its territory in exchange for stopping migrants leaving for Europe .\nThe Turkish presidency \u2019 s communications director urged the international community to rally behind Ankara . In a Washington Post column published Wednesday , Fahrettin Altun said Turkey aimed to \u201c neutralize \u201d Syrian Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria and to \u201c liberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs . \u201d\nErdogan discussed the incursion by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Erdogan \u2019 s office said he told Putin the military action \u201c will contribute to the peace and stability \u201d and allow for a political process in Syria .\nIn its call for a general mobilization , the local civilian Kurdish authority known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria asked the global community to fulfill its responsibilities and for the U.S.-led coalition to set up a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria to protect the civilian population from Turkish airstrikes .\nThe Syrian Kurdish group urged Moscow to broker talks with the Syrian government in Damascus in light of the Turkish operation . The Syrian Kurdish-led administration said it viewed positively calls from Moscow encouraging the Kurds and the Syrian government to settle their difference through talks .\nSyria \u2019 s Foreign Ministry condemned Turkey \u2019 s military strike , calling it a \u201c blatant violation \u201d of international law and vowing to repel the incursion .\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Washington of playing \u201c very dangerous games \u201d with the Syrian Kurds , saying the U.S. first propped up the Kurdish \u201c quasi state \u201d in Syria and now is withdrawing support .\n\u201c Such reckless attitude to this highly sensitive subject can set fire to the entire region , and we have to avoid it at any cost , \u201d he said in Kazakhstan .\nEarlier Wednesday , three IS militants targeted the SDF in Raqqa , once the de facto IS capital at the height of the militants \u2019 power . An activist collective in Raqqa reported an exchange of fire and an explosion ; the Observatory said two IS fighters engaged in a shootout before blowing themselves up .\nIS claimed responsibility , saying one of its members killed or wounded 13 SDF members .\nThe SDF , which holds thousands of IS fighters in detention facilities in northeastern Syria , has warned that a Turkish incursion might lead to the resurgence of the extremists . The U.S.-allied Kurdish-led force captured the last IS area controlled by the militants in eastern Syria in March .\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut . \u2588\u2588\u2588 writers Suzan Fraser in Ankara , Turkey ; Mehmet Guzel in Akcakale , Turkey ; Nasser Karimi in Tehran , Iran ; Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow ; and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed .", "The administration Kabuki dance we \u2019 re witnessing featuring U.S. refusal to provide nonlethal support equipment for Ukraine is President Obama displaying the new \u201c flexibility \u201d he promised Vladimir Putin he would have after his re-election . In short , it is capitulation .\nThe administration is trying to make the case that by showing restraint , Mr. Obma will encourage Mr. Putin , the Russian president , to be more willing to negotiate . The mind boggles . What \u2019 s taking place in Ukraine has far-reaching implications for the United States and our allies in both Europe and the Far East .\nThe apparent lack of support from NATO \u2019 s political leadership to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty is clearly tied to its dependence on Russia for more than 30 percent of their energy requirements . This compromised position was accepted based on the assumption that European security after the Cold War could be guaranteed ( with reduced defense budgets ) by engaging Russia , not confronting it .\nThis now appears to be a costly error , since it has been known for some time that NATO \u2019 s engagement policies have not required Russia \u2019 s reciprocity . However , one positive outcome of the current crisis should be an unmistakable wake-up call for NATO , as its credibility is clearly being challenged .\nThe administration \u2019 s rationale for not providing nonlethal equipment , such as night-vision devices , body armor , medical kits , uniforms , boots and military socks to the \u201c victim \u201d is that it could be perceived by Russia as \u201c destabilizing \u201d and as a \u201c force-multiplier , \u201d and , therefore , too provocative . This is nonsense . Russia has deployed 40,000 fully equipped , modernized troops backed up by tanks , aircraft and helicopters , plus paid KGB goon squads that are creating havoc in Eastern Ukraine .\nMr. Obama responds by debating whether to provide what amounts to humanitarian aid because he doesn \u2019 t want to encourage Ukraine \u2019 s leadership to take more aggressive action to protect its sovereignty . With this type of convoluted thinking , we \u2019 d better hope that this administration and its national security team never gets us into a war that requires real leadership .\nWhat is behind such thinking ? Is Mr. Obama concerned that Mr. Putin will somehow scuttle his precious P5+1 ( the five permanent members of the United Nations \u2014 the U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France \u2014 plus Germany ) negotiations with Iran over its nuclear-weapons program ? We can only hope that Mr. Putin would take such an action , as those negotiations are nothing but a sham . According to Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper , Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in about two weeks , once the order is given .\nSymptomatic of the Ukraine crisis , no matter where you look , the United States is seen as being in retreat . The stability that America brought to the global strategic equation is being systematically dismantled by the Obama administration , principally by the unilateral disarmament of our military forces .\nThe Ukraine situation is far from being resolved . China is flexing its military muscle in the Far East . The Middle East remains in chaos . Iran \u2019 s nuclear-weapons capability is almost a certainty . With the unpredictability of North Korea , why would the Obama administration at this time make the shocking announcement of deep cuts to the U.S. nuclear forces , four years ahead of the 2010 New START treaty schedule ?\nOur most secure deterrent , our strategic ballistic-missile submarines , will be reduced by 28 percent by having the capability of 56 launch strikes disabled . Thirty B-52 strategic bombers will be converted to conventional use , which represents a 38 percent reduction in capability , and 50 missiles will be removed from our underground silos , which is the most vulnerable leg of the triad .\nWith every nuclear power in the world modernizing its strategic forces , particularly Russia and China , plus the known fact that Russia has been cheating on existing treaties , making such a dramatic force-reduction announcement now is more than troubling .\nThe Obama administration is taking the United States down a course that will put us in an absolute nuclear inferiority position with regard to Russia and perhaps China . It is jeopardizing our national security .\nWith the United States \u2019 strategic policy adrift , Mr. Putin is controlling events in the Ukraine . With basically no opposition , he will certainly seek more opportunities . In the Far East , we can anticipate that China , seeing our basic inability to respond to the Ukraine crisis , will seize the opportunity to absorb some low-hanging fruit in the South China Sea , most likely contested Philippine islands .\nWhat will it take to make Congress exercise its constitutional responsibilities and maintain its legitimacy by acting in the best interest of the United States ? We are being challenged , and we can not afford to continue to embrace a fantasy foreign policy .\nJames A. Lyons , U.S. Navy retired admiral , was commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and senior U.S. military representative to the United Nations .", "The Obama administration has yet to articulate a clear course of action to dismantle ISIL . Obama 's blurry foreign policy vision\nThe extremist Islamic group that beheaded journalist James Foley has been described as \u201c wicked \u201d and an \u201c imminent threat , \u201d and President Barack Obama has vowed to be \u201c relentless \u201d in pursuing it .\nYet for all the vivid rhetoric in recent days , the Obama administration has yet to articulate a clear course of action to dismantle the radical group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and is struggling to lay out a precise vision to respond to the new threats in chaotic areas of Iraq and Syria where ISIL has thrived in recent months .\nThe lack of clarity in the U.S. approach to the region has underscored claims by critics \u2014 including voices generally friendly to the White House \u2014 questioning whether Obama \u2019 s foreign policy message is coherent enough to win support across the globe .\nAnd the disconnect between dramatic condemnations and decisive action against ISIL threatens to leave the president looking ineffective or even impotent , just as his call for Syrian President Bashar Assad to resign remains unheeded three years later .\nAt the daily briefing for reporters Monday , White House press secretary Josh Earnest faced a barrage of questions about whether Obama is prepared to expand the campaign against ISIL and whether Obama \u2019 s policies on the subject are muddled .\n\u201c The president has been very clear about what he believes our priorities are in Iraq , why he believes it \u2019 s important for the United States to pursue a comprehensive approach to countering the threat that \u2019 s posed by ISIL , not just to Iraq , but also to Americans and American interests , \u201d Earnest said . \u201c That strategy includes some of the military strikes that the president has ordered . \u201d\nProminent foreign policy figures , including Democrats such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Rep. Jane Harman , as well as a broad range of Republicans , have argued recently that the message the U.S. is projecting abroad is murky .\n\u201c Great nations need organizing principles , and \u2018 Don \u2019 t do stupid stuff \u2019 is not an organizing principle , \u201d Clinton told The Atlantic \u2019 s Jeffrey Goldberg in an interview earlier this month , adding , \u201c One issue is that we don \u2019 t even tell our own story very well these days . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s remarks caused a stir mainly because they were taken as criticism of Obama , but less attention was paid to the substance of her critique , which seemed to track very closely statements made earlier in the summer by Harman , who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying it is U.S. foreign policy , but the perception of our foreign policy in much of the Middle East is : \u2018 Don \u2019 t do stupid stuff \u2014 plus use drones , \u2019 \u201d Harman told an audience at the Aspen Security Forum in July . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s winning any heart or mind or any mind or heart . \u201d\n\u201c The perception has to be that we stand for things and not only stand for them , but live those values , \u201d Harman added . \u201c We \u2019 re just not making the sale right now for lots of reasons . \u2026 Our narrative needs a lot of work . \u201d\nWhile Obama did authorize a \u201c limited \u201d U.S. military campaign to bomb ISIL positions in Iraq earlier this month , he has yet to expand that military effort to try to eradicate the group there or across the border in Syria . Despite Obama \u2019 s talk of a \u201c relentless \u201d effort against ISIL , the limits he has articulated \u2014 such as \u201c no boots on the ground \u201d \u2014 have been clearer than the indications of how far the U.S. is willing to go to fight the militant group .\nWhile some observers expected Obama might lay out his ISIL policy in greater detail during a speech Tuesday to an American Legion convention in North Carolina , the White House said Monday the address would focus mainly on issues like problems at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals .\nBut the president will need to move quickly ; the issue is increasingly urgent in Europe , which has had thousands of Muslim citizens join the fighting in Syria \u2014 a substantial number of those with ISIL . The strategy debate is likely to be a significant theme in Obama \u2019 s diplomatic talks over the next month . The president is scheduled to attend a NATO summit in Wales next week and in mid-September is expected to host a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York focused specifically on the dangers posed by foreign fighters in Syria who might return to Europe or the U.S. to carry out terrorist attacks .\nWhen pressed Monday about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel \u2019 s comments declaring ISIL to be an \u201c imminent threat \u201d to American interests worldwide , Earnest straddled , preferring to call the group \u201c a significant threat \u201d and hedging about the dangers it poses to Americans outside Iraq and Syria .\n\u201c This is a complicated situation , but there is no question that there is a significant threat that \u2019 s posed by ISIL , in part because of their demonstrated military capacity ; in part also because they have demonstrated access to significant financial resources , \u201d Earnest said .\nEarnest also insisted that when Obama told The New Yorker magazine earlier this year that some radicals were \u201c JV \u201d or junior varsity players pretending to be more threatening than they were , he was not referring specifically to ISIL .\n\u201c The president was not singling out ISIL , Earnest said . \u201c He was talking about the very different threat that is posed by a range of extremists around the globe . Many of them do not have designs on attacking the West or on attacking the United States , and that is what puts them in stark contrast to the goals and capability of the previously existing Al Qaeda core network that was led by Osama bin Laden . \u201d\nAnalysts said the White House \u2019 s tone toward ISIL has changed markedly in recent weeks and that the policy also appears to be shifting .\n\u201c The rhetoric has changed from the \u2018 JV \u2019 comment , \u201d the Middle East Institute \u2019 s Paul Salem said . \u201c Although some in the intelligence community and government agencies were apparently sounding the alarm , it seems that as it went up in the echelons of government that alarm was not sounded in a major way two months ago to the president . \u201d", "LONDON \u2014 Britain 's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Iran of `` serious consequences '' if it does not release a British-flagged oil tanker it seized in the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway on Friday , although he ruled out `` military options . ''\nHunt announced later in a tweet that he had spoken with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and `` expressed extreme disappointment '' that Iran had `` behaved in the opposite way '' of trying to deescalate the situation .\nThe seizing of the `` Stena Impero '' potentially marks the most significant escalation in tensions between Iran and the West since they began rising in May , about a year after the United States pulled out of an international accord aimed at Iran 's nuclear program .\nThe Pentagon announced it authorized the movement of troops to Saudi Arabia as an `` additional deterrent , '' adding to the 1,000 troops deployed to the Middle East in June .\nThe showdown has caused concerns around the globe , with each maneuver bringing fear that any misunderstanding or misstep by either side could lead to war .\n`` It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region , '' Hunt said late Friday , ahead of an emergency government meeting . He subsequently told British media that `` we \u2019 re looking at a diplomatic way to resolve the situation , but we are very clear that it must be resolved . ''\nAbout a fifth of the world 's crude oil exports passes through the Strait of Hormuz .\nIran \u2019 s Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) said Friday that the `` Stena Impero '' was taken to an Iranian port because it was not complying with `` international maritime laws and regulations . '' On Saturday , Iran 's state-run IRNA news agency reported that the `` Stena Impero '' collided with an Iranian fishing boat , causing it damage , and then failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft . The fishing boat informed Iran \u2019 s Ports and Maritime Organization , which notified the IRGC . The IRGC launched an investigation .\nFARS , Iran 's semi-official news agency , later released video showing the IRGC seizing the ship .\nIran 's Revolutionary Guard also released a new , high-quality video of the incident , showing commandos in black ski masks rappelling from a helicopter onto the vessel .\nA statement from Stena Bulk , which owns the seized tanker , said the ship had 23 crew members aboard when it was seized . They are from India , Russia , Latvia and the Philippines . There were no reports suggesting of any of them were injured .\nAnother British ship was briefly detained Friday before allowed to go . The owner of the Liberian-flagged , but British-owned , tanker said it was boarded by armed guards . The `` Mesdar '' vessel has left Iran \u2019 s territorial waters , Iran state media said .\n`` This only goes to show what I \u2019 m saying about Iran : trouble , '' President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House . `` Nothing but trouble . ''\nTrump declined to say whether the moves by Iran crossed a `` red line '' or how the U.S. might respond . He noted the U.S. has a maritime security agreement with Britain .\nThe latest incident follows a threat by Iran to seize a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf after British Royal Marines earlier this month helped capture an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar , in the Mediterranean Sea , suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions . Iran denied the ship was on its way to Syria .\nSuggesting the tanker seizure could have been a retaliatory act , FARS reported a spokesperson for Iran 's Guardian Council , Abbas Ali Kadkhodayee , as saying , `` The rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law which is used against the foul measures of a government , '' adding that the seizure of the ship was a `` correct measure ... based on international rights . ''\nU.S. patrol aircraft are in the vicinity monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz , and Naval Forces Central Command has been in contact with American ships in the area to ensure their safety , a Department of Defense official said . Britain has sent additional warships to the area and been escorting oil tankers in the region .\nU.S. Central Command said it in the process of developing a `` multinational maritime effort , '' called `` Operation Sentinel , '' to increase security of key Middle East waterways .\nLast month , Trump abruptly canceled a planned retaliatory attack on Iran after the country downed an unmanned U.S. drone , but his administration has kept up a policy of trying to squeeze Iran 's leaders with stiff economic sanctions . Days after he pulled back the strikes on Iran , Trump threatened to use `` overwhelming force '' against Iran if it attacked any U.S. assets or personnel . Trump announced that the U.S. `` destroyed '' an Iranian drone on Thursday . Iran said there is no evidence for that .\n`` If ( Stena Impero ) has been taken to Bandar Abbas then that \u2019 s an important Iranian military port and I think any military options will therefore be extremely unwise , '' Tom Tugendhat , chairman of Britain 's parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee , told the BBC .\nContributing : Doug Stanglin , Nicholas Wu , David Jackson , Donovan Slack and John Fritze , from Washington , D.C. ; Associated Press", "The sheer size and frequency of the recent credit card data breaches at Target , Neiman Marcus and other companies are prompting lawmakers to consider legislative options to keep sophisticated cyberthefts from happening .\n`` If anything , we 've learned from this major , major breach that we can no longer do nothing , '' said Sen. Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn. `` We have to take action . ''\nThe bad guys who stole data from as many as 110 million Target customers are so good at what they do that even the most modern security programs could n't detect them . If security software ca n't keep up , hopes for regulation to stop fraud are slim .\n`` This is kind of an ongoing war , and the types of threats are changing all the time , '' said Fran Rosch , a vice president at the security software company Symantec . He appeared Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary panel , which explored legislative options in data security .\n`` Information 's everywhere , '' Rosch said . `` It 's in our data centers , it 's in the cloud . It 's in software that sits in the cloud and on our mobile devices . So the threats are exploding , but so are the attack surfaces . ''\nLawmakers are considering a few policy changes to better protect consumers , such as pushing for more secure credit and debit cards . American credit cards have already failed to keep up with European and Asian card technology , which feature encrypted chips . The chips prevent cyberthieves from reusing any data after they steal it .\n`` What 's stopping our country when they 're doing this in Europe ? '' Klobuchar asked .\nPart of the problem is the complexity of the American financial system , which has so many competing card issuers , banks , retailers and business owners . Adopting systemic change to the way purchases are made would cost retailers and banks hundreds of millions of dollars .\nBut the recent breaches were so costly that both banks and retailers are backing a changeover to chip technology together .\n`` All of us have to move together simultaneously ; it 's a shared responsibility , '' said Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan . `` The financial industry , obviously they 're , in general , the issuers of the cards . So again , in partnership with them , we need to move together collectively so the whole system is employing chip and PIN technology . ''\nVisa and Mastercard are aiming to have chips in the majority of U.S. cards by October 2015 , but it could be even longer before retail outlets change their card readers . Lawmakers are asking what they could do to speed up the change .\nAnother plan would be to tighten data theft disclosure and security standards , an option pushed by Sen. Al Franken , D-Minn .\n`` Right now there 's no federal law setting out clear security standards that merchants and data brokers need to meet , and there 's no federal law requiring companies to tell their customers when their data has been stolen , '' Franken said .\nFranken and Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , are co-sponsoring the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act , which includes those disclosure and security standards . Both retailers and security companies who appeared before senators Tuesday signaled support .\nBut the fast-changing tech terrain makes some lawmakers wary of any attempt at national standards .\n`` I 'm always a little bit concerned about creating a new federal regulatory authority , '' said Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , `` in part because sometimes when you establish something like that it can quickly become ineffective , especially if it 's in an area like this one .

Occupations that are typically associated with people running for office \u2014 lawyers , career politicians , business men and women \u2014 were the most frequently listed .\nThere 's a reason there are not a lot of STEM professionals in Congress , says Shaughnessy Naughton , founder of 314 Action , an advocacy group that helps candidates with such a background move beyond advocacy and into action .\nNaughton started the group \u2014 named after the most widely known mathematical ratio \u2014 in 2016 in response to concern about the Trump administration 's attacks on science , especially the president 's stance on climate change . And 314 Action helped eight of the new STEM professionals get elected to Congress in the recent elections .\nNaughton says while there are procedural hurdles for anyone trying to break into politics , scientists also face cultural barriers .\n`` Scientists and physicians and STEM professionals often think of science as above politics , or their profession is above politics and therefore they should n't be involved in politics , '' says Naughton , who staged an unsuccessful campaign for Congress herself in 2014 and then again in 2016 . `` And I think we see the results of that attitude by just a real dearth of people with scientific backgrounds and the often misplaced priorities that are put forward [ by Congress ] .

Eight of them won their races , while the five candidates who did not still made tremendous gains in promoting STEM backgrounds as a way to talk about local issues , says Naughton .\n`` I think it 's important because we would have a policy more based in facts and evidence , '' Naughton tells NPR . `` But I also think we would have a more collaborative approach to governing if more scientists were at the table .

Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , and Louie Gohmert , R-Texas , introduced the resolution on Friday .\n\u201c Evidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and from the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies , \u201d Gaetz said in a statement Friday . \u201c A confidential U.S. witness , working in the Russian nuclear industry , revealed that Russia had deeply compromised an American uranium trucking firm through bribery and financial kickbacks . \u201d\nGaetz was referring to Mueller \u2019 s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia \u2019 s Rosatom , which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company , Uranium One , that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves . At the time of the probe , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who appointed Mueller as special counsel , was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director . Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe .\nMUELLER FACING NEW REPUBLICAN PRESSURE TO RESIGN IN RUSSIA PROBE\nGaetz also pointed to the FBI informant , whose gag order was lifted by the Justice Department last week , and is now able to provide information to Congress , free of the FBI \u2019 s nondisclosure agreement he signed when Mueller served as director .\n\u201c Although federal agents possessed this information in 2010 , the Department of Justice continued investigating this \u201c matter \u201d for over four years . The FBI , led at the time by Robert Mueller , required the confidential witness to sign a non-disclosure agreement . When the witness attempted to contact Congress and federal courts about the bribery and corruption he saw , he was threatened with legal action , \u201d Gaetz said in a statement . \u201c By silencing him , Obama \u2019 s Justice Department and Mueller \u2019 s FBI knowingly kept Congress in the dark about Russia \u2019 s significant and illegal involvement with American uranium companies . \u201d\nGaetz said that due to these \u201c deeply troubling \u201d events , Mueller \u2019 s \u201c impartiality is hopelessly compromised . \u201d\nRep.

In addition , this law also means trouble for the 100 chimpanzees currently housed in Chimp Haven , designated as retired .\n`` We have hit this wall , and we need this fixed , or else come mid- to end-November , we will not be able to pay Chimp Haven to take care of these animals , '' said Dr. Kathy Hudson , NIH Deputy Director for Science , Outreach and Policy . `` Scientifically , ethically and economically that is a bad idea . ''\nThat wall Hudson is talking about is a $ 30 million spending limit , enacted under a law in 2000 that legally obligates the NIH to only spend that much of its appropriated funds on the sanctuary care for these chimpanzees .\nThese 60 chimps that have been designated to head into retirement are not alone . There are many more waiting behind them , since the Institute of Medicine advised the NIH to retire all of its biomedical research chimps , in favor of better , less expensive models for medical research . However , 50 chimpanzees will be placed on retainer in case they are needed for crucial medical studies that could be performed no other way .\nThere is wide bipartisan support for amending the law , but somehow , the permission slip got lost during the mess that was the government shutdown .\nWednesday , Senator Tom Harkin , D , Iowa , Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor , Health and Human Services , Education , and Related Agencies , will get the ball rolling in his committee , by introducing The CHIMP Act Amendments of 2013 ( S. 1561 ) , a bipartisan bill that the Committee will consider at an executive session .\n`` The National Institutes of Health has made a worthy and important decision to scale back the use of chimpanzees in medical research . Current law limits NIH 's ability to use its existing funds to provide care to its chimpanzees already housed in sanctuaries , in addition to carrying out the important goal of moving the chimps current living in research labs . We have an obligation to provide care for animals that have directly contributed to our medical knowledge , and it is absolutely urgent that Congress act to remove this funding limitation now and for the future , '' the senator said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHudson has faith that this issue will be resolved quickly by Congress .\n`` This is really an issue where there is no divide , it would be impossible to find someone who did n't support the NIH in taking care of these animals that have contributed greatly to biomedical research , '' Hudson said . `` We are very grateful to the members and staff that have contributed to this bill and think it will move quickly through house and senate . ''\nHarkin also expressed his hope for a quick bipartisan movement to ensure the chimps enjoy the sunset of their lives . `` Moving these chimps to sanctuary care is not only the right thing to do , but doing so would also be more cost-efficient for NIH and for taxpayers . I hope that Democrats and Republicans can work together to ensure that NIH can use resources it already has on hand to ensure these chimps ' well-being now and in the future , '' he said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHudson agreed and explained that it is more cost effective to care for the chimps that are not being used in research in the sanctuary . `` We 're not breeding these animals , and they are an aging population . It will be more economical to have these animals there ; overtime these costs will go down . ''", "( CNN ) In the struggle between Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Democratic-controlled House , the immovable object may finally have met an irresistible force .\nMcConnell has been the immovable object : He 's frustrated House Democrats by systematically blocking Senate votes so far on the lengthening list of bills they have passed , from gun control to additional protections for patients with preexisting health problems .\nBut McConnell 's blockade faces a new challenge as the House turns to a series of bills meant to fight foreign interference in the 2020 election . Those measures , aimed at defending fundamental American institutions from foreign subversion , may be tougher for the Kentucky Republican to portray as partisan overreach than the bills the House has passed so far . And that could make them an irresistible force that strains his overall strategy of preventing action on any House legislation .\n`` It could be the thing that has the public home in on where the problem is , where the obstruction is , '' says Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland , a leading author of the House election security agenda . `` The public , and I understand that , they paint everything with a broad brush and they say Washington is dysfunctional . Here 's a case study that they are going to be very interested in , that shows ... the problem is not with Washington , the problem is not broadly with Congress , the problem is with Mitch McConnell , who will not bring any of these things to the Senate floor . ''\nMcConnell 's decision to methodically bar consideration of any of the House priorities already looms as a defining gamble in the GOP 's effort to maintain its Senate majority in next year 's election . He has leaned into his role as obstacle , portraying a Republican-controlled Senate as the last line of defense against a Democratic `` socialist agenda '' and calling himself the `` Grim Reaper '' for their legislative plans .\n`` I am indeed the 'Grim Reaper ' when it comes to the socialist agenda that they have been ginning up over the House with overwhelming Democratic support , and sending it over to America , '' he declared in an interview on Fox News Channel last week . `` Things that would turn us into a country we have never been . '' McConnell 's campaign is even providing contributors with T-shirts featuring a tombstone for `` socialism '' on the front and a similar quote underscoring his determination to block the House agenda on the back .\nThe electoral impact of McConnell 's strategy will likely be determined by which side successfully defines the agenda he is obstructing .\n`` He talks about that almost every opportunity he can , '' says Josh Holmes , McConnell 's former chief of staff . `` Being in opposition to health care plans that end private health insurance or environmental deals that basically shut down your electricity provider is something that he 's pretty comfortable with . ''\nBut neither single-payer health care nor the Green New Deal , which Republicans are confident they can paint as unprecedented government intrusion into the economy , is likely to reach a vote on the House floor , much less pass the chamber , before 2020 .\nInstead , the legislation the House has passed this year -- and that McConnell is blocking -- has focused more on expressions of social values and bread-and-butter economic concerns , like buttressing the Affordable Care Act and confronting high prescription drug costs . Many of these measures enjoy preponderant support from the public in polls .\nnearly three-fourths of Americans said they supported legal status for those young people . The House , for instance , in early June passed legislation that provides legal status for potentially millions of `` Dreamers , '' young people brought to the country illegally as children . In a Fox News poll released Sunday , nearly three-fourths of Americans said they supported legal status for those young people .\ndilute the Affordable Care Act 's protections for patients with preexisting medical problems . In April Also in May , the House passed legislation to block regulatory actions by the Trump administration that woulddilute the Affordable Care Act 's protections for patients with preexisting medical problems . In April polling by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation , about two-thirds of Americans said it was important that health insurers be required to sell coverage to consumers with preexisting health conditions and be prevented from charging them more .\nOther House-passed measures this year include the Violence Against Women Act , legislation promoting greater gender equity in pay and comprehensive legislation to expand voting rights and impose new ethics guidelines on Washington . Senior Democratic House aides are confident that by the 2020 election , they will also pass legislation creating a nationwide $ 15 minimum wage , expanding the subsidies for families to purchase health insurance through the ACA 's exchanges , updating the Voting Rights Act and combating the rising costs of prescription drugs .\nThe strong public support for most of these ideas has Democrats cautiously optimistic that their challengers next year can portray incumbent Republican senators as part of a `` do-nothing Senate '' blocking action on important concerns .\n`` When your occupation is to vote every day down the line against things that matter to voters ... sure , we are going to make those a significant issue , '' says J.B. Poersch , president of Senate Majority PAC , a leading Democratic super PAC .\nDemocrats have been frustrated so far by their inability to create more pressure on McConnell to take up any of the House-passed bills ; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a news conference last week where she brandished a chart showing `` McConnell 's graveyard '' of bills that he had blocked , complete with miniature tombstones .\nHolmes , now president of a Washington communications firm , says House Democrats today face the same unforgiving equation Republicans did in 2013-14 . During that congressional session , the GOP-controlled House passed a series of conservative priorities , only to see them systematically blocked by the Democratic majority led by then-Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada . Despite loud complaints , House Republicans could never generate enough pressure on Reid to force him to allow votes on the GOP plans .\nMcConnell feels politically secure bottling up the House priorities , Holmes says , `` for the same reason Harry Reid did n't feel particularly moved by the fact that ( then-Speaker ) John Boehner had moved every conservative bill dealing with the economy or social issues possible . The priorities of Nancy Pelosi are not the priorities of Mitch McConnell , period . And he 's very comfortable with that . ''\nElection security , though , could be an issue that causes at least some GOP senators to question McConnell 's blockade . Sarbanes , who chaired the House Democrats ' Democracy Reform Task Force , says the party plans to pass by August `` a suite '' of bills to safeguard the 2020 election against foreign interference .\nThose bills will include some measures already included in the House 's omnibus political overhaul legislation , HR 1 , that would provide states with more money to harden voting systems against possible foreign intrusion and mandate that the Department of Homeland Security develop a strategy for resisting such attacks .\nThe House also plans to pass new measures requiring campaigns to notify federal law enforcement officials if they are approached by foreign operatives with damaging information on their opponents , as well as provisions barring campaigns from sharing internal information with foreign officials , mandating more disclosure of foreign ad purchases on digital platforms and clarifying that it is illegal to work with foreigners to influence an American election .\n`` We may not get every single piece of this package onto the floor and passed and directed to the Senate before August but we want to get a good critical mass of these important measures in place , '' Sarbanes says .\nPolls have shown broad public support for further action to resist interference by Russia or other foreign actors in the 2020 election . A Monmouth University poll last month found that 60 % of Americans believe the government is not doing enough to guard against such interference ; a survey by Democratic pollster Geoff Garin for the bipartisan advocacy group Law Works Action found that more than 4 in 5 Americans support a requirement that political campaigns notify law enforcement officials of foreign offers of assistance .\nMcConnell , as noted above , has felt comfortable blocking debate on other House-passed legislation with comparably lopsided levels of public support . But House Democrats are hopeful that more Senate Republicans will demand that he allow action on these issues because the public is likely to see them as less partisan .\n`` I think it 's going to be a very difficult place for him to be , opposing these things that are supposed to protect the fundamental principles of our democracy , '' Sarbanes says . `` This is about ... protecting ourselves from foreign interference , having confidence that our elections are being carried out in a free and fair and uninfluenced way . It 's baseline stuff ; it 's Founding Fathers kind of principles here . If you stand in the way of measures that are designed to safeguard these principles , I think you are standing in the way of American democracy or at least not respecting it . ''\nMcConnell has n't yet definitively closed the door on election security legislation . He 's committed to a full Senate briefing later this month from intelligence officials on the possible risks .\n`` I would suspect that has a huge amount of influence about what ultimately the Senate does in this space , '' says Holmes .\nBut all signals from McConnell suggest he 's unlikely to accept almost any new federal initiatives on election security . Last week , Senate Republicans blocked an effort by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia to force a vote on a `` duty to report '' bill , which many Republicans consider an effort to embarrass President Donald Trump . McConnell shrugged off Trump 's comments , which drew widespread condemnation in both parties , that `` you might want to listen '' to a foreign government offering dirt on a 2020 opponent . And Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri , a member of the GOP leadership , has publicly declared that McConnell is unlikely to allow any election security bill to reach the floor , whatever the House does next .\nThat opposition reflects both McConnell 's long-standing resistance to federal influence over any aspect of election activity ( he 's long been the leading opponent of campaign finance regulation ) and his reluctance to take actions that provoke Trump . But it risks allowing Democrats to make election security a powerful symbol for the wider wall McConnell has constructed against the legislation passing the House .\nIn a sign of what may be ahead , the Texas Democratic Party on Monday , for instance , chastised Republican Sen. John Cornyn , who 's up for reelection next year , for joining the Republican opposition to Warner 's legislation on disclosing foreign contacts . `` If Cornyn is unwilling to legislate , what exactly is he in Washington for ? '' Abhi Rahman , the party 's communications director , said in a statement .\nThe ordinarily taciturn McConnell has enthusiastically accepted the persona of the `` Grim Reaper '' for House priorities . The question is whether the Senate leader is embracing that identity to a point that helps Democrats entomb the GOP Senate majority in 2020 .", "The chairman of a House committee that recommended a contempt citation against Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in its Fast and Furious investigation said on Tuesday President Obama \u2019 s assertion of executive privilege in the matter means the White House is covering up its involvement in the botched operation or is obstructing a congressional probe .\n\u201c To date , the White House has steadfastly maintained that it has not had any role in advising the [ Justice ] Department with respect to the congressional investigation , \u201d Rep. Darrell Issa , California Republican , said in a tersely-worded seven page letter to Mr. Obama .\n\u201c The surprising assertion of executive privilege raised the question of whether that is still the case , \u201d he said .\nMr. Issa , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , also challenged the validity of the privilege claim , saying courts have \u201c consistently held \u201d that executive privilege applies only to documents and communications that involve the president \u2019 s decision-making process .\nAccordingly , he said , the assertion could only mean that Mr. Obama \u201c or your most senior advisers \u201d were involved in managing the Fast and Furious operation \u201c and the fallout from it , \u201d or the president was asserting a privilege he knew to be \u201c unjustified solely for the purpose of further obstruction a congressional investigation . \u201d\nThe committee voted 23-17 last week along strict party lines to recommend to the full House that Mr. Holder be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over hundreds of pages of Fast and Furious documents sought by the panel under a subpoena . The executive privilege assertion came only shortly before the committee was scheduled to vote on the recommendation .\nThe House is expected to vote on the recommendation later this week .\nMr. Obama previously has denied any knowledge of the Fast and Furious operation , and has stood solidly behind Mr. Holder despite an increasing chorus of calls by Republicans for his resignation .\nFast and Furious was a gunrunning operation by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) aimed at identifying drug smuggling bosses in Mexico who were buying weapons out of Phoenix area gun shops . More than 2,000 weapons , including AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles and .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifles , were sold and \u201c walked \u201d into Mexico , but the ATF lost track of them .\nThe operation , which began in September 2009 , was shut down only after U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry was shot and killed during a December 2010 gunfight with Mexican bandits at an isolated location near the Mexican border , south of Tucson . Two weapons found at the site of the Terry killing later were traced to the Fast and Furious operation .\n\u201c The Terry family appeared before the committee on June 15 , 2011 , to ask for answers about the program that put guns in the hands of the men who killed their son and brother , \u201d Mr. Issa said . \u201c Having been stonewalled for months by the attorney general and his senior staff , the committee issued a subpoena for the documents that would provide the Terry family with the answers they seek . \u201d\nThat subpoena was issued on Oct. 12 , 2011 , and while the Justice Department has said it has handed over 7,600 records involving Fast and Furious , Mr. Issa said the department has identified \u201c 140,000 pages of documents and communications responsive to the committee \u2019 s subpoena . \u201d\nWhite House Spokesman Eric Schultz dismissed the letter , saying Mr. Issa \u2019 s analysis of executive privilege has \u201c as much merit as his absurd contention that Operation Fast and Furious was created in order to promote gun control. \u201d He said Mr. Obama \u2019 s privilege claim was consistent with executive branch legal precedent set over the past three decades .", "Nearly a half century ago , young Donald Trump\u2014a Wharton graduate , and an avid player of squash , football , and tennis\u2014scored a 1-Y medical deferment . Hundreds of thousands of young men were being deployed to Vietnam . Trump had some bone spurs . He then limped happily into his father \u2019 s real-estate business without delay .\nWhen Trump was interviewed by the Times about his deferment during the 2016 campaign , he admitted that the foot condition was \u201c temporary \u201d and \u201c minor \u201d \u2014usually orthotics or stretching eased the pain\u2014and yet , \u201c I had a doctor that gave me a letter\u2014a very strong letter on the heels. \u201d He promised the paper that he would look for the letter . Amazingly , it never turned up . Later , however , his unforgettable physician , Dr. Harold N. Bornstein , assured the nation that Trump , if elected , \u201c will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency . \u201d\nOn Wednesday morning , the Commander-in-Chief declared by tweet-fiat that , \u201c after consultation with my Generals and military experts , \u201d he had decided to reverse an Obama Administration decision and bar transgender individuals from serving in the military \u201c in any capacity. \u201d Trump tweeted further , \u201c Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming . . . victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . \u201d\nLet \u2019 s begin with the retrograde cruelty .

Imagine the scale of this insult .\nHowever , today \u2019 s outrage\u2014they seem to come at least once daily\u2014is not merely one that reflects on Trump \u2019 s low character . It also reveals yet another layer of his political cynicism , and his willingness to use any tactical means available to try to emerge whole from his current predicament .\nThe President is in the midst of a colossal scandal , and the country , to an increasing measure , knows it . It \u2019 s not merely a matter of poor popularity polls . A sizable portion of the country wants to be rid of him and suspects he is unworthy of his office . Six months into his Presidency , according to a USA Today/Media Ethics poll , the country is split on whether or not he should be impeached , with forty-two per cent on either side of the question . The scandal is broad-based , but it surely includes ( but is not limited to ) contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and potential collusion to undermine the Clinton campaign ; the constant lying about same ; the firing of James Comey ; the threats to fire Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller ; the appalling vulgarity of his public performances ( cf . the \u201c Playboy After Dark \u201d speech before the Boy Scouts of America ) ; the accumulating evidence of a history of sleazy business practices and partners ; and the level of sheer incompetence in the West Wing .\nIt is implausible that Trump paid much attention to his highest-ranking generals , or to experts , generally ; Secretary of Defense James Mattis has supported transgender individuals joining the military . And the hardly radical Rand Corporation has published an in-depth study refuting the idea that transgender soldiers are somehow expensive , or that they undermine the morale and cohesion of the military over all . Trump \u2019 s decision to bar transgender people from the military is pure politics , cheap and cruel politics , a naked attempt to divert attention from his woes , to hold on to support from his base\u2014a base that he believes will cheer his latest attempt to do battle with the secular-humanist coastal \u00e9lites who are so obsessed with identity politics . ( One Administration official told Axios \u2019 s Jonathan Swan that the move was intended to force Democrats from Rust Belt states to take \u201c complete ownership of this issue. \u201d ) In other words , it is a decision straight out of the Steve Bannon playbook . Cue the organs of the alt-right press .\nTrump likes to declare what a \u201c disaster \u201d the military is , how deeply it has fallen into disrepair , and how he will be its salvation . When you begin to consider the meanness of what Trump has done , it is worth remembering him saying that he was \u201c smarter \u201d than the generals on military matters , and that he mocked John McCain \u2019 s service in Vietnam because \u201c I like people who weren \u2019 t captured. \u201d When you begin to think about the scale of this offense , it is worth remembering Khizr Khan , the Gold Star father who lost a son in Iraq , addressing Trump directly from the lectern of the Democratic National Convention : \u201c You have sacrificed nothing and no one . \u201d", "A Pentagon official signaled Wednesday that the U.S. is pressing the Turkish government to intervene in support of Kurdish forces desperately battling to keep the Syrian border town of Kobani from falling into Islamic State hands .\nPentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told Fox News that U.S. officials are talking with the Turks about `` what they can or will or may do here . ''\nHe added : `` This is a decision the Turkish government has to make . We ca n't make it for them . ''\nAt a press briefing later in the day , Kirby clarified that the United States is not `` making demands of the Turks , '' but hopes they will `` contribute what they can . ''\nThe situation in the town of Kobani has intensified , and with it concerns over whether partners on the ground are doing enough .\nThe New York Times reported earlier that the White House is growing frustrated with Turkish inaction as the situation next door in Kobani gets worse .\nKirby also stressed the `` limits of airpower '' and said the U.S. needs more help on the ground .\n`` There 's just so much you can do from the air , '' he told Fox News . `` You 've got to have willing partners on the ground . You 've got to have ground forces . ''\nThe New York Times quoted a senior administration official who slammed the Ankara government for `` dragging its feet to act to prevent a massacre less than a mile from its border . ''\n`` After all the fulminating about Syria 's humanitarian catastrophe , they 're inventing reasons not to act to avoid another catastrophe , '' the official continued . `` This is n't how a NATO ally acts while hell is unfolding a stone 's throw from their border . ''\nThe Times reported that Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu multiple times over the prior 72 hours in an effort to resolve tensions between the two sides .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the U.S.-led coalition 's air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the Islamic State group 's advance . Turkish troops have been massed near the border since the assault on Kobani began , but have so far not taken an offensive posture .\n`` Kobani is about to fall , '' Erdogan told Syrian refugees in the Turkish border town of Gaziantep , according to The Associated Press . The Turkish president called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition , which is fighting both the extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad .\n`` We asked for three things : one , for a no-fly zone to be created ; two , for a secure zone parallel to the region to be declared ; and for the moderate opposition in Syria and Iraq to be trained and equipped . ''\nThe Times reported that President Obama prefers that Erdogan not tether the fight against Islamic State , commonly known as ISIS , to the effort to overthrow Assad . U.S. officials also tell the paper that Erdogan 's demand for a no-fly zone against the Syrian Air Force is meaningless on the grounds that the airstrikes have created a no-fly zone in all but name .\nThe call for a buffer zone inside Syria was , meanwhile , prompting confusion . Top diplomats from the U.S. and Britain said Wednesday they would consider supporting one to help protect Turkey 's borders , but a Pentagon spokesman said that is not an option that is currently on the table . Asked about a buffer zone after an hour-long meeting in Washington , Kerry and visiting British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond both stopped short of embracing one .\nOn Wednesday , Fox News reported that machine gun and small arms fire could be heard and seen near Kobani , indicating street fighting at close quarters . Artillery fire could also be heard at the center of town . The minaret of the town 's mosque was destroyed by ISIS fire .\nU.S. Central Command said Tuesday that five airstrikes on ISIS positions had been carried out near Kobani . A Fox News crew witnessed at least two airstrikes . One strike hit an ISIS tank on a hillside overlooking the town , while another two tanks appeared to be hit to the town 's southwest .\nWhile it is thought that supply lines for ISIS might have been disrupted by the stepped up attacks , enough ISIS fighters have entered the town with heavy arms back-up to wage a serious fight .\nOn Tuesday , the United Nations envoy for Syria issued a call for `` concrete action '' to prevent `` humanitarian tragedies . ''\n`` The world has seen with its own eyes the images of what happens when a city in Syria or in Iraq is overtaken by the terrorist group called ISIS or Da'esh : massacres , humanitarian tragedies , rapes , horrific violence , '' Staffan De Mistura said . `` The international community can not sustain another city falling under ISIS .\n`` The world , all of us , will regret deeply if ISIS is able to take over a city which has defended itself with courage but is close to not being able to do so , '' De Mistura added . `` We need to act now .

Bowe Berdahl over the weekend , the circumstances surrounding the release \u2014 and the sudden freeing of five Taliban figures held at the Guantanamo detainee prison \u2014 were producing a full-scale controversy in Washington .\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel insisted the U.S. did not negotiate with terrorists in the process of exchanging the transfer of the five terrorism suspects for the release of Sgt . Bergdahl , now 28 , who had been in Taliban hands since June 2009 .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t negotiate with terrorists , \u201d Mr. Hagel said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c And I said and explained before , Sgt . Bergdahl is a prisoner of war . That \u2019 s a normal process in getting your prisoners back . \u201d\nSgt . Bergdahl arrived at a U.S. military hospital in Germany Sunday after he was handed over to U.S. special operations forces by the Taliban Saturday , with the government of Qatar serving as a go-between .\nIn an emotional press conference Sunday afternoon in Boise , Idaho , Sgt .

Rice told CNN that what officials did was ensure that the United States doesn \u2019 t leave a man or woman on the battlefield .\n\u201c And in order to do this \u2014 it \u2019 s very important for folks to understand , if we got into a situation where we said , you know , because of who has captured an American soldier on the battlefield , we will leave that person behind , we would be in a whole new era for the safety of our personnel and for the nature of our commitment to our men and women in uniform , \u201d Ms. Rice said . \u201c So [ just ] because the Taliban had him did not mean that we had any less of an obligation to bring him back . \u201d\nBut complicating the administration \u2019 s narrative was a rare public statement Sunday from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , who said the prisoner swap marked a \u201c great victory \u201d for the Islamist movement that led the military resistance against the U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan for more than a decade .\n\u201c The sacrifice of our mujahedeen have resulted in the release of our senior leaders from the hand of the enemy , \u201d Mullah Mohammed Omar said .\nMs. Rice and other administration officials insisted that , at the diplomatic level , the U.S. was negotiating with the government of Qatar , not the Taliban or its Afghan allies . But the handover followed secret and indirect negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban , and Qatar is taking custody of five of the Afghan detainees that had been held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .\nThe detainees are believed to be the most senior Afghans still held at the prison : Abdul Haq Wasiq , Mullah Norullah Nori , Khairullah Khairkhwa , Mohammed Nabi and Mohammad Fazl . Mr. Obama \u2019 s efforts to close the detainee site have been frustrated by opposition from both parties in Congress .\nRepublican critics Sunday criticized both the abrupt manner in which the Taliban prisoners were traded \u2014 with almost no advance warning to lawmakers \u2014 and the potential precedent the deal could set in dealing with other terrorist enemies .\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. \u201c Buck \u201d McKeon said that the released detainees are \u201c five very dangerous guys that should not leave Guantanamo [ and ] should not have the opportunity to get back into this fight . \u201d\n\u201c And now we have set a precedent \u2014 the president has set a precedent , \u201d the California Republican said Sunday on CNN . \u201c You know , he has violated the law and flouted the Constitution so many times . We have real concerns about this . They \u2019 re not following the law . They know they \u2019 re not following the law . \u201d\nAdded Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , speaking on ABC News , \u201c What does this tell terrorists \u2014 that if you capture a U.S. soldier you can trade that soldier for five terrorists ? \u201d\nSen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said the administration assured him just six months ago they would not consider the release of the leaders without consulting Congress .\n\u201c The security assurances the United States has been given regarding these terrorists is feeble at best , and I fear it is only a matter of time before they resume their terrorist activities , \u201d he said . \u201c These men are not soldiers ; they are dangerous terrorists , and President Obama should be treating them as such . \u201d\nBut Idaho \u2019 s all-Republican congressional delegation hailed the move . Rep. Raul R. Labrador told the Boise Weekly he was \u201c thrilled \u201d by the news , while Sen. Mike Crapo said that \u201c our prayers have been answered . \u201d\nMr. Hagel acknowledged that the law now mandates that the defense secretary give at least 30 days \u2019 notice for such prison transfers but that officials moved under the timeline they did in order to save Sgt . Bergdahl \u2019 s life .\n\u201c We had information that his health could be deteriorating rapidly , \u201d he said . \u201c There was a question about his safety . We found an opportunity . We took that opportunity . I \u2019 ll stand by that decision . I signed off on the decision . The president made the ultimate decision . We did spend time looking at this . \u201d\nMs. Rice said the sergeant \u2019 s situation was \u201c acute \u201d and said the administration would have been criticized if it had failed to act when a deal materialized .\n\u201c We did not have 30 days to wait , \u201d she said . \u201c And had we waited and lost him , I don \u2019 t think anybody would have forgiven the United States government . \u201d\nMr. Hagel added that he will not agree to the release of any more detainees from Guantanamo unless the country can be assured \u201c that we can sufficiently mitigate any risk to America \u2019 s security . \u201d\nSgt . Bergdahl was captured under murky circumstances in eastern Afghanistan on June 30 , 2009 , about two months after arriving in the country , but neither Mr. Hagel nor Ms. Rice specifically addressed how that happened .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll have the opportunity eventually to learn what has transpired in the past years , but what \u2019 s most important now is his health and well-being , that he have the opportunity to recover in peace and security and be reunited with his family , which is why this is such a joyous day , \u201d Ms. Rice said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\nAn annual event called \u201c Bring Bowe Back \u201d in his hometown of Hailey , Idaho , scheduled for June 28 was quickly renamed \u201c Bowe Is Back . \u201d\n\u201c It is going to be Bowe \u2019 s official welcome-home party even if he \u2019 s not quite home yet , \u201d organizer Stefanie O \u2019 Neill said .\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports .", "US President Donald Trump says transgender people can not serve in `` any capacity '' in the military .\nHe tweeted that he had consulted with military experts and cited `` tremendous medical costs and disruption '' .\nThe Obama administration decided last year to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military .\nBut in June , Defence Secretary James Mattis agreed to a six-month delay in the recruitment of transgender people .\nAs is often the case , the announcement came in a series of tweets .\nMr Trump said : `` After consultation with my Generals and military experts , please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military .\n`` Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . ''\nBut the measure will not go into effect immediately , as spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing .\nThe implementation policy has to be worked out , she said when asked if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back to the United States .\nThis was `` a military decision '' said Mrs Sanders , adding that it is `` not meant to be anything more than that '' .\nThe timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself .\nWhy now ? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch , the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign , the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill , perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side .\nRepublicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals . As one White House insider acknowledged , this is straight out of that playbook . While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights , he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now , more than ever .\nOr perhaps , as Politico is reporting , the White House sought to resolve an intraparty dispute that threatened passage of a key military spending bill in the House of Representatives . That the president chose to do so suddenly , with little advanced notice , would not be out of the ordinary for this administration .\nThe president 's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development . This is a fight the White House will welcome .\nThe independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender , although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000 .\nRand also predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would cause a 0.13 % increase in healthcare spending ( approximately $ 8.4m ) .\nA Military Times analysis found that the Department of Defense spends five times that figure just on erectile dysfunction drug Viagara alone .\nThe Obama administration 's move to allow transgender people in the military to serve openly was announced in June 2016 by then Defence Secretary Ash Carter .\nThe policy included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender .\nTransgender people would be permitted to join the services , so long as they could demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months .\nThis was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months . The Pentagon said the five branches of the military needed more time to `` review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces '' .\nWhile Mr Trump 's decision concerns transgender military personnel , the US military 's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemen and women - known as `` Do n't ask do n't tell '' - was lifted in 2011 .\nLGBTQ campaign group , GLAAD , called Mr Trump 's move `` a direct attack on transgender Americans '' .\nAaron Belkin , director of the Palm Centre , a leading think-tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military , told the BBC that Mr Trump 's decision would force transgender troops to in effect live as gays and lesbians did under `` Do n't ask , do n't tell '' .\nKristin Beck , a retired elite Navy SEAL , issued a challenge to President Trump in an interview with Business Insider : `` Let 's meet face to face and you tell me I 'm not worthy . ''\nShe said that during her decorated military career , she had been `` defending individual liberty '' .\n`` Being transgender does n't affect anyone else , '' she said . `` We are liberty 's light . If you ca n't defend that for everyone that 's an American citizen , that 's not right . ''\nFormer Defence Secretary Carter released a critical statement : `` To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military . There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honourably . ''\nChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Republican John McCain , said major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter and continued :\n`` The statement was unclear . The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military , and many are serving honorably today .\nAny American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving . ''\nSeveral British military generals have condemned Mr Trump 's decision , including the commander of the UK Maritime Forces , Rear Admiral Alex Burton .\n`` As an @ RoyalNavy_LGBT champion and senior warfighter I am so glad we are not going this way '' , he wrote on Twitter , later adding : `` We have a justifiably rigorous selection process but it does n't include discrimination and we 're a better fighting force for it . ''\nRepublican opponents of transgender people serving in the military include Vicky Hartzler , a congresswoman from Missouri , who wants transgender service members honourably discharged .\nSome oppose the military having to bear medical costs associated with transgender recruits , such as gender reassignment .\nTony Perkins of the socially conservative Family Research council said : `` Our troops should n't be forced to endure hours of transgender 'sensitivity ' classes and politically correct distractions . ''\nTrump supporter and political commentator Scott Presler is among those who disagree with the military carrying the cost of such interventions .\nWhile disagreeing with the ban , he added that `` generals know more about war than I do .\n`` I am cognisant that they understand what it takes to go to war ... I do n't think this is an attack on the LGBT community .\n`` I 'm mixed , but I have confidence in the guidance that President Trump is receiving , '' he said . `` I do n't think for a second he 's prejudiced .

John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary , said in a statement . The military said the new strikes are in keeping with the Pentagon 's mission to support humanitarian operations and protect U.S. personnel .\n`` We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam , which remains under control of Iraqi security forces , with support from Sunni tribes , '' Kirby said .\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the dam is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to the country 's powers system .\n`` Destruction of the dam or release of water would create a level of flooding that would potentially pose a catastrophic threat to thousands of Iraqis , '' she said in a statement .\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel , speaking in Georgia where he 's meeting with government and defense officials , however , rejected the suggestion that the strikes open a new front in the war against the Islamic State or that they represent an escalation of U.S. military operations , according to the Associated Press .\nThe announcement comes after President Obama said Friday the United States was prepared to `` take the fight '' to the militant group , which threatens to destabilize the region and could present a threat to the West .\nA mix of fighters and bombers conducted four airstrikes Saturday to help defend the dam , U.S. Central Command said . The strikes destroyed five Humvees , one armed vehicle , a checkpoint and damaged a bunker , according to the command .\nThe new strikes represent the first shift toward targets in western Iraq , a largely Sunni region that is currently a patchwork of conflicting loyalties .\nSome Sunnis have supported the Islamic State as a bulwark against the Shiite-dominated government . But tribes have taken different stands in the face of the militant offensive . Some tribes are fighting against the militants and others are supporting the Islamic State or are remaining neutral .\nTribes in the Haditha dam region have been fighting against the militants for months . The U.S. military said the dam remains in the hands of tribes working in support of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces .\nThe U.S. air campaign began Aug. 8 and has slowly expanded as it has taken on more missions . U.S. planes have pounded targets around the Mosul Dam , allowing a combination of Iraqi counterterrorist forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters to take the facility back from Islamic State militants .\nU.S. aircraft also targeted militants around Mount Sinjar , where a religious minority had taken refuge after militants had overrun their community . More recently , U.S. aircraft also helped break the siege of Amerli , a Shiite Turkmen town .\nThe U.S. military has conducted 138 airstrikes in Iraq since the air campaign began .", "Story highlights Ex-Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill says he fired shots that killed Osama bin Laden\nO'Neill says he 's concerned he 'll face prosecution for publicly telling his story\nHe says value of sharing details with families of 9/11 attack victims makes risk worthwhile\nThe Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden says he is worried the Pentagon might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the May 2011 raid on the al Qaeda leader 's compound in Pakistan .\nBut Robert O'Neill said the value of sharing the details of the mission for the families of the September 11 , 2001 , victims and military veterans killed in the ensuing wars makes that risk worthwhile .\n`` I think I did this in a way that does n't violate any tactics or any rules , '' he said in an interview on CNN 's `` The Lead '' with Jake Tapper .\nBeing prosecuted , he said , `` does concern me , and if it comes up , I 'll address it .

He said it was the first time he 'd really spoken about the mission , and that men and women cried and told him `` it was closure for them .

The head Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ) , one of the world \u2019 s biggest pharmaceutical companies , quit a presidential business panel as a result , saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism .\nThe chief executives of two other prominent companies - sportswear manufacturer Under Armour ( UAA.N ) and semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) - followed suit hours later .\nCritics denounced Trump for waiting too long to address the bloodshed , and for initially faulting hatred and violence \u201c on many sides , \u201d rather than singling out the white supremacists widely seen as instigating the melee .\nDemocrats said Trump \u2019 s reaction belied a reluctance to alienate white nationalists and \u201c alt-right \u201d political activists who occupy a loyal segment of Trump \u2019 s political base .

He said they also realized they had the ability to answer that question \u2014 using official coronavirus case counts and the anonymous , aggregated cell phone data that has become the gold standard for tracking societal shifts in movement .\nThe team worked quickly and published their findings earlier this month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper \u2014 meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed .\n\u201c I \u2019 m someone who likes to get the answers out , \u201d Friedson said . \u201c There are a lot of people who say , \u2018 Well I think it should happen or I think this should happen , \u2019 and it \u2019 s nice to have some numbers to inform these decision-making processes . \u201d\nThe paper comes as officials in Colorado and other states are concerned about rising infections , especially among young people .\nNew infections among young people have contributed significantly to Colorado \u2019 s uptick in cases in recent days \u2014 a rise that reversed a weeks-long trend of falling case numbers and has put Colorado back onto the list of potential coronavirus problem spots .

Instead , he said the research took the bigger-picture view : What did the protests mean for overall transmission of the virus within the entire community ?\nThe study looked at 315 American cities with populations of more than 100,000 and found that 281 of those cities saw protests . The remaining 34 cities that did not see protests \u2014 which , at the time , included Aurora \u2014 were used as a control group against which to measure the impact of the protests .\nThe researchers found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred \u2014 and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence .\nProtesters in Denver \u2019 s Capitol Hill neighborhood on Saturday , June 6 , 2020 . ( Jesse Paul . \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nFriedson said he and his colleagues were a bit surprised at first . The protests in many cities , including Denver , were massive , drawing tens of thousands of people out to march . But they occurred in cities with hundreds of thousands to millions of residents .\n\u201c We started thinking about it a little more and we thought , \u2018 Oh my gosh we \u2019 re capturing everybody else , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe paper also found that , with greater social distancing , COVID case growth slowed in cities with protests from what would be expected \u2014 but not by a statistically significant amount . There may be other explanations for the trends , the study \u2019 s authors note . Overall , though , they say the data show that any resurgence in coronavirus cases can \u2019 t be pinned entirely on the protests .\n\u201c Public speech and public health did not trade off against each other in this case , \u201d the authors wrote in the paper .\nBut Friedson said there is one last important thing to keep in mind about this study : It \u2019 s not a green light for governments to fully reopen bars , concert venues and other places where people gather in large numbers . The key to the researcher \u2019 s conclusions is that the protests , while receiving lots of support , were ultimately things most people decided to avoid . That \u2019 s not true of many other large gatherings .\n\u2018 An outdoor wedding doesn \u2019 t generate avoidance behavior ; we \u2019 re measuring avoidance behavior , \u201d Friedson said . \u201c People don \u2019 t say , \u2018 Oh man , there \u2019 s an outdoor wedding next door , we should stay home . \u2019 \u201d\nOur articles are free to read , but not free to report Support local journalism around the state .\nBecome a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588 today ! $ 5/month $ 20/month $ 100/month One-time Contribution", "Here \u2019 s something everyone knows : Social media is driving American politics into a ditch of partisanship . Political junkies log on and cocoon themselves in a bubble of friendly punditry , appealing fake news , and outrageous acts from the other side . Every retweet and every like is another moment of identity confirmation , another high five to our friends , another reminder that we \u2019 re right and they \u2019 re wrong .\nThe result is , well , this ugly mess \u2014 President Donald Trump , red and blue Americas , polls showing we fear and hate the other party more than ever before , conspiracy theories growing like weeds , a polity where agreement is impossible and everyone is angry . Damn you , Facebook ! Curse you , Twitter ! ( Instagram , you \u2019 re cool . )\nBut what if this obvious analysis is wrong ? What if social media isn \u2019 t driving rising polarization in American politics ?\nThat \u2019 s the conclusion of a new paper by Levi Boxell , Matthew Gentzkow , and Jesse Shapiro . Their study , released recently through the National Bureau of Economic Research , tests the conventional wisdom about polarization on social media nine ways from Sunday and finds that it \u2019 s wrong , or at least badly incomplete .\nTheir approach is simple . Using data from the American National Election Survey , they compare the most web-savvy voters ( the young , where 80 percent used social media in 2012 ) and the least web-savvy voters ( the old , where fewer than 20 percent used social media in 2012 ) on nine different tests of political polarization . The measures cover everything from feelings about political parties to ideological consistency to straight-ticket voting , and the data shows how polarization changed among these groups between 1996 and 2012 .\nThe results ? On fully eight of the nine measures , \u201c polarization increases more for the old than the young. \u201d If Facebook is the problem , then how come the problem is worst among those who don \u2019 t use Facebook ?\nTo be thorough , Boxell , Gentzkow , and Shapiro also construct panels based on internet access and find much the same thing \u2014 polarization is accelerating fastest among those using the internet the least :\nDoes this mean the internet isn \u2019 t making us more polarized ? Not necessarily . The young are becoming more polarized , and it \u2019 s possible social media is part of the reason . But given that older Americans who don \u2019 t use social media are polarizing faster than younger Americans who do , it \u2019 s clear that this is about more than whom you follow on Twitter .\n\u201c Something has to explain the rising polarization of older Americans , \u201d says Gentzkow , an economist at Stanford . \u201c We don \u2019 t argue against the view that social media is important . It \u2019 s just not the whole picture . \u201d\nI asked Gentzkow what he thinks might be part of the fuller picture . \u201c I have two main hypotheses , \u201d he replied . \u201c One is stuff that has nothing to do with media at all but is structural , like increasing income inequality . The second is non-digital media , and cable TV and talk radio in particular . \u201d\nThe latter piece makes particular sense if you think about the fact that older Americans make up the base of both the cable and talk radio audiences . More than a third of talk radio listeners are over age 65 , and half of Fox News \u2019 s audience is over age 68 . As bad as getting your news from Facebook can be , it \u2019 s often far better than relying on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh .\nThe authors \u2019 data only goes until 2012 , so it can \u2019 t tell us much about the 2016 election . But even though Trump \u2019 s use of Twitter was remarkable , my guess is the main way it mattered was by setting the agenda for more traditional news outlets , particularly cable news and talk radio . Remember , it was seniors \u2014 only 6 percent of whom use Twitter \u2014 who pushed Trump to the White House . He won 53 percent of voters ages 65 and over , but only 37 percent of voters ages 29 and younger . Trump is the Twitter-using president , not the president chosen by Twitter \u2019 s users .\nSocial media is new , it is transformative , and it is certainly changing American politics . But it \u2019 s not the only force at play , nor even the main one . And while it \u2019 s hard for news junkies ( myself included ) to remember , most people \u2019 s media feeds tilt more toward baby pictures , wedding announcements , and funny videos than political punditry . Those of us who follow lots of politicians and politicized news sources are outliers , and we shouldn \u2019 t extrapolate too much from our weird experience .\nWhatever is tearing our politics apart is deeper and more universal than the digital filter bubbles that get so much attention \u2014 and it seems to be most powerful among the people least likely to get their news from social media .", "Unfortunately , there is no Uncle Sam-sponsored miracle cure that can solve a problem at the root of our nation \u2019 s government .\nPolitical polarization is harming the effectiveness of the federal government and our ability to solve problems .\nYou could spin a wheel and pick almost any topic under the sun \u2014 immigration , Planned Parenthood , religious liberty and the federal deficit to name a few \u2014 and find insane comments made about it from the left and right wings of the issue .\nAll of these , and many more , are critical issues that affect almost all of us . Yet there is no approachable middle ground to be found in America today .\nA Pew Research Center survey from 2014 found that we as Americans are more polarized than we have been at any point in the last two decades .\n92 percent of Republicans are more conservative than the average Democrat , which is up from 70 percent in 2004 . And 94 percent of Democrats are more liberal than the average Republican , up from 68 percent of the same year .\nWhile it \u2019 s no surprise that Democrats are more liberal than Republicans are , it \u2019 s disappointing to see that each party is now more entrenched within its own views than it ever has been before .\nSo far , very few of the candidates running for president can boast that they have successful bipartisan leadership experience to bring to the table .\nWhile Hillary Clinton did work with congressional Republicans during her tenure as first lady and as a senator from New York , too often her messages towards Republicans have been negative and accusatory .\nHowever , the Republicans themselves are definitely not blameless either . Their current front-runner , businessman Donald Trump , has been characterized by many political figures as being a bully for his remarks towards Democrats and other politicians .\nWho can we look to provide positive examples of cooperation ?\nWe need more leaders like Jon Huntsman , Tom Davis and Richard Lugar , who represented our great state for a total of 36 years .\nWhile each of these political figures might lean more towards one side than the other , they are not afraid to reach across divided aisle ways to find common sense solutions to problems .\nEach of these politicians have served under both Democratic and Republican presidents . They have voted for bills that were crafted by the opposing party , and sometimes they even helped create bills with people from the opposite side of Congress .\nThey are also not motivated to see how popular they can get on cable news or social media .\nThey have ideas , they have experience and they have a vision to get things done . And that \u2019 s what brings them together .\nI \u2019 d like to see the talking heads on any cable network be able to do that .\nLike what you 're reading ?

Their party has been on a roll since 2005 , when the botched Social Security reform , the slow bleed of the Iraq war , and Hurricane Katrina sent the Bush administration into a tailspin . The Democrats won the Congress the following year and the White House two years after that . And while they lost the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 , Democrats still had the advantage of retaining the White House , a president seemingly immune from criticism , the courts , the bureaucracy , and large portions of the media . The correlation of forces in Washington has weighed heavily in favor of the Democrats for a decade .\nNo longer . The election of Donald Trump has brought unified Republican government to Washington and overturned our understanding of how politics works . Or at least it should have done so . The Democrats seem not to understand how to deal with Trump and the massive change he is about to bring to the nation \u2019 s capital . During the general election they fell for the idea that Trump can be defeated by conventional means , spending hundreds of millions of dollars in negative television advertising and relying on political consultants beholden to whatever line Politico was selling on a given day . This strategy failed Trump \u2019 s Republican primary opponents , but Democrats figured that was simply because the GOP was filled with deplorables . It was a rationalization that would cost them .\nRepublicans control the House , the Senate , 34 governor \u2019 s mansions , and 4,100 seats in state legislatures . But Democrats act like they run Washington . Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s speech to the 115th House of Representatives was a long-winded recitation of the same liberal agenda that has brought her party to its current low . Give her points for consistency I guess . Chuck Schumer is just being delusional .\nSmarting from the failed nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , the Senate minority leader pledged to oppose Donald Trump \u2019 s nominee weeks before inauguration day . \u201c If they don \u2019 t appoint somebody good , \u201d he said on MSNBC , \u201c we \u2019 re going to oppose them tooth and nail. \u201d That would \u201c absolutely \u201d include keeping the seat held by the late Antonin Scalia empty , he said . \u201c We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice . \u201d\nI suppose it \u2019 s too much to expect a graduate of Harvard Law School to grasp the difference between majority and minority . Mitch McConnell was able to block Garland \u2019 s appointment because the Republicans controlled the Senate . The Democrats do not . And McConnell was able to hold his caucus together because he was on solid historical ground . Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s nomination of Abe Fortas as chief justice failed in the election year 1968 , and the so-called \u201c Biden Rule \u201d of 1992 stipulated no Supreme Court replacements during the last year of a presidency . Schumer himself , in a 2007 speech , expanded the waiting period to the final 18 months of a president \u2019 s term . Now , despite a record of calling on the Senate to confirm the president \u2019 s nominees \u2014 as long as the president is a Democrat \u2014 Schumer has adopted the strategy of no Supreme Court confirmations at all . How does he think President Trump will respond ? By caving ?\nAn attempt to filibuster the Scalia replacement may force McConnell to change the rules so that Supreme Court vacancies can be approved by a majority vote . And where would Democrats be then ? Not only will they have lost the Scalia seat , they will be completely vulnerable should another vacancy arise in the next two years . And Schumer has a reputation for political savvy .\nI don \u2019 t expect the Democrats to roll over for Trump . But I am surprised by their hysterics , and by their race to see who can be the most obnoxious to the new president .\nThe blanket opposition to President-elect Trump extends to his appointments at large . Democrats can thank Harry Reid for allowing executive-branch officials and lower-court judges to be approved by a majority vote . But the Washington Post reports that Schumer wants to prolong the confirmation process so that some Trump cabinet officials are not confirmed until March . The reason : \u201c Democrats have been troubled by a lack of personal disclosure by Cabinet choices that they say mirrors Trump \u2019 s refusal to disclose personal tax information during the presidential campaign. \u201d The presidential campaign that , in case the Democrats have forgotten , Trump won .\nReviving the issue of the tax returns makes little sense . It generates headlines but doesn \u2019 t move votes . And though it \u2019 s entirely possible that one or more of Trump \u2019 s nominees won \u2019 t be confirmed , I seriously doubt it . In every incoming administration there is a personal revelation or atrocious hearing that dooms a cabinet appointment . But hearings begin next week , whether Chuck Schumer likes it or not , and so far the quality of the opposition research against Trump \u2019 s picks has been remarkably blah .\n# related # Yes , the first duty of the opposition is to oppose . And I don \u2019 t expect the Democrats to roll over for Trump . But I am surprised by their hysterics , and by their race to see who can be the most obnoxious to the new president . They seem to have been caught off guard , to say the least , by their situation . Take for example their willingness to stand on a podium beside a sign that reads , \u201c Make America Sick Again. \u201d By embracing this message , such as it is , the Democrats associated not Trump but themselves with illness . Who on earth thought that was a good idea ?\nIt takes time to adjust . The Democrats may be counting on inertia and the media to slow the Republicans down and force them into a defensive crouch .

According to the Journal , finance records show Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe \u2019 s PAC gave $ 467,500 to Dr. Jill McCabe \u2019 s 2015 state Senate campaign .

He later was promoted to deputy after the campaign ended , assuming an oversight role in the Clinton email investigation .\nMcCabe apparently sought ethics guidance from the FBI and followed it , but his supervision of the email case was not seen as a potential conflict since Jill McCabe \u2019 s campaign was over and McAuliffe wasn \u2019 t directly involved in the email case .\nThe FBI \u2019 s \u201c Ethics and Integrity Program \u201d manual makes clear McCabe would have had to flag the connections to senior management , and the final decision would come in writing .\nIn the section prohibiting employees from participating in criminal investigations in certain cases where there \u2019 s a personal or political relationship , the manual says an exception would be if : `` The employee 's participation would not create an appearance of a conflict of interest to affect the public perception of the integrity of the investigation or prosecution . ''\nThe FBI , in a statement , confirmed that McCabe sought internal guidance \u201c to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest \u201d and when his wife chose to run , \u201c McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics , a process followed for the remainder of her campaign . During the campaign , he played no role , attended no events , and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind . \u201d\nA law enforcement official , though , acknowledged an optics issue \u2013 given that while McCabe was barred from investigations into Virginia politics , the donation did come from the Virginia governor .\nMcAuliffe and other state figures reportedly recruited Dr. McCabe to run in the first place , but a spokesman pushed back on any suggestion of impropriety .\nMcAuliffe \u201c supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator . This is a customary practice for Virginia governors\u2026 Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous , \u201d the spokesman told the Journal .\nMcCabe continues to be involved in the email investigation aftermath . He was recently asked to brief House oversight committee members on allegations \u2013 contained in newly released FBI files \u2013 that a State Department official offered a \u201c quid pro quo \u201d with the bureau in a bid to un-classify a particular server email .\nThe revelations in the Wall Street Journal report could dovetail with Donald Trump \u2019 s persistent claims that the Justice Department and FBI investigation into Clinton \u2019 s email use was compromised .

Case was hoping Congress would reinstate the benefit , and it did .\n`` I think coming to work every day is a gamble , but so far it 's been a good gamble , '' she says .\nDaniel Kunz runs U.S. Geothermal , a company that creates electricity from sources of superhot water that occur naturally underground . When it looked like Congress might not renew tax credits for renewable energy , his company shelved plans to expand one of its plants .\nBut then Congress not only extended the tax credit for renewable energy projects , it also changed the rules . Now , instead of needing to complete a project by the end of 2013 to be eligible , a company has to only start construction by the end of the year .\n`` In fact , this is going to help us make a decision , an economic decision , to go forward on a project that otherwise might not , '' Kunz says .\nThe tax benefits for green energy that Congress extended were originally created over the past decade . At the time , it seemed that energy sources , especially homegrown ones , were scarce . The country also seemed to be on the verge of setting limits on emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide .\n`` There was a sensible reason to want to subsidize a transformation , '' says energy analyst Kevin Book . It 's harder to make a case for renewable energy now , given the booms in natural gas and oil , he says .\n`` All of these things are different now : Demand is declining , supply is increasing , the decarbonization mandate has weakened if not disappeared , and energy security is n't the risk that it used to be , '' he says .\nBook predicts that the New Year 's tax package may be the last big payday for green energy .\nBut Kunz , of U.S. Geothermal , says the United States should keep investing in renewable energy .\n`` It will never be the cure-all energy source , but it is a gift to our children when we build these things to have clean energy sources , '' he says .\nThese projects will produce less pollution , including greenhouse gases . They also can save money over the long haul because , unlike , say , a natural gas power plant , they do n't need to keep buying fuel .", "Climate change , by nature , is a global problem . Each ton of carbon dioxide affects the climate , whether emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai . At the heart of the Paris Agreement in 2015 is a bargain among nations to nudge one another toward ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to stabilize global temperatures . The bargain also called on rich nations to help developing ones adapt . Now comes a test of the \u201c we \u2019 re in this together \u201d spirit . At the COP24 , this year \u2019 s United Nations climate summit , a key task is to firm up plans for developed nations to contribute more than $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to help other countries . \u201c [ The developed world ] has to take historical responsibility for this , \u201d says Nigerian climate official Peter Tarfa , noting the outsize emissions of industrialized nations . But the rationale is also pragmatic . More support translates into lower emissions in places with rising populations and aspirations for middle-class lifestyles . \u201c It \u2019 s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay , \u201d Dr. Tarfa says . It \u2019 s getting them \u201c to see the benefits of such action . \u201d\nIn 2015 , the Paris Agreement on climate change rallied the world \u2019 s nations around a sense of collective resolve , a spirit of \u201c We \u2019 re all in this together . \u201d\nLeaders embraced the idea that this global-scale problem requires ambitious action from every nation to cut greenhouse-gas emissions . They also agreed that wealthier nations should help finance the efforts of poorer ones .\nSome of that money has already started to flow . But a key moment has arrived . Three years later , it \u2019 s the appointed time to firm up plans to hit a $ 100-billion-a-year target for such international transfers by 2020 \u2013 and to expand this \u201c climate finance \u201d further from there .\nThe national and global initiatives are intertwined . Without help , developing nations will be less able to pursue ambitious targets for low-carbon economies . Officials from postcolonial and developing nations in the \u201c global south \u201d say industrialized nations should bring more money to the table \u2013 for everyone \u2019 s sake .\n\u201c If developed economies put off their climate payments any longer , the Paris Agreement temperature goals will slip out of reach , with tragic consequences for people and planet , '' J. Ant\u00f4nio Marcondes , chief negotiator for Brazil , writes in an email to the Monitor . \u201c These finance commitments were not mere ornaments to the Paris Agreement . They were fundamental elements in the balance of the Agreement which must be fully delivered for developed countries to meet their historical responsibilities , and for developing countries to reach an even higher gear . \u201d\nA higher gear may be vital . The outlook appears daunting on several fronts .\nThis week came news that , despite global efforts to date , the world \u2019 s greenhouse emissions continue to rise , driven especially by increases in China and India . Meanwhile , the United States under President Trump has backed away from its Paris climate commitments , and recent protests prompted the French government to cancel a gas tax designed to curb reliance on fossil fuels .\nStill , with all the challenges there \u2019 s also hope and a tangible sense of determined optimism in Katowice , Poland , at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , known for short as COP24 . The ethos of \u201c we \u2019 re in this together \u201d hasn \u2019 t died out .\n\u201c The expected commitments that we \u2019 re hearing from developed countries are all positive , \u201d says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz , director of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute think tank , speaking by phone from Poland . \u201c We do n't know yet what the numbers are going to be precisely , but we do know that there \u2019 s a collective sense that this has to be done . \u201d\nHe notes that , ahead of the summit for climate officials , Germany said it will contribute $ 1.7 billion to the Green Climate Fund for developing nations , nearly twice the support it gave the last time industrialized nations replenished that fund . That would push Germany toward the top tier of contributors , on a per capita basis .\nAnd the World Bank pledged this week to devote $ 200 billion over five years to help poorer nations develop their economies in climate-smart ways .\nTo some degree the Green Climate Fund is still earning the trust of donor and recipient nations alike . Some see room for the fund to make decisions both faster and with enhanced safeguards against misuse of the money .\nStill , there \u2019 s fairly wide support for the general concept behind the Green Climate Fund . The reasons voiced by officials and nongovernment organizations are both moral and pragmatic .\n\u201c The emissions come mostly from developed countries . If you look at the emissions produced by a small island in the Pacific , it 's almost zero , but the country can disappear because of rising sea levels , \u201d says Simon Wilson , head of communications at the Green Climate Fund .\n\u201c [ The developed world ] has to take historical responsibility for this , \u201d says Peter Tarfa , director of Nigeria \u2019 s Department of Climate Change .\nBut Mr. Wilson also notes the business opportunities for private-sector firms . And Dr. Tarfa also frames the the issue more broadly .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay , it \u2019 s a question of getting developed countries to see the benefits of such action and meeting their obligations , \u201d Tarfa says . Reduced emissions bring a benefit to the whole planet . And helping nations adapt to the effects of climate change can mean a reduction in conflict and forced migration .\nAkintunde Akinleye/Reuters/File A power official works on an electric pole along a street in Lagos , Nigeria 's commercial capital . Nigerian officials say that Green Climate Fund support will help the country to diversify energy sources to include more renewables as it moves to expand electricity access .\nNations like Nigeria don \u2019 t expect richer nations to pay for all their climate responses . But the needs are significant , and with aid they can do more .\n\u201c In Nigeria one of the major challenges is access to electricity . We would like to have more investments in clean sources of energy , \u201d Tarfa says . \u201c We also need environmentally friendly and affordable buildings , because the population is increasing dramatically . Other issues are clean transport and smart agriculture to maximize harvest . \u201d\nEach ton of carbon dioxide affects the global climate whether it was emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai . And increasingly the carbon pollution stems from developing economies where growing populations aspire to join the global middle class . Some say these economies , from Asia to Africa and Latin America , are also where each dollar invested can have the biggest effect .\n\u201c More support translates into more action , and that benefits the whole planet , \u201d says a spokesperson for Brazil \u2019 s climate delegation , via email , calling Brazil \u2019 s clean-energy aspirations \u201c transformational \u201d and \u201c cost efficient . \u201d\nThe vastness of the global task \u2013 slashing greenhouse emissions to stabilize global temperatures while also embracing the rise of a global middle class \u2013 brings complexity .\nHow much money is needed , and where ? For what kinds of investments ?\n\u201c We look at China , we think , \u2018 Oh they have all this money. \u2019 ... It \u2019 s kind of going through the Industrial Revolution on steroids , \u201d says Kate Gordon , an Oakland-based expert with Columbia University \u2019 s Center on Global Energy Policy . \u201c Sometimes we forget the scale of the challenge they \u2019 re facing to try to grow a middle class and grow a developed-country economy in a sustainable way . \u201d\nShe says \u201c the scale of doing that in China and India and other countries is bigger than the amount of money that they have to deal with it . \u201d\nEven when the general need is acknowledged , part of the challenge is building developed-nation commitment to climate finance .\nIn France , the recent protests by yellow-vested citizens revolved around a fuel tax with revenue going toward deficit reduction , leaving working-class citizens feeling penalized by a new burden on their finances . The uproar doesn \u2019 t mean that all action on climate change will be unpopular , but hints at how questions of fairness can be crucial .\n\u201c France points to the absolute need to think through the local impacts of macroeconomic policy , [ since ] ultimately climate policy is economic policy , \u201d says Ms. Gordon .\n\u201c There has to be a very careful political strategy to explain to the public why these initiatives and these efforts matter , both domestic and international , \u201d says Dr. Martinez-Diaz of the World Resources Institute . Canada has designed a carbon tax , he notes , so that it recycles revenue back to taxpayers , while giving incentives to move away from fossil fuels .\nClimate policymakers also need to ensure accountability in the process for distributing funds even as they try to scale up the dollar volume . The Green Climate Fund isn \u2019 t the only channel for climate finance . But it \u2019 s a major one , and has been designed with safeguards to ensure careful review of the projects that get funded .\nSo far its outflows toward climate projects are small \u2013 some $ 1.6 billion in commitments \u2013 compared with its longer term goals . But it \u2019 s active already in 96 nations .\n\u201c In Egypt ... [ our project is ] building the largest solar park in the world , \u201d says the Fund \u2019 s Mr. Wilson .\n\u201c We think that it is a good model where , at least in principle , decision-making ... ( through the Board ) relies on a system which gives equal voice to developing and developed countries , \u201d says Brice Boehmer of the Berlin-based watchdog group Transparency International , speaking via email . He sees room for the fund to add further safeguards , such as support for whistleblowers and \u201c consultation and participation of civil society . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

As Canada and Mexico have felt spurned by Trump during the runup to renegotiating NAFTA , China has emerged as a more reliable trading prospect .\nThis isn \u2019 t happening quietly behind the scenes : At China \u2019 s first appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Chinese President Xi Jinping chided the West for its flirtation with protectionism , and painted a picture of his country as a paragon of free trade and an inviting place for foreign investment .\nNow , as the US pulls out of the global community \u2019 s effort to curb carbon emissions , China \u2019 s profile as a forward-looking world leader will only grow . It \u2019 s set to become closer to the US \u2019 s allies that feel abandoned by Trump \u2019 s recent actions , as well as take a more aggressive lead in building a green economy .\n\u201c While the US is breaking these ties , China \u2014 which has traditionally been more reserved in international affairs \u2014 is building them at breakneck pace , \u201d Alex Wang , an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles , told me . \u201c As the US loses good will , China is building it . \u201d\nThe reshuffling of the world order in the wake of Trump \u2019 s announcement could be seen almost immediately , with top Chinese and European leaders criticizing the US \u2019 s withdrawal side by side on Thursday .\nStanding next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that \u201c fighting climate change is a global consensus \u201d and pledged that China would remain committed to the Paris agreement .\nMerkel said `` the cooperation of the European Union with China in this area will play a crucial role , especially in regards to new technologies . ''\nIn a statement to the press , Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete , the European Union commissioner on climate action and energy , made the point even more forcefully : `` No one should be left behind , but the EU and China have decided to move forward . Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit . Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action . \u201d\nIt won \u2019 t be the last time that Beijing and Brussels find themselves seeing eye to eye , or that the two sides look past the US and look to work on joint initiatives that don \u2019 t involve Washington . And Europe and China \u2019 s enhanced cooperation is quite likely to go beyond coordinating on climate change .\n\u201c These agreements ... build ties and align interests in ways that reduce the likelihood of conflict and bolster the opportunities for greater growth and development , \u201d Wang says .\nTo make that a little more concrete , let \u2019 s take something like China \u2019 s jaw-droppingly ambitious One Belt , One Road initiative . It \u2019 s a Chinese-funded infrastructure project designed to connect China to 64 countries in Asia , Europe , the Middle East , and Africa that make up around 60 percent of the world \u2019 s population .\nAs is often the case with countries that deal with trading with China , Europe has expressed concern about China \u2019 s compliance with global trade norms as Beijing goes about pitching its proposals for trains and tunnels . Those are big issues that aren \u2019 t easy to surmount , but they become a little bit easier to deal with when you \u2019 re able to build goodwill through cooperation on issues like climate change .\n\u201c As the US loses goodwill , China is building it \u201d \u2014Alex Wang\nIf Europe and China are actually able to grow closer through their coordination on climate change , it could potentially build a better relationship for navigating conflicts over trade .\nIn the meantime , the US and Europe are going through the roughest patch they \u2019 ve had since they split over the Iraq War in 2003 . Even before Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement on Thursday , he had already alienated Europe during his trip abroad last week , when he , among other things , refused to reaffirm America \u2019 s commitment to NATO and accused Germany of being a trade cheat .\nTrump \u2019 s America First agenda has been a huge gift to China\nBut the impact of Trump \u2019 s withdrawal from the world stage is bigger than China \u2019 s relationship with Europe .\nConsider how , on his first full working day as president , he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , an agreement that would \u2019 ve boosted trade ties between the US and 11 countries along the Pacific Rim and generated the largest trade bloc the world had ever seen .\nThe accord would have strengthened ties between the US and a number of China \u2019 s neighbors and would \u2019 ve served as a counterweight to Beijing \u2019 s increasing influence in the region ( China was n't part of the deal ) .\nNow , Trump \u2019 s move means that Beijing has a major opportunity to step into that vacuum and negotiate a regional trade deal that basically serves as a China-centric version of the TPP . It \u2019 s already been making efforts to do exactly that .\nChina has generally been eager to capitalize on Trump \u2019 s protectionist tendencies . In his World Economic Forum speech , Chinese President Xi warned against rising nationalism in the West and defended free trade . This is China lecturing the US and Europe about free trade . China \u2019 s economy has liberalized significantly in recent decades , but it \u2019 s a country that flagrantly disregards all kinds of global trade rules , from denying market access to foreign companies to subsidizing many of its key industries . But when you have the most powerful politician in the world calling for 45 percent tariffs against other countries , Xi doesn \u2019 t look so preposterous .\nIf there \u2019 s one realm where China is set to best the US in the wake of Paris , it \u2019 s in developing a sustainable economy . It \u2019 s already investing more than the US in clean energy \u2014 in 2016 , it invested more than $ 88 billion to the US \u2019 s $ 59 billion \u2014 but the gulf between the US and China will grow as the US decides that renewable energy investment isn \u2019 t a priority . And it will grow fast . America First is turning out to be anything but .", "All too many bad ideas get endlessly recycled \u2014 the carbon tax is one of them . A carbon tax could be a tax on coal , oil and gas carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants and other sources . Do you know how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere ? It is a little less than 400 parts per million . Do you know what the optimum level of carbon dioxide is ? No one does , even though some have the extreme conceit to think they do .\nThe earth \u2019 s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen , about 21 percent oxygen , less than 1 percent argon , and only 0.038 percent carbon dioxide \u2014 plus a variable amount of water vapor . The gas is necessary for life . Plants can not grow without it . They absorb it and release oxygen in exchange . Animals exhale carbon dioxide and inhale oxygen . There is evidence that as carbon-dioxide levels have risen , plants are growing faster , which means cheaper food .\nThe advocates of a carbon tax claim that the tax will help reduce dangerous emissions . The argument is that carbon dioxide is a \u201c greenhouse \u201d gas and , everything else being equal , more of it in the atmosphere will result in higher atmospheric temperatures . The operative phrase here is \u201c everything else being equal. \u201d When fossil fuels are burned , they produce small amounts of carbon dioxide but large amounts of water vapor . Increases in water vapor show up as more cloud cover . Clouds both trap heat ( which increases warming ) and reflect sunlight ( which reduces warming ) , but there is no consensus about which effect is greater .\nWhat is known with a high degree of certainty is that at times in the past , the Earth has been both warmer and cooler at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . What is also known is the current climate models have a dreadful record of prediction . Twenty years ago , we were told that the Earth \u2019 s temperatures would steadily rise from then on , yet there has been no average warming for the past 16 years \u2014 oops .\nLet \u2019 s assume for the moment that those who think that global warming is largely caused by increases in carbon dioxide , and that man has caused the increase , are correct . Those who think that also have a \u201c mainstream \u201d forecast of 3 degrees Celsius of global warming between now and the end of the century . At most , they also estimate that the U.S. contribution will only be about 0.2 degrees Celsius , or about 7 percent of global warming . Does it make sense for the United States to impose a carbon tax , when emissions from the rest of the world \u2014 notably , India and China \u2014 would be responsible for 93 percent of the temperature rise ? Even with very high taxes on carbon-dioxide emissions , the amount of warming that would be prevented is too small to measure on a 50-year time scale .\nA carbon tax has real costs to the American economy . Energy prices and food prices would be higher , and virtually everything else that people consume would cost more . The results of higher prices are a lower standard of living , less economic opportunity , lower real wages and fewer jobs . All for what ?\nYou may have noticed that people who have very strong empirical and theoretical evidence for their point of view usually do not feel a need to suppress dissent . Instead they let the strength of their own arguments and evidence persuade . Yet , the global-warming lobby increasingly exhibits the characteristics of an intolerant religious sect , rather than objective scientists . Rather than admitting that their climate models were flawed , many in the global-warming crowd have resorted to name-calling and active repression of those who have argued that solar activity or other phenomena might be more important than carbon dioxide in determining the earth \u2019 s temperature .\nAs an economist , I make no pretense to knowing what the optimum temperature of the earth ought to be and what the optimal level of carbon dioxide should be , other than to note , in general , people tend to prefer warmer over colder climates and less expensive and more plentiful food that comes from more warmth , moisture and carbon dioxide . As an economist , though , I am prepared to make judgments as to whether a proposed tax is likely to have more benefits than costs . Even many proponents of carbon taxes , when pressed , admit that they will have virtually no effect on global warming ( even using their very doubtful assumptions ) . However , we do know that these proposed tax increases will have very real negative effects on people \u2019 s incomes and job opportunities .\nMankind has adapted to the gradual ups and downs in temperatures and sea levels for thousands of years \u2014 without freedom-destroying government mandates and oppressive taxes . The carbon tax idea should be scrapped .\nRichard W. Rahn is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth .", "While touring areas of California ravaged by a historic drought , President Obama on Friday sounded an ominous warning and said that even if the federal government takes meaningful action to combat climate change , much of the damage already has been done .\n\u201c Unless and until we do more to combat carbon pollution that causes climate change , this trend is going to get worse , and the hard truth is even if we do take action on climate change , carbon pollution has built up in our atmosphere for decades . The planet is slowly going to keep warming for a long time to come , \u201d Mr. Obama said while touring a farm in Los Banos . \u201c We \u2019 re going to have to stop looking at these disasters as something to wait for . We \u2019 ve got to start looking at these disasters as something to prepare for , to anticipate . \u201d\nMr. Obama and many Democrats , along with their supporters in the environmental community , have held up extreme weather events such as California \u2019 s drought , Hurricane Sandy and others as proof that global warming is wreaking havoc all across the planet .\nBut the issue remains bitterly divisive , and many lawmakers believe Mr. Obama \u2019 s dire warnings are grossly overstated .\nThe heated debate over climate change has led to near gridlock on Capitol Hill , with Republicans and some Democrats standing in staunch opposition to major legislative proposals to address the issue . That opposition helped kill the controversial 2010 cap-and-trade bill , which would have put a limit on carbon emissions nationwide .\nIn lieu of congressional action , the Obama administration has taken a number of executive steps . The most notable were the ambitious automobile fuel standards , which call for American cars and trucks to average 54.5 mpg by 2025 , and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s strict new rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants .\nThe White House on Friday also announced that in the president \u2019 s new budget proposal , due out next month , Mr. Obama will ask Congress to create a new $ 1 billion \u201c climate resilience \u201d fund to spur new research into how communities and infrastructure can be better prepared for the impacts of climate change .\nThe initiative , if approved , also would fund new technologies \u201c that will make us more resilient in the face of changing climate , \u201d the White House said in a statement .\nMoving forward , the president said , such efforts will become more critical \u2014 especially in states such as California , which will have to deal with longer , more severe droughts and less water as the climate situation worsens .\n\u201c Everybody , from farmers to residential areas to the north of California and the south of California and every place in between , as well as the entire Western region , are going to have to start rethinking how we approach water for decades to come , \u201d the president said .\nWhile in California , the president also attended a town hall meeting with the state \u2019 s Democratic governor , Jerry Brown , Sens . Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein , both Democrats , and other state and local officials .\nMr. Obama will spend the rest of the weekend in California . Later on Friday , he \u2019 ll hold a bilateral meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan at a private retreat in Rancho Mirage .", "Unsustainable use of resources is wrecking the planet but recycling is falling , report finds\nThe amount of material consumed by humanity has passed 100bn tonnes every year , a report has revealed , but the proportion being recycled is falling .\nThe climate and wildlife emergencies are driven by the unsustainable extraction of fossil fuels , metals , building materials and trees . The report \u2019 s authors warn that treating the world \u2019 s resources as limitless is leading towards global disaster .\nThe materials used by the global economy have quadrupled since 1970 , far faster than the population , which has doubled . In the last two years , consumption has jumped by more than 8 % but the reuse of resources has fallen from 9.1 % to 8.6 % .\nThe report , by the Circle Economy thinktank , was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos . It shows that , on average , every person on Earth uses more than 13 tonnes of materials per year . But the report also found that some nations are making steps towards circular economies in which renewable energy underpins systems where waste and pollution are reduced to zero .\n\u201c We risk global disaster if we continue to treat the world \u2019 s resources as if they are limitless , \u201d said Harald Friedl , the chief executive of Circle Economy . \u201c Governments must urgently adopt circular economy solutions if we want to achieve a high quality of life for close to 10bn people by mid-century without destabilising critical planetary processes . \u201d\nMarc de Wit , the report \u2019 s lead author , said : \u201c We are still fuelling our growth in population and affluence by the extraction of virgin materials . We can \u2019 t do this indefinitely \u2013 our hunger for virgin material needs to be halted . \u201d\nTrump blasts 'prophets of doom ' in attack on climate activism Read more\nThe report found that 100.6bn tonnes of materials were consumed in 2017 , the latest year for which data is available . Half of the total is sand , clay , gravel and cement used for building , along with the other minerals quarried to produce fertiliser . Coal , oil and gas make up 15 % and metal ores 10 % . The final quarter are the plants and trees used for food and fuel .\nThe lion \u2019 s share of the materials \u2013 40 % \u2013 is turned into housing . Other major categories include food , transport , healthcare , communications , and consumer goods such as clothes and furniture .\nAlmost a third of the annual materials remain in use after a year , such as buildings and vehicles . But 15 % is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment , such as plastic in waterways and oceans . A third of the materials is treated as waste , mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps . Just 8.6 % is recycled .\n\u201c This report sparks an alarm for all governments , \u201d said Carolina Schmidt , Chile \u2019 s environment minister . \u201c We need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation [ to a circular economy ] . \u201d\nCristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said : \u201c The circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts , protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet . \u201d\nThe report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive , improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation . It reported that 13 European countries have adopted circular economy roadmaps , including France , Germany and Spain , and that Colombia became the first Latin American country to launch a similar policy in 2019 .\nChina \u2019 s ban on waste imports aims to encourage domestic recycling , the report said , but has also stimulated the development of circular economy strategies in Australia and other countries which previously exported their waste to China .\nJanez Poto\u010dnik , a former European environment commissioner and the co-chair of the UN Environment Programme international resource panel , said the world needed to learn to do more with less and replace ownership with sharing , as is increasingly being seen with cars .", "Employers hired more workers in March even as the number of job openings fell slightly , the Labor Department said Tuesday .\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey points to a stronger labor market two months ago than another government report suggested Friday .\nLabor said last week that employers added a net 85,000 jobs in March , including hiring and layoffs , as payroll growth sputtered amid frigid weather and a pullback in drilling by oil producers , among other factors . That was the lowest total since June 2012 . Job gains rebounded to 223,000 in April .\nTuesday 's JOLTS report provides a more granular view of employee movements and shows a more encouraging picture . The number of hires , for example , increased by 56,000 to about 5.1 million .\nHiring increased in retail , professional and business services , and leisure and hospitality . It declined in construction , manufacturing and education and health services .\nPart of the reason net job gains were weak is that layoffs and discharges also picked up , rising by 105,000 , or 6.2 % , to 1.8 million . At least some of those job cuts were in the oil industry , which continues to shed workers in response to low crude prices .\nMeanwhile , about 2.8 million Americans quit their jobs \u2014 the most since April 2008 \u2014 up from 2.7 million in February . A large number of quits is a sign of a dynamic labor market in which workers feel confident enough to leave one job for another .\nOverall , the report `` helps ease concerns that the weak 85,000 ( job gain total ) for March was the start of a new trend , '' says Barclays Capital economist Jesse Hurwitz . `` Confidence remains intact . ''\nLess encouraging is that job openings fell by 150,000 to 5 million after hitting a 14-year high in February . But economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase notes that openings were still up about 18 % from the year-ago period .\nAnother measure of the labor market 's progress is that there were 1.7 unemployed workers for each job opening in March , down sharply from a high of 6.7 in 2009 .\nThat shows the labor market is continuing to tighten , aiding job seekers , though at a slower pace than last year , Hurwitz says . He expects job gains to pick up to a solid monthly average of 200,000 to 225,000 for the rest of 2015 . That would mark an uptick from the 184,000 monthly pace in the first quarter but a slowdown from last year 's brisk clip of 260,000 .\nLast week , Labor said that employers added 223,000 jobs in April .", "President Obama \u2019 s relationship with blue-collar unions has hit an all-time low , with several powerful labor groups ripping into the administration \u2014 and the Democratic Party as a whole \u2014 for its rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and its promotion of the highly controversial trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s decision to reject Keystone on environmental grounds , which he announced Friday after a review process that lasted nearly seven years , deeply angered the president \u2019 s traditional supporters in the labor movement .\nIn addition to unprecedented verbal criticism of Mr. Obama \u2014 including from the Laborers \u2019 International Union or North America , which branded the president \u201c cowardly \u201d and his actions \u201c shameful \u201d \u2014 other unions hinted that they may rethink their support for Democrats in 2016 .\n\u201c President Obama has chosen to place politics over substantive policy that only serves to advance the agenda of well-funded radical environmentalists , \u201d Sean McGarvey , president of the North America \u2019 s Building Trades Unions , said in a statement Friday . \u201c All of which begs the question : Where does this leave the Democratic Party \u2019 s historical core constituency of working Americans ? We won \u2019 t know the answer to that question until November 2016 . But , to paraphrase Senator Ted Kennedy , for all those whose jobs have been our concern , the work goes on , the cause endures , and the dream shall never die , and hope springs again in January of 2017 . \u201d\nMr. Obama , who has tried to cultivate close ties with labor leaders throughout his time in the White House , now finds himself in a situation where his relationship with some major unions is tense at best and fatally wounded at worst . In addition to the lambasting the administration has taken over Keystone , it is enduring equal criticism on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , a major trade deal involving the U.S. and 12 Pacific Rim nations .\nThe full text of the deal , which is opposed by many key figures in the Democratic Party , including 2016 presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton , finally was released last week .\n\u201c Officials have talked about side deals and special arrangements that they say will improve the agreement , \u201d Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in a statement . \u201c But they are unenforceable and won \u2019 t help protect the jobs of hardworking Americans . That \u2019 s why there is only one right answer for lawmakers when it comes to TPP . Just say no . \u201d\nTeamsters also launched a # TPPWorseThanWeThought campaign on Twitter seeking to rally opposition to the deal within the Democratic Party .\nWhile the administration flat out rejects many criticisms of TPP \u2014 including that the deal \u2019 s labor standards aren \u2019 t strong enough \u2014 Mr. Obama took a slightly different tack when explaining why he blocked the Keystone pipeline .\nThe project \u2014 which would have crossed the U.S.-Canada boundary , connected with existing pipeline infrastructure and transported more than 800,000 barrels of Canadian oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast \u2014 would have created more than 40,000 jobs , according to State Department research . Supporters argue it would have greatly enhanced North American energy security and potentially would have lowered U.S. gas prices .\nBut the president , while also casting doubt on the true job-creation potential of Keystone , made clear that his chief motivation for killing the project is to prove to the world that America will voluntarily lessen its reliance on fossil fuels and lead the world in the fight against climate change .\n\u201c Today we \u2019 re continuing to lead by example , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a White House speech Friday , flanked by Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Secretary of State John F. Kerry . \u201c Because , ultimately , if we \u2019 re going to prevent large parts of this earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes , we \u2019 re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky . \u201d\nFrom the perspective of some unions , the president \u2019 s decision proves he \u2019 s more interested in securing an environmental legacy than he is in creating jobs and boosting the economy .\n\u201c After a seven-year circus of cowardly delay , the president \u2019 s decision to kill the Keystone XL pipeline is just one more indication of an utter disdain and disregard for salt-of-the-earth , middle-class working Americans , \u201d said Terry O \u2019 Sullivan , general president of the Laborers \u2019 International Union of North America .\n\u201c The politics he has played with their lives and livelihoods is far dirtier than oil carried by any pipeline in the world , and the cynical manipulation of the approval process has made a mockery of regulatory institutions and government itself . We are dismayed and disgusted that the president has once again thrown the members of LIUNA and other hard-working , blue-collar workers under the bus of his vaunted \u2018 legacy , \u2019 while doing little or nothing to make a real difference in global climate change . His actions are shameful . \u201d", "The recent economic upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unmatched by anything in recent memory . Social distancing has resulted in massive layoffs and furloughs in retail , hospitality , and entertainment , and millions of the affected workers\u2014restaurant servers , cooks , housekeepers , retail clerks , and many others\u2014were already at the bottom of the wage spectrum .\nThe economic catastrophe of the previous decade , the Great Recession , hit young adults and those with lower levels of education especially hard . As we approach another nationwide recession , we are about to see history repeat itself .\nMillions of young adult workers were economically vulnerable before COVID-19\nIn a pre-pandemic analysis , we identified 53 million low-wage workers in America who earn median hourly earnings of just $ 10.22 . Of these workers , a disproportionate share are young adults ages 18 to 24 : 13 million , or 24 % of all low-wage workers . These 13 million young adults are especially concentrated in industries that have been shuttered by stay-at-home and social distancing orders , and are likely to experience an outsized share of pandemic-related layoffs .\nFor some young people ( primarily those with a college degree ) , a low-wage job is a temporary waystation , and they are likely to advance to higher-paying work . Given the importance of education in the labor market , those without college credentials are not so well-situated , and future wage growth for them is much less likely . The current economic crisis may exacerbate these differences in outcomes by education level\u2014job losses are thus far more concentrated among workers without college degrees .\nOf the 13 million young adults in low-wage jobs , 7.1 million do not have a college degree ( associate or bachelor \u2019 s ) and are not making any progress toward one as they work . In our pre-pandemic analysis , we referred to this group as \u201c Cluster 1 , \u201d and will refer to them as such throughout the remainder of this brief .\nThe 7.1 million young adults in Cluster 1 are employed most commonly in occupations such as retail sales , cooks , or servers . The majority are male ( 57 % ) and it is a racially diverse group : 51 % are white , 27 % are Latino or Hispanic , 16 % are Black , and 2 % are Asian American . They have median hourly wages of $ 8.55 and median annual earnings of $ 12,700 .\nNearly half ( 47 % ) of all workers in Cluster 1 work full-time year-round , and they report median annual earnings of about $ 21,000\u2014considerably higher than those working fewer hours , but still a low sum to cover living expenses .\nThe majority ( 54 % ) of Cluster 1 report that a high school diploma is their highest level of education , and another third have attended college or training but did not earn a degree . A portion of this \u201c some college \u201d group may have completed a nondegree credential , but the majority likely did not . Without a credential , most are unlikely to see an economic payoff for their time spent in school and are more likely to default on school-related debt than their peers who completed a degree .\nThirty-one percent of workers in Cluster 1 receive safety net assistance ( SSI , public assistance income , SNAP , or Medicaid ) and about half ( 48 % ) live below 200 % of the federal poverty line , a common threshold used to identify the working poor . A little over half ( 54 % ) are still living with a parent , but one in five are the sole wage earner in their family . Only one-third are secondary earners , defined here as living in a family in which at least one member works and earns moderate to high wages .\nNearly half of low-wage young adults without a college degree work in sectors immediately impacted by COVID-19\nA number of industries have rapidly lost jobs due to social distancing measures , travel restrictions , and related government actions in response to COVID-19 . These immediate-risk industries were compiled in previous Brookings analyses and include retail , passenger transportation , arts and entertainment , accommodation , restaurants and bars , and a variety of other personal services . ( Refer to the appendix for a full list of immediate-risk industries . )\nForty-six percent of workers in Cluster 1 are in immediate-risk industries , compared to 23 % of all U.S. workers . Another 20 % of these young workers are in near-term risk industries . Near-term risk industries\u2014including construction , some manufacturing , and real estate\u2014are less immediately impacted than retail and restaurants , but have started to see layoffs in recent weeks .\nTo learn more about the characteristics and risk exposure of Cluster 1 in your metro area , please refer to the data appendix .\nThe next federal relief package should include a massive jobs program\nYoung people typically have unemployment rates much higher than those of prime-age workers . Given that the current unemployment rate is estimated to be at least 20 % , unemployment rates among young people are likely to be staggeringly high . Moreover , at all ages , unemployment is higher among those with lower levels of education\u2014another strike against the young adults in Cluster 1 .\nMassive unemployment requires a proportionate response , and any future COVID-19 relief legislation should include a large-scale , federally funded employment initiative . Given the extent of the job losses and the likelihood of an economic depression , we should aim to employ millions of people , and authorize such a program for at least three years .\nLooking only at less-educated young adults , it \u2019 s likely that more than 3 million are recently out of work . And that is only a fraction of the newly unemployed , based on the record number of unemployment claims\u201430 million\u2014filed in the past six weeks .\nWe don \u2019 t know when the private sector will start hiring again , but in the meantime , tens of millions of people have bills to pay and mouths to feed . They can \u2019 t wait . The CARES Act \u2019 s expansions to unemployment insurance and the $ 1,200 one-time stimulus payment were good initial steps , but they are not enough .\nA federal jobs initiative should encompass various approaches . It should target a wide range of people , including those at the end of the labor market queue : the last-hired/first-fired workers who typically have less experience and lower levels of education . It should also reach those who ordinarily would not have much trouble finding employment , because even the most qualified candidates will not be able to find a job when there is little demand for workers .\nThe jobs initiative should also explicitly target young people , such as those in Cluster 1 , who are often at the back of the line of job candidates . People in their early 20s are at the beginning of their careers , and early unemployment can have lasting negative consequences . Work begets work .\nTo reach young people and provide them with the skills and supports to prepare them for a successful career , we could dramatically expand YouthBuild , service and conservation corps , or AmeriCorps . There are already two active legislative proposals to expand AmeriCorps : the Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act and the UNITE Act of 2020 . ( Support for AmeriCorps , however , does not eliminate the need for other programs targeted at young adults , since it is only one model and not necessarily the best fit for all young people . )\nAge-agnostic approaches could include subsidized employment in direct aid to states ( as was done in 2009 \u2019 s Recovery Act ) or in any future expansions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act , as has been suggested by Heather Boushey and the Heartland Alliance . The programs could place subsidized workers at nonprofits and businesses , as well as directly employ people in the public sector ; for example , in emergency response , public works , and infrastructure jobs .\nA federal initiative could also place workers in jobs that aid the COVID-19 relief effort , such as contact tracing , making and distributing personal protective equipment , organizing food drives , and delivering groceries to those who are home-bound . They could pursue projects that focus on other community needs , such as providing computer equipment and digital skills training to address the digital divide so clearly highlighted in the stay-at-home era . Of course , any of these employment opportunities should be safe , allowing for adequate social distancing as well as any necessary personal protective equipment .\nReaching millions of people over several years will require hundreds of billions of dollars . We must not flinch at the price tag . We should calibrate our response to the scale of the problem , and not use the size of existing employment-related funding streams as the benchmark . Providing a chance at employment and preventing economic disaster for workers is just as important as\u2014and could be a complement to\u2014the relief for businesses in previous legislation . America \u2019 s young workers are a worthy investment , and we would reap the benefits for years to come .", "Series : Desperation Town How Youngstown Gave Itself Away for the Promise of Jobs\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power .

This article was produced in partnership with The Business Journal , based in Youngstown , Ohio , which is a member of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Local Reporting Network .\nThe state of Ohio has put General Motors on notice that it may be forced to repay more than $ 60 million in public subsidies as a result of the automaker closing its massive assembly plant last year in Lordstown .\nThe state \u2019 s collection effort , initially outlined in a letter to GM in March , has not been previously reported , and the automaker itself has not disclosed the potential liability to shareholders in its corporate filings .\nState officials say the Lordstown shuttering , which made national headlines and drew the ire of President Donald Trump , violated the terms of two state economic development agreements that GM signed more than a decade ago , according to documents obtained by The Business Journal and \u2588\u2588\u2588 through public records requests . In return for tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks , the company had pledged to maintain operations at the Lordstown site until at least 2027 .\n\u201c If the state were to claw back $ 60 million , that would be one of the biggest clawback events in U.S. history , \u201d said Greg LeRoy , executive director of Good Jobs First , a national nonprofit that advocates for accountability in economic development . \u201c This is very significant , very interesting that it would come from a Rust Belt state from a very pro-business administration . \u201d\nThe state Development Services Agency , which oversees economic incentive programs , notified GM in March that it would recommend that the state \u2019 s tax authority terminate the company \u2019 s tax agreements and collect a full refund . Spokesman Todd Walker said the authority would consider the matter at an upcoming meeting , though he declined to specify a date . The authority \u2019 s next session is July 27 , according to its website . Provisions in GM \u2019 s tax agreements allow for state regulators to consider market conditions and whether the company continues to maintain \u201c other operations in the state \u201d before issuing a final determination .\nAnd GM is making its case . In a letter in April , the company urged the state to take into account the collapsing market for small cars \u2014 the hallmark of the Lordstown plant \u2014 and the economic downturn precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic . GM reported net income of $ 294 million for the quarter that ended on March 31 , down from $ 2.1 billion during the same period last year , according to filings .\n\u201c Cash preservation is critically important to General Motors to support a vigorous emergence from the economic and global health crisis , \u201d Troy D. Kennedy , the company \u2019 s U.S. property tax manager , wrote to the Ohio Development Services Agency . \u201c We respectfully request your assistance to help us drive towards a full recovery by choosing not to require repayment of all , or a significant portion of , the tax credits . \u201d\nGM also highlighted its six manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout Ohio , as well as a planned joint venture that would manufacture battery cells for electric vehicles near the Lordstown plant . On Monday , spokesman Dan Flores said in a statement , \u201c We are respectfully asking the state to consider our belief that a repayment of the tax credits would be inconsistent with our significant manufacturing presence in Ohio and the Mahoning Valley . \u201d\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nThe fight over GM \u2019 s corporate tax credits has played out quietly over the last few months and underscores the political bind facing leaders in Ohio and elsewhere as they struggle to revive their economies while also balancing their budgets . Last month , Gov . Mike DeWine ordered $ 775 million in budget cuts to plug a yawning hole in this year \u2019 s spending plan , and state officials are already estimating a $ 2.4 billion deficit for the fiscal year that begins July 1 .\nTaking on one of the country \u2019 s largest automakers would represent a shift for a state and region that has relied heavily on economic incentives to attract new employers and to retain its beleaguered manufacturing base . As The Business Journal and \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last month , local governments like Youngstown have offered businesses free land , tax abatements , development grants , low-interest loans and other inducements to spur investment across Ohio \u2019 s Mahoning Valley .\nAn electronics tester works on a Chevrolet Cruze at Jamestown Industries in Youngstown , Ohio , on Nov. 28 , 2018 . Jamestown Industries supplied parts for the Cruze , the key product at the former Lordstown GM plant . ( Tony Dejak/AP Photo )\nIn 2009 , with gas prices soaring , the state offered the company massive tax breaks to help it expand and retool the Lordstown plant to produce a new , fuel-efficient model , the Chevrolet Cruze . Under the terms of the deal , GM got a 75 % reduction in its income taxes over 15 years \u2014 worth $ 14.2 million \u2014 in exchange for agreeing to add 200 jobs and maintain operations at the site until 2039 . A separate agreement awarded the company an additional $ 46.1 million in tax breaks on the condition that it retain 3,700 employees over 15 years and maintain operations at the site until 2027 .\nBut eight years after signing those pacts , the small car market softened , and GM started to slash jobs at the plant . In January 2017 , it eliminated the so-called third shift at Lordstown . A second shift was cut in June 2018 , the same day the automaker announced it would build its new Chevrolet Blazer in Mexico . Together , the reductions resulted in the loss of more than 2,700 jobs , according to an economic impact report by Cleveland State University .\nIn November 2018 , the automaker announced that it would end production of the Lordstown-built Cruze and place the plant on \u201c unallocated \u201d status , meaning a new product had not been selected for the factory . Trump , who had pledged to resuscitate manufacturing in Ohio and across the Rust Belt , lashed out . \u201c The U.S. saved General Motors , and this is the THANKS we get ! We are now looking at cutting all @ GM subsidies , \u201d he wrote on Twitter .\nThe president did not follow up on the threat , and the last vehicle rolled off the assembly line on March 6 , 2019 . The shutdown eliminated the remaining 1,500 jobs , while hundreds of other automotive supplier positions tied to the plant were also lost .\nOfficials were outraged . U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio , said at the time that GM \u2019 s decision was \u201c corporate greed at its worst . \u201d\nCommunity groups held prayer vigils throughout the area in support of attracting a new vehicle , while children whose parents were employed at the plant wrote letters to GM CEO Mary Barra pleading to keep it open . A choir of middle school students even produced a video singing \u201c We Love GM ! \u201d to the tune of \u201c Under the Sea \u201d from Disney \u2019 s animated film \u201c The Little Mermaid . \u201d\nIt came to nothing . In October , after a 40-day strike was settled with the United Auto Workers union , GM announced it would officially close Lordstown and not award a new product to the plant . In a five-page letter to Ohio regulators in April , Kennedy , the GM official , called it an \u201c extremely difficult decision . \u201d\n\u201c It had been our hope to keep operations at Lordstown going , \u201d he wrote , noting that GM had exceeded its job creation and retention targets through 2016 . \u201c However , we have continued to maintain significant operations in Ohio and make important new investments in the Mahoning Valley . \u201d\nRead More Why a Struggling Rust Belt City Pinned Its Revival on a Self-Chilling Beverage Can Welcome to Youngstown , Ohio , home of Chill-Can , the self-chilling beverage container you \u2019 ve probably never heard of .

Not one job has been created yet .\nThe company highlighted its sale of the Lordstown plant to startup automaker Lordstown Motors , which plans to introduce its first electric-powered pickup , the Endurance , next week and begin production in the first quarter of next year . The Business Journal reported in December that GM had provided $ 40 million in financing to the firm so it could purchase the facility and retool the operation .\nGM also underscored its plans to build a $ 2.3 billion electric-vehicle battery plant in Lordstown , next to the shuttered auto facility . The automaker is partnering with Korea-based LG Chem as part of a new joint venture named Ultium . The new battery plant would employ about 1,100 workers earning between $ 10 and $ 17 per hour , lower than those who work in auto assembly .\n\u201c GM \u2019 s plans for the Mahoning Valley position Lordstown as a crucial manufacturing location for the electric vehicle supply chain , \u201d Kennedy said in his letter .\nIn the meantime , Lordstown is coping with the loss of GM as one of its biggest revenue generators . Eager for the new battery plant , its village council approved new tax breaks for the joint venture in February . The project will receive a 75 % abatement on property levies for 15 years .\n\u201c What we had to get done and needed to get done for General Motors , we did , \u201d Mayor Arno Hill said after the vote .", "New York governor Andrew Cuomo is attempting to prop up public-sector unions in anticipation of a Supreme Court ruling that could end coercive payments .\nA group of Illinois government workers are asking the Supreme Court to overturn four decades of precedent that allow agencies to require union dues or fee payments as a condition of employment . The plaintiffs argued in Janus v. American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees that public-sector unions are inherently political and funding them violates an individual 's association and speech rights . Many in labor circles fear the Supreme Court will endorse this view , dealing a severe blow to union coffers if partial fee payers win the right to opt out of union membership entirely . New York Democrats passed a bill to shore up public-sector dues collections , limit employees ' ability to cut off the unions representing their workplaces , and `` deter the federal government 's attempts to dismantle unions . ''\n`` Too often , and at the hands of this federal administration , we are seeing the labor movement going backwards \u2026 our efforts to protect working men and women are moving labor forward , making the workplace fairer and more just than ever before , '' Governor Cuomo said in a statement . `` We will not let this federal administration silence New York 's working class , we will support every voice in every community and in every industry , and we will do everything in our power to protect the right to achieve the American Dream . ''\nThe law would automatically reenroll workers into labor organizations each year and bolster union officials ' ability to approach new hires . New York has the highest union membership rate in the country\u2014one in four workers belong to labor groups , more than double the national rate of 10.7 percent , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The Janus case could deal a heavy blow to New York unions . An analysis from the Empire Center for Public Policy estimated they could lose as much as $ 110 million if workers win the right to withdraw their support .\nBig Labor has been one of Cuomo 's strongest financial supporters . Union organizations have donated about $ 2 million to his campaigns , according Project Vote Smart . The Cuomo administration did not return requests for comment about the legislation .\nCuomo said the Janus case is designed to hurt workers ' collective bargaining rights . He praised public-sector unions as an `` equalizer '' in a speech to labor leaders as he signed the bill into law .\n`` You are the equalizer at the bargaining table during collective bargaining and they do n't want that , '' he said . Republicans `` want more power in the hands of management so they can exploit the worker . ''\nLabor watchdogs criticized Cuomo for using the legislation to prop up his political allies . Vinnie Vernuccio , a labor policy expert at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy , said it would `` trap '' government workers .\n`` Gov . Cuomo is trying to circumvent a Supreme Court case before it 's even decided to trap public employees into paying union dues , '' he said . `` Gov . Cuomo in New York and other states are looking to do anything they can for unions to keep collecting forced dues including making arbitrary windows in which workers can exercise their rights . ''\nPeter List , a former union organizer who now works as a labor consultant , said Cuomo 's bill should be seen in light of his tough primary fight with Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon .\n`` Cuomo 's action is nothing more than a not-so-hidden attempt to curry favor with his union backers . He needs the union bosses in his back pocket as he tries to fend off Cynthia Nixon . This action does that , '' List said in an email . `` Meanwhile , it puts New York State 's public-sector employers into the position of being likely accomplices in potentially circumventing whatever the Supreme Court rules in the Janus decision . ''\nGreg Mourad , vice president of the National Right to Work Committee , called the bill `` shameful . ''\n`` This is a shameful handout to the union bosses that fund the campaigns of Governor Cuomo and his allies , all at the expense of taxpayers and independent workers who would never join or financially support a union if it were actually voluntary . ''\nCuomo said he hopes the legislation inspires other states to take measures to safeguard union privileges\u2014similar legislation has passed in New Jersey as well .\n`` We 're going to be the state that shows how to mobilize and how to win , '' he said .", "Like more than half of Americans , I live in the suburbs . Luckily , I don \u2019 t have to commute to the city every day\u2014or even wear pants\u2014because I \u2019 m a writer . But if I had a real job , it would take me well over an hour to get from my door to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s offices . As it is , going into New York City for a meeting starts with a 12-minute walk from my house to the commuter rail . That train takes 38 minutes to get to Grand Central station . I then spend about six minutes walking up and down various ramps to get to a subway . The subway takes about eight minutes to get to Port Authority . From there it \u2019 s a 10-minute walk to the office . And that \u2019 s when everything is running on time . Everything takes longer if it \u2019 s raining or snowing or if I \u2019 m hungover . The whole process has to be reverse engineered to get home . Ad Policy\nThat was before the coronavirus . Now commuting to a meeting takes one minute from my bedroom door to my desk chair . Sometimes I take the scenic route and chat with my wife on my way to work . I \u2019 ve gone two months without being within coughing distance of any office . Why would I ever go back ? Why would anybody ? Office workers have known forever that spending hours per day commuting is nonessential and a gigantic waste of time .\nSuburban living isn \u2019 t a phase . It \u2019 s not new . Americans have been moving to the suburbs for nearly a century . That trend has had all sorts of deleterious social and political ramifications . Urban decay , white flight , housing market bubbles , and massively unequal school resources are just a few of the ills caused by suburbanization . And don \u2019 t even get me started on the anodyne , sterile , normative consumerist \u201c culture \u201d championed by the suburban ideal .\nIt would be good for the country if the suburbs were razed to the studs and the land returned to nature . But since that \u2019 s not going to happen , the pandemic is a great opportunity to finally bring our work expectations in line with how and where people actually live .\nDespite technological advances that would look like magic to Alexander Graham Bell , we \u2019 ve remained tied to an Industrial Revolution idea of workers showing up to the giant widget place so an overseer can motivate them to produce profits . Many nonservice industries have had the technology to exist without a centralized office for 30 years , and over the past 20 , the Internet could have made a central office nearly obsolete . But until 10 weeks ago , most people were trudging in to work every day . Current Issue View our current issue\nThat \u2019 s maddening because , while the technology is there to allow many people to work from home , the infrastructure is not there to support the overwhelming and ever-increasing number of commuters . Our infrastructure hasn \u2019 t kept up with our suburban expansion ( or any expansion , really ) . Our bridges and tunnels are crumbling . Our trains and buses are so inefficient that Europeans wonder why we don \u2019 t set them aflame in riots . Our roads and highways are poisonous parking lots warming the planet one traffic jam at a time .\nThe negative environmental impact of commuting is undeniable . Studies show that the average drive to work adds 4.3 metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere a year\u2014per car . If everyone in the US drove just 10 percent less , it would have the equivalent environmental effect of taking 28 coal-fueled power plants off-line for a year . And let \u2019 s not forget : Commuting is unhealthy . People with longer commutes tend to be less physically active and have higher rates of obesity and high blood pressure . Every commuter has been told to take the stairs as a way to build in some daily exercise , but \u201c don \u2019 t spend three hours a day sitting on a train \u201d is also solid physical fitness advice .\nAnd that \u2019 s where we were before Covid-19 made us more aware that our public transportation systems are petri dishes for communicable diseases . One of the most mind-blowing moments in the whole pandemic was when New York City announced , triumphantly , that it would start bleaching its subway cars every night . I did not know until that moment that I had spent most of my life riding around in yesterday \u2019 s filth , not just today \u2019 s . I \u2019 m going to need a hazmat suit before I get on the subway again .\nI simply can not fathom a world in which the pandemic is declared over and everybody starts commuting to work again . I do not think that we can go back to expecting people to fork over hours and hours a day sitting in traffic or trapped on a disease tube simply because they have a meeting . Zoom or Skype or Google Hangouts might not be the ideal way to conduct face-to-face business , but the lockdown has shown that any number of daily , mind-numbing check-in meetings can be handled remotely . More from Mystal Bill de Blasio Has Failed the Test of This Moment Elie Mystal\nThere will be resistance to allowing people to work from home after the pandemic has passed . What \u2019 s the point of having a sweet corner office if nobody \u2019 s there to cower outside it ? Working from home robs many bosses and brownnosers of some of their favorite methods for doling out favors and establishing loyalty . When everybody is working remotely , the work kind of has to stand for itself . But that \u2019 s a bad paradigm if you \u2019 re a talentless man who has your job only because your dad and the boss are golfing buddies . There are a lot of people whose only professional skill is laughing at their boss \u2019 s jokes at happy hour , and those people can \u2019 t wait to get back to the office .\nBut the raw efficiency of working from home will , with any luck , cause most offices to embrace working remotely . Now that people have had this taste of managing their own time like the adults they \u2019 ve always been , dragging them back into a daily routine of inefficiency and health risks will be hard . Telecommuting was one of the big ideas to emerge in the late 20th century . In the post-pandemic 21st century , it might finally become a reality .", "John O. Brennan , President Obama \u2019 s pick to lead the CIA , defended the administration \u2019 s drone execution program before Congress on Thursday , saying that in war the commander in chief has the right to order a targeted killing \u2014 but agreeing that Congress should be more involved in knowing what is happening .\nMr. Brennan , who is Mr. Obama \u2019 s homeland security adviser and is considered one of the key architects of the war on terrorism in recent years , also said he is not sure whether interrogation techniques such as waterboarding produced any valuable information from suspected terrorist detainees .\nIn a hearing interrupted repeatedly by anti-war protesters , Mr. Brennan denied he had leaked classified information to reporters and told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he will try to work with Capitol Hill so that lawmakers are aware of the administration \u2019 s operations in the war on terrorism .\nSenators homed in on targeted killings by armed unmanned aerial vehicles , begun under President George W. Bush and dramatically expanded by Mr. Obama . The drone program has come under scrutiny after the Obama administration used it to kill an American citizen living in Yemen .\n\u201c I understand you can \u2019 t have co-commanders in chief , but having the executive being the prosecutor , the judge , the jury and the executioner all in one is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country , \u201d said Sen. Angus S. King Jr. , Maine independent .\nMr. Brennan replied that this was not a judicial proceeding .\n\u201c The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front , again , are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious , as well as imminent , that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike , \u201d he said .\nWith some senators threatening to delay Mr. Brennan \u2019 s nomination to be CIA director until more information is disclosed , the White House late Wednesday said it would provide to the committee legal memos detailing advice about the drone program .\nNBC News this week obtained and released a 16-page Justice Department memo laying out the legal justification for the program .\nThree Americans are known to have been killed by the program \u2014 all of them in Yemen and all by missile strikes from drones .\nThe three are radical Islamic preacher Anwar al-Awlaki , a senior leader in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) ; his 16-year-old son , Abdulrahman al-Awlaki ; and AQAP propagandist Samir Khan .\nU.S. officials have said that al-Awlaki was targeted directly only because he had an \u201c operational role \u201d in recruiting and training suicide terrorists including the Nigerian would-be \u201c underwear bomber \u201d Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab . The other two were killed in strikes targeting other AQAP leaders .\nSeveral Republicans closely questioned Mr. Brennan about leaks to the news media regarding Obama administration national security successes . Mr. Brennan denied that he was the source of any of them .\n\u201c I never provided classified information to reporters , \u201d Mr. Brennan said . He added that his contacts with the news media were arranged by the White House press office and aimed at explaining administration policy .\nSen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat , told the hearing that Congress , and eventually the American public , needed to see the documents outlining the legal basis for the targeted-killing program .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to see any and all opinions before the vote \u201d on the nomination , Mr. Wyden said .\nHe also called for the legal opinions to be made public so that Americans could judge for themselves the exact extent of the authority President Obama asserts to kill U.S. citizens without charge or trial if they are senior al Qaeda leaders who can not be captured .\n\u201c What it really goes to is the issue of checks and balances , \u201d he said .\nMr. King asked Mr. Brennan to allow the judicial branch to oversee targeted killings of U.S. citizens , as it authorized intelligence surveillance against Americans , through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court \u2014 a secret tribunal that grants warrants for the electronic and physical surveillance of Americans suspected of espionage or terrorism .\n\u201c I would like to suggest to you that you consider a FISA court-type process , where an American citizen is going to be targeted for a lethal strike , \u201d Mr. King told Mr. Brennan .\n\u201c At least that would be some check , \u201d Mr. King said . \u201c I have great confidence in you . I have great confidence in President Obama . But all the lessons of history are , it shouldn \u2019 t matter who \u2019 s in charge , because we should have procedures and processes in place that will protect us . \u201d\nSome Republicans asked Mr. Brennan whether the administration \u2019 s expanded use of the lethal strikes by remotely piloted drone aircraft grew from its decision to abjure the capture , detention and harsh interrogation techniques employed by the Bush administration .\n\u201c Is your testimony today that the huge increase in the number of lethal strikes has no connection to the change in the Obama administration \u2019 s detention policy ? \u201d said Sen. Susan M. Collins , Maine Republican . \u201c Because obviously , if we \u2019 re capturing a terrorist , we have the opportunity to interrogate that individual and perhaps learn of ongoing plots . But if the strike is done , that opportunity is lost . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s never been occasion that I \u2019 m aware of where we had the opportunity to capture a terrorist and we didn \u2019 t and we decided to take a lethal strike , \u201d replied Mr. Brennan . \u201c So certainly there is no correlation there . \u201d\nHe added that the expanding use of drones was in part a result of \u201c the maturation of capabilities and insights into [ al Qaeda ] plots as a result of the investment that was made in the previous administration . \u201d\nOther Republicans focused on questioning Mr. Brennan about administration leaks to the media .\n\u201c I engaged in discussions with reporters about classified issues that they might have had access to because of unfortunate leaks of classified information , and I frequently work with reporters , if not editors of newspapers , to keep out of the public domain some of this country \u2019 s most important secrets , \u201d Mr. Brennan said .\n\u201c Whenever I deal with reporters , I do so at the request of the White House press office and they set the ground rules , \u201d he said .\nHe said that he voluntary cooperated with the Department of Justice investigation into the leak of information about a double agent inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) who helped U.S. and allied agencies foil an underwear bomb plot .\nMr. Brennan said he had \u201c been interviewed on it \u201d and his office turned over \u201c all relevant materials , \u201d including any notes of the conference call .\nHe denied that a statement he made in a conference call with former officials last year about the plot had compromised intelligence sources and methods .\nThe call had been arranged because the former officials were all going on news programs to discuss the foiling of the plot , which targeted U.S. aviation .\nMr. Brennan said , in a statement later repeated publicly by several of the former officials , that the United States had \u201c inside control \u201d of the plot and that the underwear bomb was never a threat to American aviation .\nLater that day , news agencies broke the story that an a U.S. allied agency had an agent inside the AQAP cell planning the bombing .\nMr. Brennan said he needed to explain that the U.S. had \u201c inside control , \u201d because during the time of the plot \u2014 around the first anniversary of the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden \u2019 s compound in Pakistan \u2014 he and other officials had reassured that there was no specific actionable intelligence about threats or plots .\n\u201c We had said publicly that there was no active plot at the time of the bin Laden anniversary , \u201d he said .\nMr. Brennan is a 25-year career intelligence officer who served in the Bush administration as the first head of the National Counterterrorism Center . In 2008 , he was a close adviser to Mr. Obama in the Senate .", "In his first major policy speech Wednesday , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel signaled he will be taking a hard look at the way the Pentagon spends its money and at whether the US military needs quite so many officers .\nHe also said that while the US military \u201c remains an essential tool of American power , \u201d it is also \u201c one that must be used judiciously , with a keen appreciation of its limits . \u201d\nSpeaking at the National Defense University in Washington , Secretary Hagel invoked the memory of President Dwight Eisenhower , who came up as a young officer in the wake of the Great Depression . He noted that the World War II general spoke at the same university 50 years ago .\n\u201c The wise and prudent administration of the vast resources required by defense calls for extraordinary skill in meshing the military , political , economic , and social machinery of our modern life , \u201d Hagel said , quoting Eisenhower . \u201c So the greatest effective use is made of resources with a minimum of waste and misapplication . \u201d\nNow that the \u201c gusher \u201d of war-time military spending is turned off , Hagel said , top Pentagon officials will be taking a hard look at some key spending areas .\nThis speech signaled precisely what those areas will be : acquisitions , personnel costs , and overhead .\n\u201c Left unchecked , spiraling costs to sustain existing structures and institutions , provide benefits to personnel , and develop replacements for aging weapons platforms will eventually crowd out spending on procurement , operations , and readiness \u00ad\u2013 the budget categories that enable the military to be and stay prepared , \u201d Hagel warned .\nThis will mean taking a hard look at Pentagon employees , including \u201c how many people we have \u2013 military and civilian \u2013 how many we need , what these people do , and how we compensate them for their work , service , and loyalty with pay , benefits and health care . \u201d\nThis will in turn prompt \u201c tough questions , \u201d Hagel concedes , including `` what is the right mix of civilians and military , and whether the force has the right balance of officers and enlisted . \u201d\nMuch of the DOD \u2019 s organizational chart dates back \u201c to the early days of the Cold War , \u201d Hagel said , noting that the last major defense reorganization was drafted during the height of the Reagan defense buildup .\nWhile the military \u201c is not , and never should be , run like a corporation , \u201d Hagel noted , there is a danger that the DOD could go from \u201c an agency protecting the nation to an agency administering benefit programs , capable of buying only limited quantities of irrelevant and overpriced equipment . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

''", "Obama said he 's not like Cheney during a closed-door Senate Democratic conference . | AP Photos Obama on drones : I 'm not Cheney\nPresident Barack Obama \u2019 s defense to Democratic senators complaining about how little his administration has told Congress about the legal justifications for his drone policy : Dick Cheney was worse .\nThat \u2019 s part of what two senators in the room recounted of Obama \u2019 s response when , near the outset of his closed-door session with the Senate Democratic conference on Tuesday , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D-W.Va. ) confronted the president over the administration \u2019 s refusal for two years to show congressional intelligence committees Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel memos justifying the use of lethal force against American terror suspects abroad .\nObama recently allowed members of those panels to see the memos , but only after senators in both parties threatened to hold up the confirmation of John Brennan as Central Intelligence Agency director . Brennan was confirmed last week , but lawmakers not on one of the intelligence panels are still being denied access to the memos and several are steamed over being frozen out .\nIn response to Rockefeller \u2019 s critique , Obama said he \u2019 s not involved in drafting such memos , the senators told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . He also tried to assure his former colleagues that his administration is more open to oversight than that of President George W. Bush , whom many Democratic senators attacked for secrecy and for expanding executive power in the national security realm .\n\u201c This is not Dick Cheney we \u2019 re talking about here , \u201d he said , according to Democratic senators who asked not to be named discussing the private meeting .\nTwo Obama administration officials , who asked not to be named , confirmed Rockefeller raised the drone oversight issue with the president at the session . The White House had no comment on Obama \u2019 s alleged reference to the former vice president .\nWhile Obama defended his handling of the issue , he told his former Senate colleagues he understood their concerns about being left out of the loop on such sensitive decisions , senators said . The president noted that he would have \u201c probably objected \u201d over the White House \u2019 s handling of this issue if he were still a senator , they said . But , according to the sources , he noted his viewpoint changed now that he occupies the Oval Office \u2014 not a room in a Senate office building .", "In the end , President Obama was forced to listen to his generals \u2014 not his political instincts \u2014 on Afghanistan troop levels , and he decided to split the difference .\nMr. Obama is keeping 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond his presidency , about half the strength recommended by his top general in-country . It marks the sixth time he has rejected the advice of a ground commander on the force size in the long Iraq and Afghanistan wars . Military experts call that streak unprecedented for a commander in chief .\nLike the current 9,800 U.S. troops there , the drawdown force of 5,500 will maintain a noncombat stance in training Afghan forces and hunting al Qaeda terrorists , Mr. Obama said Thursday . Administration officials said the U.S. will spend about $ 14.6 billion a year to house the troops at a total of four bases in Kabul , Kandahar , Jalalabad and Bagram \u2014 an increase over the estimated $ 10 billion annual cost of keeping a force at the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital .\nThe president had wanted to deliver a speech saying that all American troops were out of Afghanistan at the end of next year , as he did in 2011 for the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq . But he was swayed by the dark picture of the Afghan conflict that the top brass has been drawing for him , and now Mr. Obama will pass the war onto the next president in 2017 .\nThe battlefield facts delivered to the White House by Army Gen. John Campbell , the top NATO commander in Afghanistan , and other generals :\n\u2022 The Taliban mounted a ferocious offensive in the 2015 \u201c fighting season \u201d that took a heavy casualty toll on the shaky Afghan National Security Forces .\n\u2022 Those forces still lack competent leaders to win decisive battles without American troops to guide them .\n\u2022 A new enemy has emerged , the ultraviolent Islamic State ( also known as ISIL or ISIS ) in a province next door to Kabul , the Afghan capital . This confronted the elected government with new security threats , especially the terrorist army \u2019 s trademark vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices .\n\u201c The security situation in Afghanistan is so far from stable that to pull out all the troops , even for this president , doesn \u2019 t make any sense , \u201d said retired Army Gen. John Keane , who devised the 2007 Iraq troop surge and has advised Afghan commanders in the past .\nMr. Keane , whose guidance is sought by Congress , said Gen. Campbell wanted to retain the current force of 9,800 , but Mr. Obama \u201c cut that in half . \u201d\n\u201c He still does not listen to his combat field general , who wanted the current force to remain as is , \u201d Mr. Keane said . \u201c Quite unprecedented , this is the sixth time President Obama has not listened to a field commander recommendation on force levels for troops in combat . \u201d\nThe six times : Mr. Obama rejected a recommendation from Army Gen. Lloyd Austin , chief of U.S. Central Command , to keep about 20,000 troops in Iraq ; at five transition points in Afghanistan , he approved troop numbers below those urged by commanders .\nStill , Mr. Obama did compromise on troops and infrastructure instead of ordering the complete withdrawal he had wanted .\n\u201c The goodness in this decision are the four bases , \u201d Mr. Keane said . \u201c If he had reduced it to one base , which they were thinking of doing , that would be a disaster .\n\u201c The four bases permits the military to conduct counterterrorism operations in the east , south and in vicinity of the capital , which is absolutely critical , one of the crucial capabilities we lost when we pulled all troops out of Iraq , \u201d he said . \u201c Also , the four bases permits the next president to expand the troop presence rapidly based on the security situation 15 months from now .\n\u201c What suffers as a result of this decision is the train-and-assist mission , because we won \u2019 t have sufficient troops to do it properly , \u201d the retired general said .\nTrain-and-assist is one of three major missions now carried out by American forces . The other two : advise and accompany Afghan forces on counterterrorism operations and provide force protection .\nOn Thursday , the administration defended the president against criticism that he ignored the advice of his top military advisers , with White House press secretary Josh Earnest saying that Mr. Obama \u2019 s decision is \u201c consistent with \u201d Gen. Campbell \u2019 s recommendation .\nIt is likely that Gen. Campbell \u2019 s communications with the White House in recent months mirrored the somber report he delivered Oct. 6 to the Senate Armed Services Committee .\nThere he spoke of a \u201c struggling \u201d Afghan force that faced its longest fighting season as the Taliban began early \u2014 in February . In the east , the Islamic State \u201c further complicated the theater landscape and potentially expanded the conflict , \u201d Gen. Campbell said .\nAll the while , he said , the Afghans lacked the robust U.S. air power they had come to rely on to arrive on the scene in minutes and deliver precision fire . Such air support \u201c is no longer the norm but the exception , \u201d he said .\nThe commander \u2019 s report card on the Afghan force : \u201c They must improve their intelligence fusion , command and control utilization of their forces . They don \u2019 t possess the necessary combat power and numbers to protect every part of the country . This makes it very difficult for the Afghan security forces to counter the Taliban \u2019 s ability to temporarily seize an objective and then blend back into the population . \u201d\nMarine Corps General Joseph Dunford , the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is now Mr. Obama \u2019 s chief military adviser .\nDuring his July confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Gen. Dunford all but broke with the president \u2019 s then-desire to pull all troops out by the end of 2016 . One could extrapolate from his answers to questions from committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , that he would attempt to talk the president out of that plan .\n\u201c Is this a wise decision on your part to have a calendar-based withdrawal of American troops rather than a condition-based withdrawal given your background and experience there ? \u201d Mr. McCain asked Gen. Dunford , a former Afghan NATO commander .\n\u201c I \u2019 m aware of the consequences of our mission and importance of our mission in Afghanistan , \u201d the general answered . \u201c I can assure you , if I \u2019 m confirmed , I \u2019 ll provide advice to the president that will allow us to meet our desired end state . And I think that that will be based on the conditions on the ground , as you \u2019 ve articulated . \u201d\nMr. McCain said Thursday \u201c it makes no military sense to withdraw U.S. forces \u201d below the current 9,800 .\n\u201c Once again , President Obama is putting our mission in Afghanistan , as well as our men and women serving there , at greater risk , and he is doing so for the sake of a troop reduction that has no political benefit but could have significant military implications , \u201d he said .", "Iran , Israel , Defense Cuts To Be Key Topics At Hagel Hearing\nWhat 's shaping up to be one of the more contentious nomination hearings for one of President Obama 's cabinet choices is set to open at 9:30 a.m . ET when members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services get their chance to publicly grill former Sen. Chuck Hagel , R-Neb. , who has been tapped for the post of defense secretary .\nAs Ari Shapiro reported on Morning Edition , Obama 's choices of Hagel , Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass. , for secretary of state , and counterterrorism adviser John Brennan for CIA director , `` represent a shift in the way the U.S. wages war . It 's a shift from big to small , from the Pentagon to the CIA . ''\nBut today 's Hagel hearing , as Defense News writes , is expected to be dominated by the issues of Israel , Iran and looming defense budget cuts and sharp questions about the nominees views :\n`` Since Hagel 's name was floated for the post in early December , Hagel has been sharply criticized by his former fellow-GOP senators and pro-Israel groups for his past comments on the U.S.-Israel alliance , whether the Pentagon budget can and should be trimmed , how to confront Iran over its nuclear arms program , gay rights and the proper size of the U.S. nuclear arms fleet . Expect questions on all those topics . ''\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times , Hagel `` will stress at his confirmation hearing Thursday that he opposes letting Iran acquire nuclear weapons and will focus on developing military options to set back Tehran 's program , according to a U.S. official familiar with his planned testimony . ''\nThe conventional wisdom in Washington seems to be that after some initial doubts , it 's now likely Hagel will be confirmed . The Washington Post 's The Fix blog this morning suggests there are `` 5 senators to watch '' during the hearing : Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas ; Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand , D-N.Y. ; Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. ; Sen. Jim Inhofe , R-Okla. ; and Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz .\nWe 'll monitor the hearing and post highlights later .

Supporters cited Hagel \u2019 s experience as an enlisted soldier in Vietnam and his service in the Senate and elsewhere as reasons he should succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while opponents stuck with their criticisms about Hagel \u2019 s past positions on Iran , Israel and the defense budget .\nA few Republicans kept up their bid to stop Hagel \u2019 s nomination from moving ahead , arguing he has kept some information from the committee , but Democrats insisted that he has satisfied its disclosure requirements and accused Republicans of tarring Hagel unfairly .\nSen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) said Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) had `` gone over the line '' and `` basically ... impugned the patriotism of the nominee \u201d by pointing out that the Iranian Foreign Ministry had praised Hagel .\nThe top Republican on the committee , Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , shot back later in defense of Cruz , `` You do n't get any cozier than that . ''\nFormer ranking member Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) interjected soon thereafter with a message for his colleagues : `` Sen. Hagel is an honorable man who has served his country , and no one on this committee at any time should impugn his character , '' McCain said .\nBut for most of the meeting , senators referred to Hagel \u2019 s late January confirmation hearing . McCain slammed Hagel \u2019 s performance as \u201c the worst I have seen of any nomination for office \u201d and said it was \u201c disturbing \u201d that Hagel would not directly respond to his question about whether the Iraq surge was a success . Democrats said the criticism of Hagel \u2019 s day in the spotlight was unfair , and they defended his description of a policy of \u201c containment \u201d for a nuclear Iran \u2014 which the White House does not support \u2013 as a simple slip of the tongue .\nApart from the politics involved with Hagel himself , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) had warned senators that rejecting him would endanger the Pentagon at a time it could ill afford another complication .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s a risk here , it is that the defeat of this nomination would leave the Department of Defense leaderless at a time when we face immense budgetary challenges and our military is engaged in combat operations overseas , '' Levin said .\nWhile he acknowledged that many senators oppose President Barack Obama 's foreign policy , `` our vote on Sen. Hagel 's nomination will not change those policies . ''\nThe meeting ultimately proved civil compared with what might have been \u2014 Republican aides had suggested earlier that some GOP senators were considering walking out to protest what they called Hagel \u2019 s insufficient financial disclosures . Inhofe and Cruz later ruled that out .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think anything is gained by theatrics , \u201d Cruz told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nJust the same , Republicans continued to try to put on the brakes . Louisiana Sen. David Vitter quarreled with Levin over what Vitter said was an incomplete disclosure from Hagel of past speeches , and Cruz renewed the GOP line of questioning about whether Hagel had taken payments from \u201c foreign sources . \u201d\nHagel \u2019 s nomination now proceeds to the Senate floor , where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) has said he hopes the chamber could vote on it Wednesday or Thursday .\nSome Republicans said they might continue to oppose Hagel before the full Senate , but Reid responded with a single word on Tuesday when asked whether he \u2019 d honor an attempt at a hold : \u201c No . \u201d\nWith 55 Democrats controlling the Senate and two Republicans \u2014 Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi \u2014 already publicly supporting Hagel , only three more Republicans would need to support him for confirmation under a request from Republicans for a 60-vote threshold .\nInhofe said Monday night that he would not use his privilege to delay Hagel \u2019 s confirmation into the weekend or early next week , so long as Democrats produced 60 votes upfront to support Hagel .\nThis article first appeared on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Pro at 5:05 p.m. on February 12 , 2013 .", "A federal appeals court Thursday ruled in favor of faith-based nonprofits who fought Obamacare \u2019 s birth control rules , dealing an elusive victory to religious employers who now have a stronger hand in urging the Supreme Court to shield them from the administration \u2019 s \u201c contraception mandate . \u201d\nIn a pair of opinions , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit sided with religious universities and ministries that object to insuring contraceptives they equate with abortion and feel that opt-out routes provided by the Department of Health and Human Services keep them complicit in sin .\nThe rulings upheld a lower court \u2019 s finding and marked a significant break from other circuit rulings that said HHS \u2019 s efforts to accommodate the groups were sufficient .\nUnder HHS rules , religious employers who object to covering birth control must notify an insurer , plan administrator or the government in writing so that a third party can manage and pay for the coverage .\n\u201c If one equates the self-certification process with , say , that of obtaining a parade permit , then indeed the burden might well be considered light . But if one sincerely believes that completing [ the opt-out form ] or HHS Notice will result in conscience-violating consequences , what some might consider an otherwise neutral act is a burden too heavy to bear , \u201d wrote Judge Roger L. Wollman , an appointee of President Ronald Reagan , joined by judges William D. Benton and Steven M. Colloton , both appointees of President George W. Bush .\nThe contraception mandate is an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved drugs and services as part of their health plans or else pay hefty fines . Pitched as a boon for women \u2019 s health , the rules quickly spawned controversy , with dozens of religious nonprofits and devout business owners filing suit .\nMany Catholic employers object to all forms of contraception , while evangelical groups and others say they \u2019 re only opposed to morning-after pills they equate with abortion .\nFamily owned for-profits were victorious before the Supreme Court last year , forcing HHS to draft an accommodation for them . The same rules that HHS drafted for religious nonprofits now apply to the closely held companies , although they must meet certain standards .\nPlaintiffs on the nonprofit side are not satisfied though . They want the same blanket exemption from the mandate that houses of worship enjoy .\nSeveral faith-based nonprofits have asked the justices to take up their case in the coming term .\nWith a circuit split in hand , they \u2019 ve got a much better shot at grabbing the court \u2019 s attention .\n\u201c The government keeps telling the Supreme Court \u2018 Move along , nothing important here \u2019 in hopes that the court will ignore this crucial issue . But with today \u2019 s decisions , the court will have great reason to decide this issue in the next term , \u201d said Lori Windham , senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty .\nThe Eighth Circuit cited the justices \u2019 holding in the for-profit case , known as \u201c Hobby Lobby , \u201d that enforcing the mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2014 a bipartisan 1993 law that says the government had to have a compelling interest in carrying out a law that substantially burdens a person \u2019 s religious beliefs , and must do so in the least restrictive way possible .\nUnlike other circuits , Thursday \u2019 s panel said the HHS accommodation presented a substantial burden on faith-based nonprofits .\nCiting the 2014 decision , the panel said \u201c it is not our role to second-guess [ the plaintiffs \u2019 ] honest assessment of a \u2018 difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy , namely , the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another . \u2019 \u201d\nBrigitte Amiri , a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union \u2019 s Reproductive Freedom Project , said she disagreed with the decision but acknowledged that it increases the likelihood that the justices will take up one of the faith group \u2019 s cases .\n\u201c Although we all have the right to our religious beliefs , those beliefs can not be used to harm or discriminate against others , \u201d she said . \u201c Today \u2019 s decision is also an outlier \u2014 all of the other seven courts of appeals to consider the issue have found that the accommodation available for nonprofit organizations does not substantially burden the employers \u2019 religious beliefs . \u201d\nThursday \u2019 s ruling addressed lawsuits from Dordt College in Iowa , Heartland Christian College in Missouri and CNS International Ministries , Inc. ( CNS ) , a Missouri nonprofit that helps people with substance abuse and behavioral problems .\nThe groups said intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) and emergency contraceptives covered by the mandate are the same as \u201c abortion on demand . \u201d", "Despite barely beating a midnight deadline , hundreds of jeering protesters helped stop Texas lawmakers from passing one of the toughest abortion measures in the country .\nAs the protesters raised the noise to deafening levels in the Texas Senate chamber late Tuesday , Republicans scrambled to gather their colleagues at the podium for a stroke-of-midnight vote .\n`` Get them out ! '' Sen. Donna Campbell shouted to a security guard , pointing to the thundering crowd in the gallery overhead that had already been screaming for more than 10 minutes .\n`` Time is running out , '' Campbell pleaded . `` I want them out of here ! ''\nIt did n't work . The noise never stopped and despite barely beating the midnight end-of-session deadline with a vote to pass the bill , Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst said the chaos in the chamber prevented him from formally signing it before the deadline passed , effectively killing it .\nDewhurst denounced the protesters as an `` unruly mob . '' Democrats who urged them on called the outburst democracy in action .\nIn either point of view , a raucous crowd of chanting , singing , shouting demonstrators effectively took over the Texas Capitol and blocked a bill that abortion rights groups warned would close most abortion clinics in the state .\n`` They were asking for their voices to be heard , '' said Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth , who spent nearly 11 hours trying to filibuster the bill before the outburst . `` The results speak for themselves . ''\nInitially , Republicans insisted the vote started before the midnight deadline and passed the bill that Democrats spent the day trying to kill . But after official computer records and printouts of the voting record showed the vote took place Wednesday , and then were changed to read Tuesday , senators retreated into a private meeting to reach a conclusion .\nAt 3 a.m. , Dewhurst emerged from the meeting still insisting the 19-10 vote was in time , but said , `` with all the ruckus and noise going on , I could n't sign the bill '' and declared it dead .\nHe denounced the more than 400 protesters who staged what they called `` a people 's filibuster '' from 11:45 p.m. to well past midnight . He denied mishandling the debate .\n`` I did n't lose control ( of the chamber ) . We had an unruly mob , '' Dewhurst said . He even hinted that Gov . Rick Perry may immediately call another 30-day special session , adding : `` It 's over . It 's been fun . But see you soon . ''\nMany of the protesters had flocked to the normally quiet Capitol to support Davis , who gained national attention and a mention from President Barack Obama 's campaign Twitter account . Her Twitter following went from 1,200 in the morning to more than 20,000 by Tuesday night .\n`` My back hurts . I do n't have a lot of words left , '' Davis said when it was over and she was showered with cheers by activists who stayed at the Capitol to see her . `` It shows the determination and spirit of Texas women . ''\nDavis ' mission was cut short . Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst halted the filibuster after determining Davis had strayed off the topic when she talked about a sonogram bill passed in 2011 and how the new abortion restrictions only compounded the anti-abortion laws in Texas . Democrats immediately appealed the decision and set off a heated debate over rules . At one point , Austin Democratic Sen. Kirk Watson appeared to be positioning himself to launch a new filibuster on Dewhurst 's decision .\nBut Davis ' effort ultimately helped Democrats earn a rare victory in a Legislature dominated by Republicans for more than a decade .\n`` It 's a bad bill , '' said Sen. Watson , leader of the Senate Democrats .\nThe bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics that perform the procedure to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers . Also , doctors would be required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles \u2014 a tall order in rural communities .\nIf signed into law , the measures would have closed almost every abortion clinic in Texas , a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people . A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passed . The law 's provision that abortions be performed at surgical centers means only five of Texas ' 42 abortion clinics are currently designated to remain in operation .\nRepublicans and anti-abortion groups insisted their goal was to improve women 's health care , but also acknowledged wanting clinics to close .\n`` If this passes , abortion would be virtually banned in the state of Texas , and many women could be forced to resort to dangerous and unsafe measures , '' said Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and daughter of the late former Texas governor Ann Richards .\nThe showdown came after Davis had slogged her way through about 11 hours of speaking while Senate Republicans \u2014 and several House members \u2014 watched and listened for any slipup that would allow them to end the filibuster and call a vote .\nDemocrats chose Davis , of Fort Worth , to lead the effort because of her background ; she had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School .\nRules stipulated she remain standing , not lean on her desk or take any breaks \u2014 even for meals or to use the bathroom . But she also was required to stay on topic , and Republicans pointed out a mistake and later protested again when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace .\nLawmakers can vote to end a filibuster after three sustained points of order . As tension mounted over Davis ' speech and the dwindling clock , Campbell , a first-term lawmaker from New Braunfels , made the call on the third violation , sparking nearly two hours of debate on how to handle it .\nAfter much back and forth and senators shouting over each other , the Republican majority forced a vote to end the filibuster minutes before midnight , sparking the raucous response from protesters .\nSenate security and several Department of Public Safety state troopers tried to quiet the crowd but were simply outnumbered and had no hope of stopping the outburst .\nSen. Dan Patrick , R-Houston , blamed the confusion surrounding the final vote on the demonstrators and Democratic senators who urged them on .\n`` Had that not happened , everyone would have known , '' what was happening , Patrick said .\nStanding next to him was Sen.

What other conclusion can one reach when 44 out of 47 Senate Democrats blocked the Senate from voting on a bill requiring that any baby who survives an abortion \u2014 in other words , a baby who was born \u2014 must be brought to a hospital for care and treated with \u201c the same degree of professional skill , care , and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age . \u201d\nWhoever intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive described under subsection ( a ) , shall be punished\u2026 for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being .\nGood grief , who could object to that ? At least six want-to-be presidents \u2014 Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders , Kirsten Gillibrand , Amy Klobuchar , Cory Booker , and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 did . That \u2019 s stunning .\nWe have been here before . During the height of the eugenics movement in the 1920s and 30s , activists sought to \u201c improve \u201d the human herd by preventing the so-called \u201c unfit \u201d from being born \u2014 generally through involuntary sterilization of those considered eugenically incorrect . Appallingly , some 60,000 people were involuntarily sterilized under color of law in the United States during the first half of the 20th century .\nSome famous advocates wanted to go even further , advocating the killing of babies who did not pass eugenics muster . For example , in his splendid history of the eugenics movement , War Against the Weak , Edwin Black reports that birth control advocate and social Darwinist Margaret Sanger , proudly spouted \u201c the extreme eugenic view that human \u2018 weeds \u2019 should be \u2018 exterminated. \u2019 \u201d Bizarrely , so did Helen Keller \u2014 as if the fact that her disabilities weren \u2019 t congenital would have protected her once the slaughter of the \u201c defectives \u201d began .\nSystematic infanticide was never legalized in the United States . But in Germany , doctors killed tens of thousands of disabled babies between 1939-1945 . It is important to note that Hitler did not force medical personnel to kill disabled babies ( although doctors and midwives were required legally to report their births ) . Rather , doctors who committed infanticide did so willingly , believing that their killing was a \u201c healing treatment \u201d for the child , the family , and the Reich .\nAfter the war , infanticide was scorned universally as evil . But now , that moral consensus has frayed . Indeed , one could say that infanticide is making a comeback .\nOne need only look at the world \u2019 s foremost medical and bioethics journals to see the trendline . Princeton University \u2019 s bioethics professor Peter Singer became famous by claiming that newborn babies are killable because they have not yet developed the cognitive capacities to be considered a \u201c person. \u201d He wrote in Rethinking Life and Death , \u201c Since neither a newborn infant nor a fish is a person the wrongness of killing such beings is not as great as the wrongness of killing a person. \u201d In other words , to Singer , a newborn infant is the moral equivalent of a mackerel .\nIn a 2010 Harvard symposium on abortion and infanticide , Singer tied infanticide to the legality of abortion : \u201c The position that allows abortion also allows infanticide under some circumstances.\u2026 If we accept abortion , we do need to rethink some of those more fundamental attitudes about human life . \u201d\nIn another world and time , Singer \u2019 s advocacy would make him an intellectual outcast . Instead , far from being a fringe character , Singer is invited to present at seminars , symposia , and philosophy association conventions throughout the world . He is often quoted respectfully in the mainstream media , including frequently in New York Times , where he is also a recurring contributor .\nSinger is far from alone . A few years ago , the Journal of Medical Ethics published an advocacy article entitled , \u201c After-Birth Abortion : Why Should the Baby Live ? \u201d Consider the following quotes that the editors of one of the world \u2019 s most prestigious bioethics journals considered worthy of respectful dissemination :\n\u201c The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus , that is , neither can be considered a \u2018 person \u2019 in a morally relevant sense . \u201d\n\u201c In spite of the oxymoron in the expression , we propose to call this practice \u2018 after-birth \u2019 abortion , \u2019 rather than \u2018 infanticide , \u2019 to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus\u2026 rather than that of a child . \u201d\n\u201c We claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all circumstances where abortion would be . \u201d\n\u201c Merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life . \u201d\nThe authors also claim that killing healthy and able-bodied babies should be allowable because , \u201c we also need to consider the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving up her child for adoption. \u201d The mind boggles .\nAlas , infanticide has gone beyond mere advocacy in the modern world . For decades , China turned a blind eye to chronic female infanticide that resulted from its odious \u201c one child policy , \u201d recently abandoned because it led to a catastrophic demographic imbalance between males and females . India has also seen a problem with sex-selection \u201c after-birth abortions . \u201d\nThe Netherlands has embraced wartime Germany \u2019 s scorned policy of allowing babies born with terminal illnesses and serious disabilities to be subjected to homicide by doctors . And , it is done under color of law under a bureaucratic checklist known as \u201c The Groningen Protocol , \u201d which permits doctors to lethally inject infants under three scenarios :\nThe baby has no chance of survival ( a circumstance that is sometimes misdiagnosed ) ; The baby \u201c may survive after a period of intensive treatment but expectations for their future are very grim \u201d ; The baby does \u201c not depend on technology for physiologic stability \u201d but has \u201c suffering [ that ] is severe , sustained , and can not be alleviated . \u201d\nThus , Dutch doctors not only speed up dying babies \u2019 deaths , but also kill those with serious disabilities who do not need intensive care . Showing the dark currents that are flowing in favor of infanticide , the Groningen Protocol was published with all due respect in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nSome politicians and advocates are slightly less blatant , arguing in support of what could be called infanticide-by-neglect . The most well-known recent example was Virginia Governor Ralph Northam ( D-VA ) , who falsely ( according to a study published by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute ) claimed that late-term abortions are restricted to \u201c cases where there may be severe deformities , there may be a fetus that \u2019 s non-viable. \u201d And if such babies are born alive , Northam was asked in a radio interview . He stated coldly :\nSo , in this particular example , if a mother is in labor , I can tell you exactly what would happen . The infant would be delivered . The infant would be kept comfortable . The infant would be resuscitated if that \u2019 s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother .\nThink about this . The Governor of Virginia endorsed the moral equivalent of the Roman Empire \u2019 s ancient practice of exposing disabled infants on hills \u2014 except that instead of leaving the baby in the weeds to be consumed by animals , the child would be left to die unattended in a bassinette . Awful .\nThe recent open and notorious support for infanticide by society \u2019 s most powerful voices forces us to support , reject , or be openly indifferent to the sanctity of human life . If there is moral accountability in creation , we had better be very careful about what we do next . History will judge us most harshly if we turn a blind eye to the killing of the most weak , defenseless , and innocent among us .\nAward winning author Wesley J.

The Department of Health and Human Services will be announcing its proposal Friday , the official said on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to confirm the plans before the announcement . ( AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The Trump administration acted Friday to bar taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions , energizing its conservative political base ahead of crucial midterm elections while setting the stage for new legal battles .\nThe Health and Human Services Department sent its proposal to rewrite the rules to the White House , setting in motion a regulatory process that could take months . Scant on details , an administration overview of the plan said it would echo a Reagan-era rule by banning abortion referrals by federally funded clinics and forbidding them from locating in facilities that also provide abortions .\nPlanned Parenthood , a principal provider of family planning , abortion services and basic preventive care for women , said the plan appears designed to target the organization . \u201c The end result would make it impossible for women to come to Planned Parenthood , who are counting on us every day , \u201d said executive vice president Dawn Laguens .\nBut presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that the administration is simply recognizing \u201c that abortion is not family planning . This is family planning money . \u201d\nThe policy was derided as a \u201c gag rule \u201d by abortion rights supporters , a point challenged by the administration , which said counseling about abortion would be OK , but not referrals . It \u2019 s likely to trigger lawsuits from opponents , and certain to galvanize activists on both sides of the abortion debate going into November \u2019 s congressional elections .\nThe policy \u201c would ensure that taxpayers do not indirectly fund abortions , \u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement .\nSocial and religious conservatives have remained steadfastly loyal to President Donald Trump despite issues like his reimbursements to attorney Michael Cohen , who paid hush money to a porn star alleging an affair , and Trump \u2019 s past boasts of sexually aggressive behavior . Trump has not wavered from advancing the agenda of the religious right .\nTuesday night , Trump is scheduled to speak at the Susan B. Anthony List \u2019 s \u201c campaign for life \u201d gala . The group works to elect candidates who want to reduce and ultimately end abortion . It says it spent more than $ 18 million in the 2016 election cycle to defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton and promote a \u201c pro-life Senate . \u201d\nThe original Reagan-era family planning rule barred clinics from discussing abortion with women . It never went into effect as written , although the Supreme Court ruled it was an appropriate use of executive power . The policy was rescinded under President Bill Clinton , and a new rule took effect requiring \u201c nondirective \u201d counseling to include a full range of options for women .\nThe Trump administration said its proposal will roll back the Clinton requirement that abortion be discussed as an option along with prenatal care and adoption .\nKnown as Title X , the family-planning program serves about 4 million women a year through clinics , costing taxpayers about $ 260 million .\nAlthough abortion is politically divisive , the U.S. abortion rate has dropped significantly , from about 29 per 1,000 women of reproductive age in 1980 to about 15 in 2014 . Better contraception , fewer unintended pregnancies and state restrictions may have played a role , according to a recent scientific report .\nAbortion remains legal , but federal family planning funds can not be used to pay for the procedure . Planned Parenthood clinics now qualify for Title X family planning grants , but they keep that money separate from funds that pay for abortions .\nAbortion opponents say a taxpayer-funded program should have no connection to abortion . Doctors \u2019 groups and abortion rights supporters say a ban on counseling women trespasses on the doctor-patient relationship .\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the administration action amounts to an \u201c egregious intrusion \u201d in the doctor-patient relationship and could force doctors to omit \u201c essential , medically accurate information \u201d from counseling sessions with patients .\nPlanned Parenthood \u2019 s Laguens hinted at legal action , saying , \u201c we will not stand by while our basic health care and rights are stripped away . \u201d\nJessica Marcella of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association , which represents clinics , said requiring physical separation from abortion facilities is impractical and would disrupt services for women .\n\u201c I can not imagine a scenario in which public health groups would allow this effort to go unchallenged , \u201d Marcella said .\nBut abortion opponents said Trump is merely reaffirming the core mission of the family planning program .\n\u201c The new regulations will draw a bright line between abortion centers and family planning programs , just as ... federal law requires and the Supreme Court has upheld , \u201d said Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , a key voice for religious conservatives .\nKristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America said , \u201c Abortion is not health care or birth control and many women want natural health care choices , rather than hormone-induced changes . \u201d\nAbortion opponents allege the federal family planning program in effect cross-subsidizes abortions provided by Planned Parenthood , whose clinics are also major recipients of grants for family planning and basic preventive care . Hawkins \u2019 group is circulating a petition to urge lawmakers to support the Trump administration \u2019 s proposal .\nAbortion opponents say the administration plan is not a \u201c gag rule. \u201d It \u201c will not prohibit counseling for clients about abortion ... but neither will it include the current mandate that ( clinics ) must counsel and refer for abortion , \u201d said the administration \u2019 s own summary .", "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Just when you think Pope Francis has nothing left up the sleeve of his cassock , he does it again . This time , the popular pontiff has announced that during the Holy Jubilee year beginning this December 8 , priests will have the discretion to forgive penitent Catholic women for having abortions\u2014one of the biggest sins of the Catholic Church .\nIn what has become classic Francis style , he apparently doesn \u2019 t care about the political ramifications of offering limited forgiveness for an act on which entire political campaigns are made and unraveled . Instead , he wrote in a letter to the president of the Pontifical Council of New Evangelization that priests ought to look deep to understand what leads a woman to abort her unborn child .\n\u201c The tragedy of abortion is experienced by some with a superficial awareness , as if not realizing the extreme harm that such an act entails , \u201d said the pope \u2019 s letter . \u201c Many others , on the other hand , although experiencing this moment as a defeat , believe that they have no other option . \u201d\n\u201c I think in particular of all the women who have resorted to abortion , \u201d Francis said . \u201c I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision . I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal . I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision . \u201d\nBy no means , of course , is the pope or the Catholic Church actually endorsing , condoning or somehow approving the ending of a pregnancy at any point after conception . That will never happen . On the contrary , by allowing Catholic women to be absolved from the sin , rather than automatically excommunicating them , as has been the practice , he ensures that they retain their faith . Or , more to the point , return to the pews .\nAt a time when more Catholics are leaving the Church than joining , keeping the faithful on the roster is vital . As we have seen time and time again , on issues like divorced and remarried Catholics , unwed parents , those who use birth control , those living in same-sex unions , Francis seems to be sending the same message that Catholics are welcome no matter how flawed they are or , it would seem , what sins they have committed . That mercy , above all , has been the key to the pope \u2019 s popularity .\nPrior to this decree , the only way a woman could be forgiven for having an abortion was to go directly to the chief confessor in her diocese or the equivalent in certain situations . Now , instead of petitioning a higher prelate , any priest anywhere in the world can do this .\n\u201c The forgiveness of God can not be denied to one who has repented , especially when that person approaches the Sacrament of Confession with a sincere heart in order to obtain reconciliation with the Father , \u201d Francis wrote . \u201c For this reason too , I have decided , notwithstanding anything to the contrary , to concede to all priests for the Jubilee Year the discretion to absolve of the sin of abortion those who have procured it and who , with contrite heart , seek forgiveness for it . \u201d\nWriting in Crux Now , Vatican expert John Allen points out that the move will no doubt be twisted to suit both the pro-life and pro-choice movements . \u201c Some anti-abortion activists may wince at any step , however well-intentioned , which could be seen as reducing the level of moral seriousness the Church attaches to the act , \u201d he writes , adding , \u201c On the other hand , some may be grateful for the reminder that abortion actually triggers excommunication. \u201d The takeaway likely will be that Francis \u2019 s talk about mercy \u201c isn \u2019 t mere rhetoric . \u201d\nWhile there is no statute of limitations on when the forgiven abortion took place , there is a catch . The offer of forgiveness is for a limited time only , starting when the Holy Jubilee kicks off on December 8 , 2015 and ending November 20 , 2016 .", "( CNN ) Donald Trump 's election , and a presumption that he 'll appoint conservative Supreme Court justices , spurred Ohio Republicans to pass what would effectively be the nation 's strictest time-based abortion law , a legislator said .\nOhio lawmakers on Tuesday passed a `` Heartbeat Bill '' that would ban abortions in that state from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected -- which usually occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy .\nThe state 's current law generally bans abortions after a fetus has begun its 20th week of gestation , unless a doctor determines that the fetus is n't viable outside the womb . Exceptions are made if the pregnancy puts the woman 's health at serious risk .\nWhat happens next for the bill , which would prohibit post-heartbeat abortions even in cases of rape or incest , depends on Republican Gov . John Kasich , who , after he receives the legislation , has 10 days to decide whether to veto it .\nState legislators had considered the bill in previous years but it never passed the Senate . So what made the legislature 's Republican majority move now ?\n`` One , a new President , new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic , and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward , '' Ohio Senate President Keith Faber , a Republican from Celina , told reporters after the final vote .\nAsked if he thought the bill would survive a legal challenge , he said : `` I think it has a better chance than it did before . ''\nIf Kasich signs the bill , or if he does nothing within 10 days , the measure would become law early next year . A veto would stop the bill unless three-fifths of the state House and Senate vote for an override .\nShould the bill become law , a court battle likely would ensue . The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio already has said it would press a legal challenge .\nOn Tuesday , the Ohio Legislature sent the bill to Kasich 's desk after a day filled with legislative maneuvering .\nJUST WATCHED Ohio considers Down syndrome abortion ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ohio considers Down syndrome abortion ban 01:43\nEarlier in the day , state Sen. Kris Jordan , a Republican from Ostrander , called for an amendment that added provisions from the House-sponsored `` Heartbeat Bill '' to another measure , House Bill 493 , that sought to streamline the process in which medical professionals report child abuse situations .\n`` We are a pro-life caucus ... , '' Jordan said in a statement . `` The passage of this legislation in the Ohio Senate demonstrates our commitment to protecting the children of Ohio at every stage of life . ''\nThe Senate voted twice : First , they approved 20-11 the decision to tack on the `` Heartbeat Bill '' language onto House Bill 493 . After the amendment passed , the state senators passed the bill with a 21-10 vote that largely went along party lines .\nOhio state Sen. Charleta Tavares , a Columbus Democrat , had planned on voting for the child abuse bill as originally presented , but ultimately voted against it because she opposed the `` Heartbeat Bill '' amendment and change in language .\n`` I believe everyone has a right to their own body , '' Tavares told CNN . `` We allowed a good bill that protects the health and safety of our children to be bastardized into a government takeover of women 's wombs . ''\nAfter the bill went back the House , state representatives easily approved the revised bill 56-39 on Tuesday night . It now goes to Kasich for his signature .\nForty-three states currently restrict abortions , with some exceptions , by time or phase of fetal development .\nSome of those states prohibit abortions after a doctor determines the fetus is viable . There 's no fixed time period in such laws , but the nonprofit American Pregnancy Association says that viability generally can begin as soon as 24 weeks .\nOther states prohibit abortion after a certain time following conception -- as soon as 20 weeks in some states .\nBecause heartbeats develop at around six weeks , Ohio 's bill appears to offer what would be the country 's shortest window for abortions .\nAt least two other states -- Arkansas and North Dakota -- passed fetal heartbeat abortion laws . But those measures were found to be unconstitutional in federal court .\nEmmalee Kalmbach , a former Ohio Right to Life staffer who is now Kasich 's press secretary , said the governor does not typically comment on pending legislation .\nEarlier this year , Kasich told CNN that he was `` pro-life with the exceptions of rape , incest and the life of the mother . ''\nAnd earlier this year Kasich signed a bill to ban the state from contracting for health services with any organization that performs or promotes abortions -- a measure widely seen as a way to defund Planned Parenthood .\nThe Columbus Dispatch and the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Kasich expressed concerns about previous attempts to pass a `` Heartbeat Bill , '' including that it may not withstand legal challenges .\nMike Gonidakis , president of Ohio Right to Life , said his group is neutral on the bill because it does n't believe the measure would hold up in federal court .\n`` We believe in an incremental approach , '' Gonidakis said . `` When you overreach , sometimes the courts get the last say . There 's a reason why no state has a 'Heartbeat Bill ' yet . ''\nThis might not be the only abortion restriction law to reach Kasich 's desk this month .\nSenate Bill 127 would prohibit abortions at the 20th week of gestation , except those necessary to prevent serious health problems for the woman . The Senate already has passed it , and the House may vote on it this week .\nGonidakis said he believes that bill has a greater chance of surviving court challenges , in part because other states have such a restriction .\nTavares said she hopes Kasich would line-item veto the `` Heartbeat Bill '' language .\nThe Heartbeat Bill has been called `` unconstitutional '' by members of both parties in the past , Tavares said . Though it passed the state House over a year ago , it previously met opposition in the Senate . On the heels of Donald Trump 's election , momentum for the bill 's approval resurfaced .\nThe ACLU of Ohio tweeted , `` Just a reminder , if the unconstitutional # HeartBeatBill passes and becomes law , we will challenge it in court . ''\nOhio state Sen. Joe Schiavoni , a Democrat from Boardman , said the bill would lead to `` expensive lawsuits '' that would divert resources away from more pressing issues like the opioid crisis .\n`` To the taxpayers of Ohio , I am sorry that your money will have to be used to defend this bill in the court system . ''\nJohn Fortney , a spokesman for the Senate 's Republican caucus , said that `` as far as the threat of abortion advocates suing , we do n't base our decisions on protecting the lives of babies on the threat of someone threatening to file a lawsuit . ''\nPresident-elect Trump has expressed interest in reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark decision that made abortion legal nationwide .\nTrump will get to nominate at least one justice during his term to fill the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia , who died in February . Scalia was known for dissenting opinions on abortion rights .\nIn an interview with `` 60 Minutes '' last month , Trump said opposition to abortion would be a criteria for nominating justices .\nBut replacing Scalia with someone of the same mold alone may not change the status quo . In June , the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 against a Texas abortion access law that opponents argued would have shut down all but a handful of clinics , with perennial swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court 's four liberal justices .\nCORRECTION : An earlier version of this story incorrectly described current Ohio abortion law . The current law prohibits most abortions of viable fetuses . Doctors are required to test for viability beginning at 20 weeks ' gestation .", "When the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton first published their research on \u201c deaths of despair \u201d five years ago , they focused on middle-aged whites . So many white working-class Americans in their 40s and 50s were dying of suicide , alcoholism and drug abuse that the overall mortality rate for the age group was no longer falling \u2013 a rare and shocking pattern in a modern society .\nBut as Case and Deaton continued digging into the data , it became clear that the grim trends didn \u2019 t apply only to middle-aged whites . Up and down the age spectrum , deaths of despair have been surging for people without a four-year college degree :\nDeaths from alcohol , drugs and suicide 5 per 100K 147 per 100K\nIn the early 1990s , the number of white adults without a college education who were dying from a drug overdose , alcoholism or suicide was fairly low \u2014 and the death rates for younger adults were lower than for older adults . But over the past three decades , deaths of despair among whites without a college degree \u2014 especially those under age 50 \u2014 have soared . The death rate for whites with a college degree , by contrast , has risen only modestly across all age groups and remains lower for the young than the old .\nCase and Deaton \u2014 a married couple who are both economists at Princeton \u2014 try to explain the causes in a new book , \u201c Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism. \u201d Their basic answer is that working-class life in the United States is more difficult than it is in any other high-income country . \u201c European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have , and they \u2019 re not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drugs or alcohol , \u201d Case says . \u201c There is something unique about the way the U.S. is handling this . \u201d\nMore people are dying Number of \u201c deaths of despair \u201d per 100,000 non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 Non- college 100 50 College grads 0 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 Non- college 100 50 College grads 0 1992 \u2018 96 \u2018 00 \u2018 04 \u2018 08 \u2018 12 \u2018 16\nInequality has risen more in the United States \u2014 and middle-class incomes have stagnated more severely \u2014 than in France , Germany , Japan or elsewhere . Large corporations have increased their market share , and labor unions have shriveled , leaving workers with little bargaining power . Outsourcing has become the norm , which means that executives often see low-wage workers not as colleagues but as expenses .\nAnd the United States suffers from by far the world \u2019 s most expensive health-care system . It acts as a tax on workers and drains resources that could otherwise be spent on schools , day care , roads , public transit and more . Despite its unparalleled spending , the American medical system also fails to keep many people healthy .\n[ Make sense of the news with David \u2019 s commentary and reading suggestions every weekday morning . Sign up for his newsletter . ]\nThe two economists initially focused on non-Hispanic whites because the mortality trends were worst for them . Deaths rates from suicide , alcoholism and drug abuse among whites surpassed the rates for blacks shortly after 2000 , for example . But the black working class is hardly thriving -- and deaths of despair have surged among them in the last few years . Overall life expectancy remains significantly higher for whites than blacks . So , of course , do incomes and wealth .\nMany of the problems afflicting the working class span racial groups , and Case and Deaton emphasize that these problems aren \u2019 t merely financial . Life for many middle- and low-income Americans can lack structure , status and meaning . People don \u2019 t always know what days or hours they will be working the following week . They often don \u2019 t officially work for the company where they spend their days , which robs them of the pride that comes from being part of a shared enterprise .\n\u201c Many people used to associate the meaning of their life with what their corporation or institution was doing , \u201d says Deaton , a Nobel laureate in economics . Miners and factory workers identified themselves as such . Warehouse workers , especially those whose paycheck is signed by a staffing company , rarely feel the same connection .\nThe result of these trends has been a \u201c coming apart , \u201d as Case and Deaton put it , of day-to-day life for whites without a college degree versus those with a college degree :\nMarriage rates have diverged Share of non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 currently married 80 % College grads 70 Non- college 60 50 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 80 % College grads 70 Non- college 60 50 1980 \u2018 90 \u2018 00 \u2018 10\nPeople without college degrees are also less likely to attend church Share of non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 attending church weekly 30 % College grads 25 Non- college 20 15 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 30 % College grads 25 Non- college 20 15 1975 \u2018 85 \u2018 95 \u2018 05 \u2018 15\nSurveys show that a growing number of working-class Americans find it difficult to do basic things , like climb a flight of stairs or socialize , partly because of chronic problems with their mental or physical health :\nChronic pain is more widespread Share of non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 experiencing neck , back or joint pain 60 % Non- college 50 College grads 40 30 20 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 60 % Non- college 50 College grads 40 30 20 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014\nMany people are also drinking more Average number of drinks ( on days when drinking ) among non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 Non- college 2.5 2.0 College grads 1.5 1.0 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Non- college 2.5 2.0 College grads 1.5 1.0 1994 \u2018 98 \u2018 02 \u2018 06 \u2018 10 \u2018 14\nAnd they are unhappier Share of non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 who say they are \u201c not too happy these days \u201d Non- college 15 % 10 College grads 5 0 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Non- college 15 % 10 College grads 5 0 1975 \u2018 85 \u2018 95 \u2018 05 \u2018 15\nGiven all of these alarming social indicators , it \u2019 s not surprising that some other causes of death \u2014 in addition to suicide , alcoholism and drug overdose \u2014 have also started rising for Americans without a college degree . Heart disease is the most significant , exacerbated by obesity , drinking and drug use .\nThe combined result is a divergence in the life expectancy of white college graduates and non-graduates . Overall mortality for whites between the ages of 45 and 54 has held roughly steady in the last 25 years . But that average hides a big increase in death rates for non-graduates and a big decline for graduates .\nWhat can be done about all of this ? Many of the solutions are obvious , if difficult to accomplish . The medical system should be overhauled to put a higher priority on health than on wealth for people who work in the industry , Case and Deaton argue . ( And that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean a mandatory version of Medicare , they add . )\nThe federal government should do a better job of keeping big business from maximizing profits at the expense of their workers , by enforcing antitrust laws and encouraging new kinds of labor unions . Governments at all levels should help more people earn college degrees , both four-year degrees ( like B.A. \u2019 s ) and meaningful vocational degrees .\nOther economic research has found that a college degree isn \u2019 t simply a marker . Students who attend and graduate from college do better in life than otherwise similar students who didn \u2019 t get the same opportunities . Graduates are more likely to be employed , earn more , marry and stay married , be satisfied with their lives , be healthy and live longer . These findings suggest that college itself \u2014 both the classroom learning and the experience of successfully navigating college \u2014 brings long-term benefits .\nThe focus of Case and Deaton \u2019 s book isn \u2019 t education , but it lingers as the backdrop to all of their findings . \u201c This B.A./non-B.A . divide , \u201d Deaton says , \u201c just comes up again and again and again . \u201d", "More than a third of opioid-related deaths in the United States link back to long-acting drugs like OxyContin that are approved for prescription by the US Food and Drug Administration . But lax oversight at the agency is hampering efforts to ensure doctors don \u2019 t overprescribe these medications , according to a new study .\nThe FDA has failed to adequately track whether one of its key strategies for addressing opioid misuse has been effective .\nResearchers from Johns Hopkins University scoured thousands of pages of internal FDA documents , obtained through public records requests , and found that the agency has failed to adequately track whether one of its key strategies for addressing opioid misuse has been effective . The study , published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine , looks at a federal program that teaches doctors about the risks of prescribing addictive opioids .\nStarting in 2012 , the FDA \u2019 s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program required opioid makers to pay for this training for doctors prescribing long-acting opioids , and to monitor whether it had an impact on overdoses and deaths . But according to the internal documents surfaced by the Johns Hopkins researchers , it appears the FDA has not been able to show that its training program worked : Opioid makers did not collect the right data to track how the training was going , and even after the FDA discovered this , according to the Johns Hopkins researchers , the agency did not correct the problem .\n\u201c What \u2019 s surprising here is the design of the program was deficient from the start , \u201d Caleb Alexander , an author on the study , told the New York Times . As early as 2013 , the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services warned that the FDA was \u201c not receiving crucial information from pharmaceutical manufactures \u201d about the training . \u201c It \u2019 s unclear why the FDA didn \u2019 t insist upon a more scientifically rigorous evaluation of this safety program . \u201d\nSome of the data that was collected isn \u2019 t encouraging . The goal was for 60 percent of doctors who prescribe long-acting opioids to enroll in a training class , but only 27 percent of them did between 2012 and 2016 , the Johns Hopkins study found . Manufacturers also surveyed physicians who participated in the training , and concluded they had \u201c modestly greater \u201d knowledge of safe prescribing practices , but these surveys came at a time when opioid prescribing rates were dropping overall in the United States , and they were not designed to prove the classes were responsible for the change .\nNearly 50,000 people around the country died from opioid overdoses in 2017 .\nResponding to the study , an FDA spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the issue of opioid misuse was a top priority for the Trump administration , and that assessing the impact of the training program while accounting for other opioid interventions at the municipal , state , and federal levels could be be challenging . He said that after learning about difficulties with the data assessment , the agency talked with drug manufacturers about how to better study the effect of the training on prescriber behavior and patient outcomes , and that it continues to work with these companies to evaluate the impact of the program . He noted that the agency has also taken other steps to curb the epidemic , like going after illegal imports and sales of opioids and supporting more treatment for people struggling with addiction .\nAfter reaching a peak in 2012 , opioid prescription rates fell in 2017\u2014to 58.7 prescriptions per 100 people nationally , compared with 81.3 prescriptions per 100 people in 2012 . But rates are still high in certain parts of the country , the researchers warned . And while deaths are now starting to drop , nearly 50,000 people around the country died from opioid overdoses in 2017 , a record high .", "In 2019 , The Legal Fight Over Opioids Unraveled Into Confusion And Infighting\nLegal experts expected this to be the year we answered big questions about the liability that drug companies face for the deadly opioid epidemic and for their role in marketing high-risk prescription pain medications .\nInstead , the legal fight over who will pay to clean up the addiction crisis dissolved into confusion and infighting .\n`` I do n't know if there 's a clear road map , '' said Adam Zimmerman , a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert in opioid litigation .\nAll sides agree the stakes are high . Every day , 130 Americans die from opioid overdoses , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Without some kind of national settlement with Big Pharma , communities wo n't get serious money to help with the crisis any time soon . Speaking this fall with reporters , Pennsylvania state Attorney General Josh Shapiro warned that there could be legal chaos .\n`` We will randomly and haphazardly litigate these cases , with no particular rhyme or reason , '' Shapiro said . `` The needs of people across this country will not be met . ''\nFor much of 2019 , a deal seemed close . Federal Judge Dan Polster in Ohio was holding high-level settlement talks while at the same time channeling thousands of civil lawsuits against the drug industry into a tidy legal pipeline .\nThen came a big federal case in Polster 's court in October that was expected to test the liability of drugmakers and distributors . At the very last minute , however , companies reached a local settlement with a couple of Ohio counties . The trial was abruptly called off .\nGreg McNeil , an activist whose son died from an opioid overdose in 2015 , told NPR outside the courthouse in Cleveland that he was flattened .\n`` We have no admission of wrongdoing , '' McNeil said . `` It seems as if nothing is changing . ''\nEven attorneys involved in the case acknowledged that the outcome left big questions unanswered .\n`` We do n't have a chance to test the legal theories that are being used here , if they are being properly used , what there limits are , '' said Mark Lanier who represents communities suing Big Pharma .\nSettlement talks aimed at reaching a deal with the pharmaceutical industry comparable to the tobacco settlement of the 1990s also splintered , with Polster still leading negotiations in Ohio while state attorneys general across the country pushed for a separate deal . Neither set of talks produced a `` global '' resolution .\nAdam Zimmerman at Loyola thinks it made sense for Polster and others to push for a big settlement this year , but it just did n't pay off .\n`` The opioid crisis has just presented such an emergency and it 's called for quick action , '' Zimmerman said . `` To the extent that it has n't worked , I do n't think that 's necessarily the fault of Judge Polster as much as just the extremely complicated nature of this litigation . ''\nThousands of states , local governments , school districts and Native American tribes have sued drug companies for aggressively marketing prescription opioid medications while allegedly downplaying the risks of addiction and overdose . More than 400,000 Americans have died during the epidemic that began in the 1990s .\nThe legal muddle that remains is scary for those cash-strapped towns and cities . It also leaves a big cloud over the pharmaceutical industry . In August , a state judge in Oklahoma found Johnson & Johnson liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for `` misleading '' marketing of prescription opioids . Johnson & Johnson is appealing that decision , but it was a shot across the bow for drug companies , a sign that courts across the U.S. might rule in favor of communities\nA month later , in September , the avalanche of lawsuits pushed Purdue Pharma , another big opioid-maker over the edge . The company filed for structured bankruptcy , with the company 's owners , the Sackler family , offering to pay roughly $ 3 billion of their personal cash to help communities and giving up control of the firm to settle all opioid-related claims .\nBut here again , there 's a fight underway . Some states agreed to the deal , while others sued members of the Sackler family directly , accusing them of pulling more than $ 12 billion out of Purdue Pharma and hiding much of it in offshore accounts .\n`` I do n't see how states can basically sign on to a settlement without knowing the valuation of how much resources the Sacklers have in their position , how much they 're worth and or the worth of Purdue , '' said Attorney General Letitia James of New York .\nWhat this all adds up to is more uncertainty and more opioid trials next year , including another federal case scheduled for Polster 's court in Cleveland that will test the liability of big pharmacy chains CVS , Walgreens and Rite Aid , which sold opioids in huge quantities to their customers .\nMeanwhile , thousands of cities and small towns will keep scrambling to pay for the overdose medications , rehab and supportive housing programs that keep people alive .", "\u201c You might say one of the essential functions the courts can play is where one party can hold another to account , \u201d says Adam Zimmerman , an associate professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles . \u201c To not have some kind of adjudication about what happened and who did what and who \u2019 s responsible , it feels like something \u2019 s lost there . \u201d\nIn a crisis that has killed about 400,000 Americans and cost the country an estimated $ 504 billion in 2015 alone , settlements help ease the financial burdens on cities and states . But some say accountability is key .\nLast week , a Boston jury convicted five executives of opioid manufacturer Insys of racketeering charges , including bribing doctors to prescribe its opioid medication to patients who didn \u2019 t need it . West Virginia and Oklahoma have settled lawsuits with McKesson and Purdue Pharma , for $ 37 million and $ 270 million respectively . Both companies denied wrongdoing .\nWhat does justice look like in the opioid crisis ? Three recent decisions in bellwether lawsuits offer different models of how best to move forward and help individuals and communities rebuild as more than 1,600 lawsuits chug through America \u2019 s legal system .\nAs hundreds of lawsuits against opioid manufacturers , distributors , and retailers chug through the U.S. legal system , a trio of recent decisions gives a hint of what may be coming .\nOn May 2 , a Boston jury convicted the onetime billionaire CEO of Insys Therapeutics and four former executives on racketeering charges , in connection with bribing doctors to prescribe opioid medication to patients who didn \u2019 t need it and deceiving insurers into paying for it .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s convictions mark the first successful prosecution of top pharmaceutical executives for crimes related to the illicit marketing and prescribing of opioids , \u201d said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling in a statement . \u201c Just as we would street-level drug dealers , we will hold pharmaceutical executives responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic by recklessly and illegally distributing these drugs , especially while conspiring to commit racketeering along the way . \u201d\nThe same day , West Virginia settled for $ 37 million with McKesson Corp. , the country \u2019 s largest pharmaceutical distributor . And in March , Oklahoma settled with manufacturer Purdue Pharma , for $ 270 million . These settlements could provide a blueprint for more than 1,600 opioid lawsuits pending in courts around the country , most of which have been consolidated under a federal judge in Cleveland .\nWhile the substantial payouts will help states fund treatment and other services , the drug companies involved in both settlements have denied any wrongdoing , and experts say the settlement amounts are not large enough to change corporate behavior . That underscores a key question : What does justice look like ? Is it most important that drug companies are held accountable , or compelled to change ? That the public understands where the blame lies , and why ? Or is it more important that resources to combat the problem are mobilized so the suffering can end ?\n\u201c You might say one of the essential functions the courts can play is where one party can hold another to account , \u201d says Adam Zimmerman , an associate professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and an expert in the type of multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) being used in Cleveland . \u201c To not have some kind of adjudication about what happened and who did what and who \u2019 s responsible , it feels like something \u2019 s lost there . \u201d\nBut for communities struggling to cover the tremendous public costs of the opioid crisis , from staffing for 911 calls to overdose-reversal drugs to treatment facilities , settlement payouts provide urgently needed funds .\nSteven Senne/AP Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor leaves federal court in Boston on Jan. 30 , 2019 . He and four other former company executives were found guilty in May of bribing doctors to prescribing a powerful fentanyl painkiller to patients who did not need it .\nAt the first hearing in the opioid MDL , Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland declared that his objective was \u201c to do something meaningful to abate this crisis , and to do so in 2018. \u201d While he has missed his self-imposed deadline , he has sought a global settlement that would enable communities to rebuild \u2013 rather than getting bogged down in years of litigation .\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey also sought to settle quickly rather than await the uncertainty and likely delays of a trial . His office says that the McKesson payout is the largest won from any pharmaceutical distributor in the country , and tops the state \u2019 s previous settlements with Cardinal Health ( $ 20 million ) and Amerisource Bergen ( $ 16 million ) . In total , the attorney general has now won $ 84 million from more than a dozen distributors , bolstering his efforts to reduce the supply and demand of opioids .\nBut for some in West Virginia , the McKesson settlement amount pales in comparison to the devastating impact of the opioid epidemic .\n\u201c I thought it was a joke , \u201d says Justin Marcum , a former state legislator and lawyer involved in the MDL . \u201c Big Pharma has basically just ruined America and targeted the innocent , working people . \u201d\nThose people include the 400 or so residents of Kermit , a coal town in Mingo County that Mr. Marcum represented in the statehouse until last year .\nIn 2006 and 2007 , McKesson supplied nearly 5 million doses of hydrocodone to a single pharmacy in Kermit . The attorney general \u2019 s complaint against McKesson calculates that its supply of hydrocodone and other prescription opioids to Mingo County in 2007 was enough to provide every patient with a dose every hour and 15 minutes . Physicians can not prescribe more than one dose every four hours .\nThe complaint charges that the state \u201c has been damaged by the Defendant \u2019 s intentional and reckless actions in failing to investigate , report , and cease fulfilling suspicious orders \u201d across the state . McKesson denied it was liable , and the settlement says the deal is not to be construed as an admission by the company of any \u201c wrongdoing , negligence , or failure to comply with any law or regulation . \u201d\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin , who served as governor from 2005 to 2010 , called the settlement a \u201c sweetheart deal \u201d that sells out the state and prevents it from recouping billions of dollars in damages .\nAttorney General Morrisey \u2019 s press secretary , Curtis Johnson , dismisses that as political hypocrisy .\n\u201c While Attorney General Morrisey and subsequent governors have fought to realize historic recoveries from drug distributors , it seems [ Mr. ] Manchin \u2019 s most significant impact in the opioid epidemic was the record breaking numbers of pills he allowed to proliferate throughout the state during his watch , \u201d said Mr. Johnson .\nMr. Morrisey has fashioned himself as a fighter who is cleaning up West Virginia , bringing more accountability and record settlement amounts . He launched the lawsuit against McKesson and sued the Drug Enforcement Administration over quotas on opioid pill production .\nBut before coming to office , Mr. Morrisey earned $ 250,000 for lobbying Congress on behalf of an association of drug distributors , though not on opioid issues . His wife , meanwhile , is listed on disclosure forms for lobbying on legislation to tighten restrictions around the prescription opioid hydrocodone , dubbed America \u2019 s No . 1 most abused drug . The bill failed , but the federal government enacted the change the following year .\nUnder Mr. Morrisey , the flow of opioid pills into West Virginia has dropped 35 percent . But overdose deaths have risen to more than 800 per year as addicts have turned to heroin and fentanyl .\nSOURCE : Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , National Center for Health Statistics | Jacob Turcotte/Staff\nChelsea Carter , who was addicted to opioids as a teenager but turned her life around and now serves as lead therapist at Ohio Valley Health in Logan County , says drug companies should acknowledge that they pushed drugs into West Virginia and provide money for treatment . But , she adds , it would be wrong to pin the blame on drug companies alone .\n\u201c Everybody has to take responsibility , from the drug companies to the pharmacies to the doctors to the people who take the drugs and get addicted , \u201d she says . \u201c The only difference is they [ the drug companies ] have the money to try to help the problem instead of making the problem worse . \u201d\nMcKesson is one of the wealthiest corporations in the world and is ranked sixth on the Fortune 500 list , ahead of Amazon . Its annual revenue in 2018 was $ 198 billion .\n\u201c McKesson is committed to working with others to end this national crisis , however , and is pleased that the settlement provides funding toward initiatives intended to address the opioid epidemic , \u201d the company said in a statement last week , noting that the funds it is paying to West Virginia are aimed at rehabilitation , job training , and mental health , among other areas .\nSettlements can have an avalanche effect , providing a framework and baseline that leads to more settlements , which can boost subsequent efforts \u2013 or limit them , if early settlements set too low a bar .\n\u201c We see this movement [ of settlements ] as helpful , certainly , but we haven \u2019 t even begun to see the types of settlements that are necessary to start to impact this epidemic and to change the practices \u201d of drug manufacturers , distributors , and chain pharmacies , says Jayne Conroy , a partner at Simmons Hanly Conroy , a firm representing plaintiffs in the MDL .\nA study from the American Enterprise Institute in Washington estimates the opioid crisis \u2019 s annual cost to West Virginia \u2019 s economy at more than $ 8 billion , including lost productivity of those who have died . Nationwide , the crisis has killed 399,202 people from 1999 to 2017 , taking an economic toll of more than $ 500 billion on the country .\n\u201c It seems to me even if the drug companies pay a large amount of money , $ 20 to 30 billion , that \u2019 s chicken feed compared to the social costs of the addiction problem , \u201d says Richard Ausness , a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who has been following opioid lawsuits across the country .\nThe Oklahoma case comes closest to what most experts and lawyers consider the ideal outcome in a settlement of this nature : a large payout that not only compensates plaintiffs but also makes a significant investment toward stemming the crisis that prompted the lawsuit in the first place .\nThat the case involved Purdue Pharma , maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin , could be significant . The manufacturer \u2013 and its owners , the Sackler family \u2013 have emerged as the \u201c the poster child for really bad corporate behavior , \u201d according to Professor Ausness , while distributors like McKesson have had a lower profile .\nPart of that is due to their different roles in the supply chain , with Purdue manufacturing opioids and McKesson distributing them . The claims being made against them , and the standards of proof and possible penalties , are thus different as well .\nAs allegations of Purdue \u2019 s role in fueling the opioid epidemic have emerged , there have been protests outside the company \u2019 s Connecticut headquarters , museums have begun turning down Sackler family donations , and mothers of victims have asked Harvard University to remove the Sackler family name from campus buildings . Oklahoma had initially sought billions of dollars in damages in its case against Purdue and the other defendants .\nFor Purdue , Professor Ausness says , the Oklahoma settlement \u201c is a small step , maybe , to rehabilitating their reputation . \u201d\nWhile not a party to the Oklahoma lawsuit against Purdue , the Sackler family voluntarily pledged $ 75 million toward the addiction research and treatment center being established through the settlement .\n\u201c We have profound compassion for those who are affected by addiction and are committed to playing a constructive role in the coordinated effort to save lives , \u201d the family said in a statement after the settlement .\nThat kind of long-term approach to healing root causes of the crisis did not happen in the $ 200 billion Big Tobacco settlement in 1998 , says Professor Ausness \u2013 though funds from the 1998 settlement do fund an anti-smoking advocacy group .\nBut other states don \u2019 t seem as willing to settle . \u201c We will continue to aggressively pursue our case against Purdue and the Sackler family , \u201d said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in a statement to the Monitor . \u201c Families in Massachusetts and across the country deserve answers and accountability from this company and its executives and directors . \u201d\nOn May 28 , Oklahoma is slated to become the first state to go to trial against opioid companies , confronting remaining defendants Johnson & Johnson , Allergan , and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA .\nTrials and convictions can bring that sense of accountability , especially when , as is the case with the convictions of the five former Insys executives this month , it could involve prison time . Having to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is such a high standard , however , that criminal charges have been rare in opioid litigation so far .\n\u201c I \u2019 m hopeful that we \u2019 ll see more criminal convictions of executives for opioid manufacturers in the future , \u201d says Andrew Kolodny , an M.D . at Brandeis University who is involved in the Oklahoma case . \u201c If you want to deter corporations from killing people in their pursuit of profit , I believe criminal prosecutions are required . I don \u2019 t think fines and civil litigations are adequate . They can be seen as the cost of doing business . \u201d", "The Sackler family , which owns Purdue Pharma , used Swiss and other hidden bank accounts to transfer around $ 1 billion from the company to themselves , the New York attorney general \u2019 s office claimed Friday .\nThe family stands to lose billions after a litany of lawsuits claiming that their company marketed the painkiller OxyContin as nonaddictive despite knowing otherwise .\nThe transfers support allegations by New York and other states that the Sacklers have worked to shield their wealth in the face of mounting legal threats .\nThose transfers include $ 20 million from a Purdue parent company to former board member Mortimer D.A . Sackler , who then redirected the money to shell companies that own homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons , prosecutors said . Another $ 64 million came to Sackler from a previously unknown family trust , by way of a Swiss account .\nThe New York attorney general 's office has already rejected a tentative settlement with the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma , arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company \u2019 s and the Sackler \u2019 s supposed roles in kick-starting the prescription opioid crisis that has killed 400,000 Americans over the past two decades , according to the CDC .\nGAMER SENTENCED TO 15 MONTHS IN FEDERAL PRISON IN DEADLY 'SWATTING ' CASE\n`` While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement , we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct . The limited number of documents provided to us so far underscore the necessity for compliance with every subpoena , '' said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement .\nAs part of the settlement , Purdue is likely to file for bankruptcy protection . But New York and other states have promised they will continue to pursue the Sacklers , alleging that family members drained more than $ 4 billion from the company over the past dozen years . The Sacklers have used a complex chain of companies and trusts to control their holdings , some located in offshore tax havens .\nThe Sacklers had an estimated net worth of $ 13 billion as of 2016 , making them America 's 19th-richest family , according to Forbes magazine .\nThis does not include the amount many believe is hidden away .\nIn its filing Friday , New York told a state judge that the only way it can determine the full extent of those transfers is if all those it has subpoenaed are forced to provide documents detailing their interactions with the Sackler family . James has issued subpoenas to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers with ties to the Sacklers .", "For the first time in more than a half century , life expectancy declined for two consecutive years in the United States .\nThe CDC reports that \u201c accidental injuries \u201d rising to third on the list of killer categories helped account for the shortening of American lives . Neither a spike in banana-peel misadventures nor a spate of missing manhole covers led to this epidemic of misfortune . The use of opioids , which the medical profession prescribes to relieve pain , dramatically increased . Overdoses constitute a massive portion of \u201c accidental injuries . \u201d\nThe Barack Obama presidency coincided with Americans using large amounts of dangerous narcotics ( people coped in their own ways ) and the suicide rate ( alas , some could not cope ) ballooning to its highest level in three decades .\nAmericans , apparently , felt more pain in recent years and took drastic measures to relieve such feelings that unfortunately resulted in many deaths , which , of course , caused even more pain , which resulted in people seeking relief from that pain , and so on .\nOstensibly a medical problem , the drug boom really stems from a spiritual decay . People reach for heroin and oxycontin and the rest after a hollowing out . Before one attempts to fill a void , emptiness must occur .\nMaterial hopelessness appears as one , and just one , likely contributing factor to the spiritual rot . Americans suffered through economic growth under Obama more anemic than for any postwar president . Whereas postwar GDP growth averaged 2.9 percent annually , no year under Obama even approached that mediocre number . And to achieve this paltry growth , the government compiled massive debts . The debt-to-GDP ratio reached the highest point in Obama \u2019 s lifetime under Obama . The national debt doubled in eight years .\nPolitical leaders during this era dubbed their policies as \u201c progressive. \u201d This strikes as a cruel irony . Is it progress that more Americans kill themselves , voluntarily via a rope and rickety stool and involuntarily through needles and pills , than they did in the past ? I once heard Joe Sobran say that if the termites eating your house could speak , and you asked them the question \u201c What are you doing ? \u201d they would exclaim : \u201c Progress ! \u201d From the perspective of the termites , devouring a house stands as momentous progress . Likewise , many decidedly non-termite humans regard the Obama years as progressive , even if too often the economy , the deficit , our medical bills , and even our lifespans went in the wrong direction .\nWhen Ronald Reagan dubbed , \u201c I \u2019 m from the government and I \u2019 m here to help , \u201d the most terrifying words in the English language , he spoke from experience and observation . But he also spoke as a prophet .\nEven before President Obama tried to help you with your hospital bills through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 an unintentionally hilarious moniker \u2014 George W. Bush imagined it the government \u2019 s duty to buy people drugs through the Medicare Part D entitlement .\nA study published last year in Health Affairs notes , \u201c Consumer out-of-pocket spending on opioids per 100 morphine milligram equivalents ( a standard reference measure of strength for various opioids ) declined from $ 4.40 to $ 0.90 between 2001 and 2012 . Since the implementation of Medicare Part D in 2006 , Medicare has been the largest payer for opioid pain relievers , covering about 20\u201330 percent of the cost . Medicare spends considerably more on these drugs for enrollees younger than age sixty-five than it does for any other age group or than Medicaid or private insurance does for any age group . \u201d\nSo , Americans pay for one government program to buy opioids for addicts and pay for another government program to tell us that the rise in opioid addiction led to a decline in lifespans . This is the progressive state in action , managers deciding who and what gets subsidized and experts studying , if unconsciously so , the effects . And neither group lifts their noses from their narrow task to make sense of the big picture .\n\u201c If you are on the wrong road , progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road , \u201d C.S . Lewis famously wrote in Mere Christianity , \u201c and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man . \u201d\nAmerica requires reorientation , not \u201c progress \u201d \u2014 particularly not progress of an ideological sort divorced from the word \u2019 s meaning . Sometimes progress requires , as Dorothy taught us , going home .\nIt is perhaps too much to expect perhaps the most abnormal man ever to sit in the Oval Office to engineer a \u201c return to normalcy , \u201d as did the last Republican tasked with putting America \u2019 s house in order after the wreckage left by progressive termites . But Trump \u2019 s instincts , as his tax bill indicates , favor more individual control than administrative control over lives . People taking responsibility for their own lives , in contrast to government meddling and intrusiveness , goes a long way toward solving problems , drug problems and otherwise .\nAlas , even material improvements will not wean Americans off opioids . If you doubt this , give each addict you meet a $ 100 bill and see where he or she spends it . They need goals , spiritual direction , will , and much else the state can not provide .\nGovernment exacerbated this problem . It can help alleviate it . It can not solve it .", "A US lawmaker investigating alleged Russian election meddling says an ex-Trump aide should testify on wild claims he has made about the president .\nMr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware of a 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian lawyer , and may have `` done something '' during the campaign .\nDemocrat Adam Schiff responded by saying his congressional panel `` needs to explore '' Mr Nunberg 's allegation .\nMr Nunberg is the latest figure to become embroiled in the Russia inquiry .\n`` Certainly if Mr Nunberg has light to shed about what the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting , we would like to find out , '' Mr Schiff said , referring to his House Intelligence Committee 's investigation on Monday night .\nUS President Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of that meeting , which has become a central focus of a separate inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin .\nCongressman Mike Conway , who serves as leading chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , dismissed the idea of calling Mr Nunberg to testify , saying of the Trump Tower meeting : `` I think we 've pretty much explored that to death . ''\nMr Nunberg told the New York Daily News on Tuesday he is contemplating seeking treatment for alcohol abuse , a day after his extraordinary series of interviews on live television .\nHe complained to US media on Monday about being asked to share his email conversations with a long list of ex-campaign aides in response to a subpoena from Mr Mueller 's team .\nThe political operative , who helped launch Donald Trump 's presidential campaign before losing his job in 2015 , said in a round of media interviews at first he would not comply with Mr Mueller 's demand to testify before a grand jury .\nBut he later told the Associated Press he would probably end up complying .\n`` I think it would be really , really funny if they wanted to arrest me because I do n't want to spend 80 hours going over emails , '' he told MSNBC .\nWhile he thought investigators believed they had something on Mr Trump , he argued that the subpoena was unfair and added he would like Robert Mueller 's team to narrow its scope of inquiry .\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders would not be drawn on Mr Nunberg 's remarks , saying : `` I 'm not going to weigh in on somebody that does n't work at the White House . ''\nSam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year over racially charged Facebook posts .\nHe was later sued by Mr Trump for $ 10m ( \u00a37.2m ) for breach of confidentiality .\nThe lawsuit was `` amicably settled '' out of court , a lawyer for the Trump Organization said at the time .\nMr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware at the time of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when a group of Russians offered his campaign staff damaging information about Hillary Clinton .\n`` You know he knew about it , '' Mr Nunberg told CNN . `` He was talking about it a week before . I do n't know why he went around trying to hide it . ''\nThe White House has repeatedly denied Mr Trump knew anything about that meeting .\nDuring Monday 's interviews with US media , Mr Nunberg said he had met Mr Mueller 's team for five-and-a-half hours over the weekend .\nHe said he would not appear before a grand jury to testify on Friday .\n`` I 'm not co-operating . Arrest me , '' Mr Nunberg said on live television . `` You want to arrest me ? Arrest me . ''\nAt times during the interviews , Mr Nunberg appeared to contradict himself .\nHe said : `` Trump may very well have done something during the election with the Russians . If he did that , I do n't know . ''\nBut Mr Nunberg also told CNN 's Jake Tapper : `` It 's the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians . ''", "The Obama administration \u2014 despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system \u2014 secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars , an investigative report by the Senate has revealed .\nA copy of the report , obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction , all while misleading lawmakers about the activities .\nThe document , compiled by the Senate \u2019 s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee , began circulating Tuesday , just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington \u2019 s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump \u2019 s withdrawal from the nuclear deal .\n\u201c Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks , and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions , \u201d said Sigal Mandelker , Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence .\nShe also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against \u201c deceptive \u201d Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists .\nThe Iranian government \u201c uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks \u201d as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran \u2019 s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization , Ms. Mandelker said .\nShe issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities \u2014 the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump \u2019 s pullout from the nuclear accord .\nIranian officials said the increase , while provocative , does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord .\nThe president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions , which the U.S. , Europe , China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran \u2019 s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections .\nWhile Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal , the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded . The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump \u2019 s withdrawal .\nThe head of Iran \u2019 s nuclear agency , Ali Akbar Salehi , said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges . He made the comment a day after Iran \u2019 s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord .\nThe Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama \u2019 s team was willing to go to ensure the deal \u2019 s success as it was still being negotiated .\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee \u2019 s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks , facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars .\n\u201c Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal , \u201d according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times . \u201c Despite these claims , the U.S. Department of the Treasury , at the direction of the U.S. State Department , granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system .\n\u201c Even after the specific license was issued , U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system , \u201d the report said .\nSen . Rob Portman , the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee , is set to outline his panel \u2019 s findings Wednesday .\nUnder terms of the nuclear deal , Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions , but it remained \u201c illegal for U.S. persons , entities , and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran . \u201d\nThe ban included any \u201c intermediary \u201d transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran \u2014 a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system .\nOn the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015 , Tehran had some $ 5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat , Oman , according to Senate investigators , who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar .\nOn Tehran \u2019 s request , Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department \u2019 s office of foreign assets control .\nAccording to the Senate report : \u201c Muscat sought to convert $ 5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros . [ But ] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar , the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars . \u201d\nObama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would \u201c continue to be denied access to the [ U.S. ] financial and commercial market \u201d under the proposed accord , but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran .\n\u201c On February 24 , 2016 , OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $ 5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system , \u201d according to the Senate report , which claims the move was made \u201c even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it . \u201d\nEven as office of foreign assets control officials directly \u201c encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds , \u201d the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction , said the report , which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , and Sen. Mark Kirk , Illinois Republican , that contended the Obama \u201c administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system . \u201d\nThe catch , according to Senate investigators , was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange \u2014 in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic .\nDespite the Obama administration \u2019 s efforts , Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system , the Senate investigators said .\nMr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that \u201c the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran . \u201d\n\u201c Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits , the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system , \u201d Mr. Portman said . \u201c The only reason this transaction wasn \u2019 t executed was because two U.S. banks refused , even though the administration asked them to help convert the money . \u201d\nSuch sanctions , he added , \u201c are a vital foreign policy tool , and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness . \u201d", "Washington ( CNN ) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday that the US is suspending the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , a key pact with Russia that has been a centerpiece of European security since the Cold War .\n`` For years , Russia has violated the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty without remorse , '' Pompeo said , speaking from the State Department . `` Russia 's violations put millions of Europeans and Americans at greater risk . ''\n`` It is our duty to respond appropriately , '' Pompeo said , adding that the US had provided `` ample time '' for Russia to return to compliance .\nThe long-expected suspension , which has raised concerns about a renewed arms race with Moscow and put European allies on edge , goes into effect on Saturday . Pompeo 's announcement starts a 180-day clock to complete withdrawal unless Russia returns to compliance with the 1987 agreement .\nPresident Donald Trump and his senior officials had been signaling for months that they were ready to pull out of the INF treaty , which the US accuses Moscow of violating since 2014 .\n`` The United States has fully adhered to the INF Treaty for more than 30 years , but we will not remain constrained by its terms while Russia misrepresents its actions , '' Trump said in a statement Friday . `` We can not be the only country in the world unilaterally bound by this treaty , or any other . ''\nLater , at the White House , the President hinted to reporters that he 'd be open to negotiations on a new treaty but did not mention Russia by name -- the only other signatory to the pact .\n`` I hope that you 're able to get everybody in a big and beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better , but certainly I would like to see that , '' Trump said , according to pool reports . `` But you have to have everybody adhere to it and you have a certain side that almost pretends it does n't exist . '\n`` So unless we 're going to have something we all agree to we ca n't be put at the disadvantage of going by a treaty , limiting what we do , when somebody else does n't go by that treaty , '' Trump said .\nWhile Russia and the US are the only two parties to the treaty , but it significantly affects European security .\nThe ground-based nuclear tipped cruise missiles covered by the bilateral agreement can fly between 310 to 3,100 miles , making them a threat to Europe , where officials have unanimously backed the US decision , even as they consider their next steps and admit having little to no optimism that the treaty can be saved .\nIn a statement , NATO said America 's allies `` fully support '' the US decision because of Russia 's threat to Euro-Atlantic security and its refusal to provide any credible response or take any steps towards full and verifiable compliance .\nNATO urged Russia to use the next six months to `` return to full and verifiable compliance to preserve the INF Treaty .

This is solely about Russia 's violation of this treaty .

The US position remains rather tough and ultimatum-like , '' Ryabkov said , according to Russian state media outlet TASS .\n`` We told the US side that it is impossible to hold dialogue in the conditions of attempted blackmailing of Russia , '' he added .\nSenior US administration officials countered Thursday by laying out Russia 's repeated efforts to get the US to agree to dissolve the treaty and years of American effort to get Russia to comply , including 35 diplomatic engagements ranging from the highest political levels to technical talks .\n`` We have , unfortunately , very little to show for it , '' said a US official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity , stressing that `` the onus is on Russia . ''\n`` Russia continues to deny its violations ... Russia will have this chance . If they are truly interested in preserving this treaty , this is their final chance , '' the official continued . `` It would be in Russia 's best interests to return to full and verifiable compliance . ''\nThis official noted the `` remarkable unity '' among the US and its European allies , but European officials say they 're concerned about the treaty dissolving and say they will use the six-month window to urge Russia to comply .\n`` It is clear to us that Russia has violated this treaty and that 's why we need to speak to Russia , '' German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a press conference in Berlin on Friday , shortly before the US announced its intention to suspend the treaty .\nGermany will `` do everything we can '' to use the six-month deadline after the termination to hold further talks with Russia , Merkel said .\nEuropean officials discussing the fallout in the coming months point to a possible increase in Russian cyber activities , including its influence campaigns , Russia is likely to use the US withdrawal as an excuse to deploy systems elsewhere and the certainty of finger-pointing , as Moscow works to assign blame .\n`` Russia will feel more legitimized to continue what it 's doing now , but also increasing some of its efforts on missile technology and deploying them , '' said a European official .\nA second European official said that `` they will threaten , they will try to divide NATO , they 'll do anything but stay quiet . '' The Russians will likely argue that `` this is about the US and the US trying to destabilize the international order , '' this official said , stressing that Europe has been united in its stance , alongside the US , that Russia has been violating the treaty .\n`` The bigger picture is what kind of sign you 're sending out , what message you 're sending , '' said a third European official . `` For us , this treaty was extremely important for our security .

The New York Times reported that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is looking into informant Stefan Halper \u2019 s work during the Russia probe , as well as his work with the FBI prior to the start of that probe .\nBARR REVEALS HE IS REVIEWING 'CONDUCT ' OF FBI 'S ORIGINAL RUSSIA PROBE\nHalper , an American professor who reportedly is deeply connected with British and American intelligence agencies , has been widely reported as a confidential source for the FBI during the bureau \u2019 s original investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election . That official counterintelligence operation was opened by then-senior agent Peter Strzok , who has since been fired from the bureau .\nDuring the 2016 campaign , Halper contacted several members of the Trump campaign , including former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former aide Carter Page . Page also was the subject of several Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrants during the campaign -- which is an issue at the heart of the IG 's investigation . Republicans , including President Trump , have alleged misconduct in the bureau and Justice Department \u2019 s handling of those FISA warrants .\n`` It was an illegal investigation . ... Everything about it was crooked , '' Trump told reporters on Wednesday , describing it as an attempted `` coup '' and reiterating his interest in digging into the probe 's origins . `` There is a hunger for that to happen . ''\nThe Times , in its report , noted that Halper also contacted former Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis . It is unclear whether Halper had the FBI \u2019 s permission to contact Clovis , according to the report .\nHorowitz , more broadly , is probing alleged wrongdoing related to the issuance of FISA warrants to surveil Page during the election . During a prior hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday , Barr testified that Horowitz \u2019 s investigation is expected to be complete by May or June .\nWhile vowing to release Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's now-completed Russia report in a matter of days , Barr also announced Tuesday that he was reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation at the FBI and the Justice Department , amid mounting calls for scrutiny of the probe 's beginnings from Trump and prominent congressional Republicans .\n\u201c More generally , I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted in the summer of 2016 , \u201d Barr told the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday .\nBARR ASSEMBLES 'TEAM ' TO LOOK INTO COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2016 , OFFICIAL SAYS\nAlso on Tuesday , Fox News reported that a source said Barr had assembled a \u201c team \u201d to investigate the origins of the bureau \u2019 s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign .\nOn Wednesday , Barr testified that he has n't technically `` set up a team '' but has colleagues helping him as he reviews the case .\n`` This is not launching an investigation of the FBI , '' he stressed . `` Frankly , to the extent there were issues at the FBI , I do not view it as a problem of the FBI . I think it was probably a failure of the group of leaders\u2014the upper echelons of the FBI . I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I am very pleased Director Chris Wray is there . ''\nHe added , `` If it becomes necessary to look over former officials , I expect to rely on Chris and work with him . I have an obligation to make sure government power is not abused and I think that \u2019 s one of the principal roles of the attorney general . ''\nThe FBI \u2019 s 2016 counterintelligence investigation , formally opened by Strzok , began with a \u201c paucity \u201d of evidence , according to former FBI counsel Lisa Page , with whom Strzok was romantically involved . During a closed-door congressional interview , Page admitted that the FBI \u201c knew so little \u201d about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were \u201c true or not true \u201d at the time they opened the probe , adding that they had just \u201c a paucity of evidence because we [ were ] just starting down the path \u201d of vetting allegations .\nPage also said in her interview that it was \u201c entirely common \u201d that the FBI would begin an investigation with just a \u201c small amount of evidence . \u201d\nBarr \u2019 s team will also review the FISA warrants issued against Carter Page . The issuance of the FISA warrants relied , in part , on the unverified anti-Trump dossier authored by ex-British Intelligence Agent Christopher Steele , who worked on behalf of Fusion GPS\u2014a firm paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie to do opposition research against the Trump campaign . In the dossier , Steele accused Page of conspiring with Russians . Page was not charged with any wrongdoing in either the FBI \u2019 s Russia probe or Mueller \u2019 s .\nFox News exclusively obtained internal FBI text messages last month showing that just nine days before the FBI applied for the Page FISA warrant , bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had `` continued concerns '' about the `` possible bias '' of a source pivotal to the application .\nBarr \u2019 s review could also dovetail with the work U.S. Attorney John Huber has been doing . In 2017 , former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed Huber to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI but also the handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation and other matters .\nThe day following Barr \u2019 s release of his summary of the Mueller report , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said his panel also would investigate alleged FISA abuses at the start of the Russia investigation and called on Barr to appoint a new special counsel to investigate \u201c the other side of the story. \u201d Graham has been calling for a second special counsel since 2017 to investigate \u201c whether or not a counterintelligence investigation was opened as a back door to spy on the Trump campaign . \u201d\nAlso , House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , said over the weekend he was preparing to send eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department this week regarding alleged misconduct by DOJ and FBI officials during the Trump-Russia investigation . It is unclear whom Nunes will refer for investigation , and what the process at the Justice Department might be .\nWhen asked Tuesday about Nunes \u2019 referrals , Barr said he hasn \u2019 t seen them yet , but , \u201c Obviously , if there is a predicate for investigation , it will be conducted . \u201d", "The White House has assailed President Donald Trump 's critics after he was cleared of Russian election collusion .\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders told cable morning shows that Mr Trump is happy for the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller to be released .\nShe said the summary of the findings issued by the attorney general amounted to a full vindication of the president .\nMr Mueller 's long-awaited report , however , stops short of exonerating Mr Trump of obstruction of justice .\nIt was the culmination of a nearly two-year investigation that saw some of the president 's closest former aides prosecuted and , in some cases , imprisoned , though not for collusion with Russia .\nWhite House aides took to the airwaves on Monday to depict the president as the victim of an inquiry that should never have been allowed .\nWhen asked whether Mr Trump would support the release of the full report , Mrs Sanders told NBC News ' Today programme : `` He 's more than happy for any of this stuff to come out . ''\nSpeaking on CNN later on Monday , Mrs Sanders said it was `` outrageous '' that Democrats and journalists had spent two years portraying the president as an agent of a foreign power .\n`` That 's equivalent to treason , '' said the press secretary . `` That 's punishable by death in this country and that is outrageous . ''\nMrs Sanders said the `` obscene lie '' was used to try `` to overthrow the president of the United States '' .\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Monday called on Democrat Adam Schiff , Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , to step down .\n`` He ought to resign today , '' she told Fox News . `` He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would be impeached or indicted . ''\n`` It was a complete and total exoneration , '' Mr Trump declared on Sunday , even though the report specifically states that he has not been fully exonerated .\nSpeaking at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida , he said : `` It 's a shame that our country had to go through this .\n`` To be honest , it 's a shame that your president has had to go through this . Before I even got elected it began and it began illegally . ''\nThe Republican president said the inquiry was an `` illegal takedown that failed '' .\nIn his four-page summary released on Sunday , Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr wrote : `` The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia . ''\nBut on the issue of whether justice was obstructed , Mr Mueller 's report says : `` While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime , it also does not exonerate him . ''\nThese include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses , and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee .\nCongress is also continuing its own inquiries , mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives .\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham summed up the conservative response on Monday , telling reporters Mr Trump was stronger today than ever .\n`` This cloud has been removed , '' he said . `` To those wanting an outcome of removing Trump , you 're going to be disappointed . ''\nOpposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller 's report .\nThe Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee , Jerry Nadler , said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee `` in the near future '' over `` very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department '' .\nRussia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result .\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked suggestions there had been collusion , saying : `` I recall the words of the Chinese philosopher who said that it 's hard to find a black cat in a dark room , especially if it 's not there . Well , centuries pass and unfortunately they still do n't understand that across the ocean . ''\nAlexei Pushkov , a member of Russia 's upper house , tweeted : `` Democrats , Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy which existed only in their heads and in headlines , and nowhere else . ''\nLegally , the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report . They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he could n't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice .\nAnd remember , obstruction of justice is one of the `` high crimes and misdemeanours '' that can lead to impeachment .\nThere will be an endless back and forth over that . And I would n't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly .\nCommittees have the right to call people and papers . They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can . They want to play this long . They want to damage the president .\nTo prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct . So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation , if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law , then he 's done nothing wrong legally .", "Michael Zeldin , a CNN legal analyst , served as deputy independent counsel , and later as independent counsel , in the investigation into allegations that the administration of George H. W. Bush violated the privacy rights of candidate Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential campaign . He also served as a special counsel to Robert Mueller in the Department of Justice .

'' The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors ; view more opinion articles on CNN .\n( CNN ) At the end of independent counsel Ken Starr 's investigation of Bill Clinton , Starr submitted directly to Congress his final report , which included 11 specific bases for possible impeachment .\nGiven the numerous obstruction of justice findings in part two of special counsel Robert Mueller 's report , many ca n't understand why Mueller did n't do the same .\nUnder the independent counsel law that was in effect at the time of Starr 's report , the independent counsel was required to advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible evidence that may constitute grounds for an impeachment .\nIn reaction to what some perceived as Starr 's `` salacious '' public report , however , in 1999 , Congress allowed the independent counsel law to lapse . In its place , the Department of Justice issued the special counsel regulations . These regulations , which remain in effect today , do not permit a special counsel to submit a report to Congress . They only permit a special counsel to submit a confidential report to the Attorney General .\nWe believe , and Michael Zeldin has written , that this constraint on Mueller ( and other limitations in the regulations ) make it imperative for Congress to consider resurrecting the independent counsel statute or a similar law .\nJUST WATCHED Former Whitewater Independent Counsel defends AG Barr amid criticism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former Whitewater Independent Counsel defends AG Barr amid criticism 04:27\nIt would take time to pass any new legislation , however , and that would only affect future investigations . But meanwhile , Congress is struggling to figure out what to do with Mueller 's findings . Our view is that it would be sensible for Congress to consider analyzing the Mueller report 's obstruction findings under the same standard as that of independent counsels -- by asking whether Mueller would have been obligated to advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible evidence that may constitute grounds for an impeachment .\nThis would give Congress , in its oversight capacity , a workable framework for analyzing whether they believe that an impeachment inquiry is warranted .\nIn the interest of time and to cut to the heart of the matter , Congress should primarily focus on the three key areas Mueller identified as most legally problematic . Specifically , Trump 's efforts to remove Mueller as special counsel and create a false narrative of those efforts ; Trump 's efforts to put an end to the Russia investigation ; and Trump 's firing of FBI director James Comey . ( Other acts -- for example , those relating to the investigation of Michael Flynn -- could be considered , too , if warranted by the initial inquiry . )\nIn each of these areas , Mueller found that all of the statutory requirements for an obstruction of justice prosecution were met . In each case , he found an obstructive act , a nexus to an official proceeding , and corrupt intent .\nIn his report , Mueller set forth substantial direct and corroborative evidence of obstructive conduct for each inquiry . And , as to each , Mueller refuted the constitutional and statutory defenses he anticipated would be made if charges were brought against the President .\nCongress , of course , will need to make its own determination , as impeachment is a political judgment informed by , but not dependent on , violations of statutory law .\nTo do this , each member of Congress will need to read the full Mueller report . In addition , Congress will need to be able to obtain all the evidence underlying the Mueller report ( as was done in the Starr investigation ) that pertains to the issues under review , compel the testimony of relevant witnesses ( so that Congress and the American people can assess their credibility ) , and hear from lawyers ( including Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein ) , constitutional scholars , and historians to obtain insight into whether the specific acts of alleged obstruction as well as the overall pattern of behavior that Mueller describes meets the Constitutional threshold of `` high crimes and misdemeanors .

A personality psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development , Rohrer is trying to get her peers to publicly , willingly admit it when they are wrong .\nTo do this , she , along with some colleagues , started up something called the Loss of Confidence Project . It \u2019 s designed to be an academic safe space for researchers to declare for all to see that they no longer believe in the accuracy of one of their previous findings . The effort recently yielded a paper that includes six admissions of no confidence . And it \u2019 s accepting submissions until January 31 .\n\u201c I do think it \u2019 s a cultural issue that people are not willing to admit mistakes , \u201d Rohrer says . \u201c Our broader goal is to gently nudge the whole scientific system and psychology toward a different culture , \u201d where it \u2019 s okay , normalized , and expected for researchers to admit past mistakes and not get penalized for it .\nThe project is timely because a large number of scientific findings have been disproven , or become more doubtful , in recent years . One high-profile effort to retest 100 psychological experiments found only 40 percent replicated with more rigorous methods . It \u2019 s been a painful period for social scientists , who \u2019 ve had to deal with failed replications of classic studies and realize their research practices are often weak .\n\u201c Not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition \u201d\nIt \u2019 s been fascinating to watch scientists struggle to make their institutions more humble . And I believe there \u2019 s an important and underappreciated virtue embedded in this process .\nFor the past few months , I \u2019 ve been talking to many scholars about intellectual humility , the characteristic that allows for admission of wrongness .\nI \u2019 ve come to appreciate what a crucial tool it is for learning , especially in an increasingly interconnected and complicated world . As technology makes it easier to lie and spread false information incredibly quickly , we need intellectually humble , curious people .\nI \u2019 ve also realized how difficult it is to foster intellectual humility . In my reporting on this , I \u2019 ve learned there are three main challenges on the path to humility :\nIn order for us to acquire more intellectual humility , we all , even the smartest among us , need to better appreciate our cognitive blind spots . Our minds are more imperfect and imprecise than we \u2019 d often like to admit . Our ignorance can be invisible . Even when we overcome that immense challenge and figure out our errors , we need to remember we won \u2019 t necessarily be punished for saying , \u201c I was wrong. \u201d And we need to be braver about saying it . We need a culture that celebrates those words . We \u2019 ll never achieve perfect intellectual humility . So we need to choose our convictions thoughtfully .\nThis is all to say : Intellectual humility isn \u2019 t easy . But damn , it \u2019 s a virtue worth striving for , and failing for , in this new year .\nIntellectual humility is simply \u201c the recognition that the things you believe in might in fact be wrong , \u201d as Mark Leary , a social and personality psychologist at Duke University , tells me .\nBut don \u2019 t confuse it with overall humility or bashfulness . It \u2019 s not about being a pushover ; it \u2019 s not about lacking confidence , or self-esteem . The intellectually humble don \u2019 t cave every time their thoughts are challenged .\nInstead , it \u2019 s a method of thinking . It \u2019 s about entertaining the possibility that you may be wrong and being open to learning from the experience of others . Intellectual humility is about being actively curious about your blind spots . One illustration is in the ideal of the scientific method , where a scientist actively works against her own hypothesis , attempting to rule out any other alternative explanations for a phenomenon before settling on a conclusion . It \u2019 s about asking : What am I missing here ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t require a high IQ or a particular skill set . It does , however , require making a habit of thinking about your limits , which can be painful . \u201c It \u2019 s a process of monitoring your own confidence , \u201d Leary says .\nWhen I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance , I can \u2019 t help but feel a sudden suffocating feeling\nThis idea is older than social psychology . Philosophers from the earliest days have grappled with the limits of human knowledge . Michel de Montaigne , the 16th-century French philosopher credited with inventing the essay , wrote that \u201c the plague of man is boasting of his knowledge . \u201d\nSocial psychologists have learned that humility is associated with other valuable character traits : People who score higher on intellectual humility questionnaires are more open to hearing opposing views . They more readily seek out information that conflicts with their worldview . They pay more attention to evidence and have a stronger self-awareness when they answer a question incorrectly .\nWhen you ask the intellectually arrogant if they \u2019 ve heard of bogus historical events like \u201c Hamrick \u2019 s Rebellion , \u201d they \u2019 ll say , \u201c Sure. \u201d The intellectually humble are less likely to do so . Studies have found that cognitive reflection \u2014 i.e. , analytic thinking \u2014 is correlated with being better able to discern fake news stories from real ones . These studies haven \u2019 t looked at intellectual humility per se , but it \u2019 s plausible there \u2019 s an overlap .\nMost important of all , the intellectually humble are more likely to admit it when they are wrong . When we admit we \u2019 re wrong , we can grow closer to the truth .\nOne reason I \u2019 ve been thinking about the virtue of humility recently is because our president , Donald Trump , is one of the least humble people on the planet .\nIt was Trump who said on the night of his nomination , \u201c I alone can fix it , \u201d with the \u201c it \u201d being our entire political system . It was Trump who once said , \u201c I have one of the great memories of all time. \u201d More recently , Trump told the Associated Press , \u201c I have a natural instinct for science , \u201d in dodging a question on climate change .\nA frustration I feel about Trump and the era of history he represents is that his pride and his success \u2014 he is among the most powerful people on earth \u2014 seem to be related . He exemplifies how our society rewards confidence and bluster , not truthfulness .\nYet we \u2019 ve also seen some very high-profile examples lately of how overconfident leadership can be ruinous for companies . Look at what happened to Theranos , a company that promised to change the way blood samples are drawn . It was all hype , all bluster , and it collapsed . Or consider Enron \u2019 s overconfident executives , who were often hailed for their intellectual brilliance \u2014 they ran the company into the ground with risky , suspect financial decisions .\nThe problem with arrogance is that the truth always catches up . Trump may be president and confident in his denials of climate change , but the changes to our environment will still ruin so many things in the future .\nWhy it \u2019 s so hard to see our blind spots : \u201c Our ignorance is invisible to us \u201d\nAs I \u2019 ve been reading the psychological research on intellectual humility and the character traits it correlates with , I can \u2019 t help but fume : Why can \u2019 t more people be like this ?\nWe need more intellectual humility for two reasons . One is that our culture promotes and rewards overconfidence and arrogance ( think Trump and Theranos , or the advice your career counselor gave you when going into job interviews ) . At the same time , when we are wrong \u2014 out of ignorance or error \u2014 and realize it , our culture doesn \u2019 t make it easy to admit it . Humbling moments too easily can turn into moments of humiliation .\nSo how can we promote intellectual humility for both of these conditions ?\nIn asking that question of researchers and scholars , I \u2019 ve learned to appreciate how hard a challenge it is to foster intellectual humility .\nFirst off , I think it \u2019 s helpful to remember how flawed the human brain can be and how prone we all are to intellectual blind spots . When you learn about how the brain actually works , how it actually perceives the world , it \u2019 s hard not to be a bit horrified , and a bit humbled .\nWe often can \u2019 t see \u2014 or even sense \u2014 what we don \u2019 t know . It helps to realize that it \u2019 s normal and human to be wrong .\nIt \u2019 s rare that a viral meme also provides a surprisingly deep lesson on the imperfect nature of the human mind . But believe it or not , the great \u201c Yanny or Laurel \u201d debate of 2018 fits the bill .\nFor the very few of you who didn \u2019 t catch it \u2014 I hope you \u2019 re recovering nicely from that coma \u2014 here \u2019 s what happened .\nAn audio clip ( you can hear it below ) says the name \u201c Laurel \u201d in a robotic voice . Or does it ? Some people hear the clip and immediately hear \u201c Yanny. \u201d And both sets of people \u2014 Team Yanny and Team Laurel \u2014 are indeed hearing the same thing .\nWhat do you hear ? ! Yanny or Laurel pic.twitter.com/jvHhCbMc8I \u2014 Cloe Feldman ( @ CloeCouture ) May 15 , 2018\nHearing , the perception of sound , ought to be a simple thing for our brains to do . That so many people can listen to the same clip and hear such different things should give us humbling pause . Hearing \u201c Yanny \u201d or \u201c Laurel \u201d in any given moment ultimately depends on a whole host of factors : the quality of the speakers you \u2019 re using , whether you have hearing loss , your expectations .\nHere \u2019 s the deep lesson to draw from all of this : Much as we might tell ourselves our experience of the world is the truth , our reality will always be an interpretation . Light enters our eyes , sound waves enter our ears , chemicals waft into our noses , and it \u2019 s up to our brains to make a guess about what it all is .\n\u201c The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don \u2019 t know you \u2019 re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club \u201d\nPerceptual tricks like this ( \u201c the dress \u201d is another one ) reveal that our perceptions are not the absolute truth , that the physical phenomena of the universe are indifferent to whether our feeble sensory organs can perceive them correctly . We \u2019 re just guessing . Yet these phenomena leave us indignant : How could it be that our perception of the world isn \u2019 t the only one ?\nThat sense of indignation is called naive realism : the feeling that our perception of the world is the truth . \u201c I think we sometimes confuse effortlessness with accuracy , \u201d Chris Chabris , a psychological researcher who co-authored a book on the challenges of human perception , tells me . When something is so immediate and effortless to us \u2014 hearing the sound of \u201c Yanny \u201d \u2014 it just feels true . ( Similarly , psychologists find when a lie is repeated , it \u2019 s more likely to be misremembered as being true , and for a similar reason : When you \u2019 re hearing something for the second or third time , your brain becomes faster to respond to it . And that fluency is confused with truth . )\nOur interpretations of reality are often arbitrary , but we \u2019 re still stubborn about them . Nonetheless , the same observations can lead to wildly different conclusions .\nDifferent scientific models can have equivalent observational consequences . In # statistics , this is known as statistical equivalence ; in the philosophy of science , underdetermination of theory by # data . This GIF is a really good ( and beautiful ) # dataviz.https : //t.co/7P8wjdAjgO pic.twitter.com/eLTREWzh7F \u2014 Talia Bronshtein ( @ ininteraction ) December 7 , 2018\nFor every sense and every component of human judgment , there are illusions and ambiguities we interpret arbitrarily .\nSome are gravely serious . White people often perceive black men to be bigger , taller , and more muscular ( and therefore more threatening ) than they really are . That \u2019 s racial bias \u2014 but it \u2019 s also a socially constructed illusion . When we \u2019 re taught or learn to fear other people , our brains distort their potential threat . They seem more menacing , and we want to build walls around them . When we learn or are taught that other people are less than human , we \u2019 re less likely to look upon them kindly and more likely to be okay when violence is committed against them .\nNot only are our interpretations of the world often arbitrary , but we \u2019 re often overconfident in them . \u201c Our ignorance is invisible to us , \u201d David Dunning , an expert on human blind spots , says .\nYou might recognize his name as half of the psychological phenomenon that bears his name : the Dunning-Kruger effect . That \u2019 s where people of low ability \u2014 let \u2019 s say , those who fail to understand logic puzzles \u2014 tend to unduly overestimate their abilities . Inexperience masquerades as expertise .\nAn irony of the Dunning-Kruger effect is that so many people misinterpret it , are overconfident in their understanding of it , and get it wrong .\nWhen people talk or write about the Dunning-Kruger effect , it \u2019 s almost always in reference to other people . \u201c The fact is this is a phenomenon that visits all of us sooner or later , \u201d Dunning says . We \u2019 re all overconfident in our ignorance from time to time . ( Perhaps related : Some 65 percent of Americans believe they \u2019 re more intelligent than average , which is wishful thinking . )\nSimilarly , we \u2019 re overconfident in our ability to remember . Human memory is extremely malleable , prone to small changes . When we remember , we don \u2019 t wind back our minds to a certain time and relive that exact moment , yet many of us think our memories work like a videotape .\nDunning hopes his work helps people understand that \u201c not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition , \u201d he says . \u201c But the problem with it is we see it in other people , and we don \u2019 t see it in ourselves . The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don \u2019 t know you \u2019 re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club . \u201d\nPeople are unlikely to judge you harshly for admitting you \u2019 re wrong\nIn 2012 , psychologist Will Gervais scored an honor any PhD science student would covet : a co-authored paper in the journal Science , one of the top interdisciplinary scientific journals in the world . Publishing in Science doesn \u2019 t just help a researcher rise up in academic circles ; it often gets them a lot of media attention too .\nOne of the experiments in the paper tried to see if getting people to think more rationally would make them less willing to report religious beliefs . They had people look at a picture of Rodin \u2019 s The Thinker or another statue . They thought The Thinker would nudge people to think harder , more analytically . In this more rational frame of mind , then , the participants would be less likely to endorse believing in something as faith-based and invisible as religion , and that \u2019 s what the study found . It was catnip for science journalists : one small trick to change the way we think .\n\u201c How would I know if I was wrong ? \u201d is actually a really , really hard question to answer\nBut it was a tiny , small-sample study , the exact type that is prone to yielding false positives . Several years later , another lab attempted to replicate the findings with a much larger sample size , and failed to find any evidence for the effect .\nAnd while Gervais knew that the original study wasn \u2019 t rigorous , he couldn \u2019 t help but feel a twinge of discomfort .\n\u201c Intellectually , I could say the original data weren \u2019 t strong , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s very different from the human , personal reaction to it . Which is like , \u2018 Oh , shit , there \u2019 s going to be a published failure to replicate my most cited finding that \u2019 s gotten the most media attention. \u2019 You start worrying about stuff like , \u2018 Are there going to be career repercussions ? Are people going to think less of my other work and stuff I \u2019 ve done ? \u2019 \u201d\nGervais \u2019 s story is familiar : Many of us fear we \u2019 ll be seen as less competent , less trustworthy , if we admit wrongness . Even when we can see our own errors \u2014 which , as outlined above , is not easy to do \u2014 we \u2019 re hesitant to admit it .\nBut turns out this assumption is false . As Adam Fetterman , a social psychologist at the University of Texas El Paso , has found in a few studies , wrongness admission isn \u2019 t usually judged harshly . \u201c When we do see someone admit that they are wrong , the wrongness admitter is seen as more communal , more friendly , \u201d he says . It \u2019 s almost never the case , in his studies , \u201c that when you admit you \u2019 re wrong , people think you are less competent . \u201d\nSure , there might be some people who will troll you for your mistakes . There might be a mob on Twitter that converges in order to shame you . Some moments of humility could be humiliating . But this fear must be vanquished if we are to become less intellectually arrogant and more intellectually humble .\nHumility can \u2019 t just come from within \u2014 we need environments where it can thrive\nBut even if you \u2019 re motivated to be more intellectually humble , our culture doesn \u2019 t always reward it .\nThe field of psychology , overall , has been reckoning with a \u201c replication crisis \u201d where many classic findings in the science don \u2019 t hold up under rigorous scrutiny . Incredibly influential textbook findings in psychology \u2014 like the \u201c ego depletion \u201d theory of willpower or the \u201c marshmallow test \u201d \u2014 have been bending or breaking .\nI \u2019 ve found it fascinating to watch the field of psychology deal with this . For some researchers , the reckoning has been personally unsettling . \u201c I \u2019 m in a dark place , \u201d Michael Inzlicht , a University of Toronto psychologist , wrote in a 2016 blog post after seeing the theory of ego depletion crumble before his eyes . \u201c Have I been chasing puffs of smoke for all these years ? \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik \u2019 s cube : a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk \u201d\nWhat I \u2019 ve learned from reporting on the \u201c replication crisis \u201d is that intellectual humility requires support from peers and institutions . And that environment is hard to build .\n\u201c What we teach undergrads is that scientists want to prove themselves wrong , \u201d says Simine Vazire , a psychologist and journal editor who often writes and speaks about replication issues . \u201c But , \u2018 How would I know if I was wrong ? \u2019 is actually a really , really hard question to answer . It involves things like having critics yell at you and telling you that you did things wrong and reanalyze your data . \u201d\nAnd that \u2019 s not fun . Again : Even among scientists \u2014 people who ought to question everything \u2014 intellectual humility is hard . In some cases , researchers have refused to concede their original conclusions despite the unveiling of new evidence . ( One famous psychologist under fire recently told me angrily , \u201c I will stand by that conclusion for the rest of my life , no matter what anyone says . \u201d )\nPsychologists are human . When they reach a conclusion , it becomes hard to see things another way . Plus , the incentives for a successful career in science push researchers to publish as many positive findings as possible .\nThere are two solutions \u2014 among many \u2014 to make psychological science more humble , and I think we can learn from them .\nOne is that humility needs to be built into the standard practices of the science . And that happens through transparency . It \u2019 s becoming more commonplace for scientists to preregister \u2014 i.e. , commit to \u2014 a study design before even embarking on an experiment . That way , it \u2019 s harder for them to deviate from the plan and cherry-pick results . It also makes sure all data is open and accessible to anyone who wants to conduct a reanalysis .\nThat \u201c sort of builds humility into the structure of the scientific enterprise , \u201d Chabris says . \u201c We \u2019 re not all-knowing and all-seeing and perfect at our jobs , so we put [ the data ] out there for other people to check out , to improve upon it , come up with new ideas from and so on. \u201d To be more intellectually humble , we need to be more transparent about our knowledge . We need to show others what we know and what we don \u2019 t .\nAnd two , there needs to be more celebration of failure , and a culture that accepts it . That includes building safe places for people to admit they were wrong , like the Loss of Confidence Project .\n\u201c In the end , \u201d Rohrer says , after getting a lot of positive feedback on the project , \u201c we ended up with just a handful of statements . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a personal cost to an intellectually humble outlook . For me , at least , it \u2019 s anxiety .\nWhen I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance , I can \u2019 t help but feel a sudden suffocating feeling . I have just one small mind , a tiny , leaky boat upon which to go exploring knowledge in a vast and knotty sea of which I carry no clear map .\nWhy is it that some people never seem to wrestle with those waters ? That they stand on the shore , squint their eyes , and transform that sea into a puddle in their minds and then get awarded for their false certainty ? \u201c I don \u2019 t know if I can tell you that humility will get you farther than arrogance , \u201d says Tenelle Porter , a University of California Davis psychologist who has studied intellectual humility .\nOf course , following humility to an extreme end isn \u2019 t enough . You don \u2019 t need to be humble about your belief that the world is round . I just think more humility , sprinkled here and there , would be quite nice .\n\u201c It \u2019 s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik \u2019 s cube : a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk , \u201d says Michael Lynch , a University of Connecticut philosophy professor . Instead , it \u2019 s a problem \u201c you can make progress at a moment in time , and make things better . And that we can do \u2014 that we can definitely do . \u201d\nFor a democracy to flourish , Lynch argues , we need a balance between convictions \u2014 our firmly held beliefs \u2014 and humility . We need convictions , because \u201c an apathetic electorate is no electorate at all , \u201d he says . And we need humility because we need to listen to one another . Those two things will always be in tension .\nThe Trump presidency suggests there \u2019 s too much conviction and not enough humility in our current culture .\n\u201c The personal question , the existential question that faces you and I and every thinking human being , is , \u2018 How do you maintain an open mind toward others and yet , at the same time , keep your strong moral convictions ? \u2019 \u201d Lynch says . \u201c That \u2019 s an issue for all of us . \u201d\nTo be intellectually humble doesn \u2019 t mean giving up on the ideas we love and believe in . It just means we need to be thoughtful in choosing our convictions , be open to adjusting them , seek out their flaws , and never stop being curious about why we believe what we believe . Again , that \u2019 s not easy .\nYou might be thinking : \u201c All the social science cited here about how intellectual humility is correlated with open-minded thinking \u2014 what if that \u2019 s all bunk ? \u201d To that , I \u2019 d say the research isn \u2019 t perfect . Those studies are based on self-reports , where it can be hard to trust that people really do know themselves or that they \u2019 re being totally honest . And we know that social science findings are often upended .\nBut I \u2019 m going to take it as a point of conviction that intellectual humility is a virtue . I \u2019 ll draw that line for myself . It \u2019 s my conviction .\nCould I be wrong ? Maybe . Just try to convince me otherwise .", "Ready for Thanksgiving ? Before you eat that turkey , I hope you think about why America has turkeys for you to eat . Most people do n't know .\nEveryone 's heard about that first Thanksgiving feast -- Pilgrims and Indians sharing the harvest . We like the drawings of it we saw in schoolbooks -- shared bounty .\nFewer people know that before that first feast , the Pilgrims nearly starved .\nThey almost starved because they acted the way some Bernie Sanders fans want people to act . They farmed collectively .\nBut communal farming creates what economists call `` the tragedy of the commons . ''\nThink about what happens if a bunch of ranchers hold land in common . Everyone brings cattle to graze . While that sounds nice , it also means every rancher has an incentive to bring lots of cattle to the pasture . They bring cow after cow until the pasture is overgrazed -- destroyed .\nFor this week 's YouTube video , I repeated an experiment economics teachers sometimes do to demonstrate the tragedy of the commons .\nI assembled a group of people , put coins on the floor in front of them and said , `` I 'll give you a dollar for each coin you pick up . But if you leave them down there for a minute , I 'll give you two bucks per coin , and then three bucks . Each minute the coins increase in value by a dollar . ''\nAs soon as I said `` Go ! '' everyone frantically grabbed for coins . No one wanted to wait because someone else would have gotten the money .\nCollective action makes people more greedy and short-sighted , not less .\nThen I changed the rules of the game . I divided the floor into segments , so each person had his or her own property . Then we played the game again .\nThis time there was no coin-grabbing frenzy . Now patient people anticipated the future .\n`` I want to reap the most benefit , '' said one . `` ( On the previous test ) I wanted it now , whereas this is going up , and it 's mine . ''\nExactly . When you own property , you want to preserve it , to allow it to keep producing good things .\nThat beneficial pattern disappears under collectivism , even if the collectivists are nice people . The Pilgrims started out sharing their land . When crops were ready to harvest , they behaved like the people in my experiment .\nSome Pilgrims sneaked out at night and grabbed extra food . Some picked corn before it was fully ready . The result ?\n`` By the spring , '' Pilgrim leader William Bradford wrote in his diary , `` our food stores were used up and people grew weak and thin . Some swelled with hunger . ''\nAdding to the problem , when people share the results of your work , some do n't work hard . The chance to take advantage of others ' joint labor is too tempting . Teenage Pilgrims were especially likely to steal the commune 's crops .\nHad the Pilgrims continued communal farming , this Thursday might be known as `` Starvation Day '' instead of Thanksgiving .\nFortunately , the Pilgrims were led not by Bernie Sanders fans or other commons-loving socialists , but by Governor Bradford , who wrote that he `` began to think how they might raise as much corn as they could ... that they might not still thus languish in misery ... After much debate ( I ) assigned each family a parcel of land ... ( T ) his had very good success , because it made every hand industrious . ''\nThere 's nothing like private ownership to make `` every hand industrious . ''\nThe Pilgrims never returned to shared planting . Owning plots of land allowed them to prosper and have feasts like the ones we 'll have Thursday .\nPrivate property became the foundation for building the most prosperous nation in the history of the world , a place where people have individual rights instead of group plans forced on everyone .\nWhen an entire economy is based on collectivism , like the Soviet Union was , it eventually collapses from inefficiency and misuse of resources .\nSo this Thanksgiving , thank private property . Every day , it protects us from the tragedy of the commons .", "Washington ( CNN ) House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi projected a message of unity Thursday evening at the outset of the congressional baseball game .\nThe joint interview , a first for the two , with CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` Erin Burnett OutFront , '' came a day after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others were shot at a Republican baseball practice .\n`` He 's got a ways to go , '' Ryan said of Scalise . `` He 's going to recover . It 's going to take him some time . ''\nPelosi , who like Ryan was wearing Louisiana gear in honor of Scalise , said the injured member was a `` lovely person , '' and hailed the bipartisan spirit of the annual game .\nAsked if the political climate and incidents like Wednesday 's shooting indicated an increased threat to lawmakers , Ryan said it was incumbent on politicians to cool things down across the nation .\nRyan said , `` What we 're trying to do is tone down the rhetoric , lead by example and show people we can disagree with one another , we can have different ideas without being vitriolic , without going to such extremes . ''\nHe added that members of Congress had to meet with the public and needed to strike a balance between `` openness and security . ''\nPelosi noted that in the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , several of her constituents were also shot -- including a nine-year-old girl who died .\n`` When we evaluate the needs of our members it 's about protecting the members and their constituents as well , '' Pelosi said .\nBoth stressed repeatedly the need for politicians to step away from inflammatory remarks .\nAs for the prospect of passing legislation on a bipartisan basis that could prevent gun violence incidents like Wednesday 's shooting , Ryan pointed to existing mental health legislation .\n`` We 've made some pretty good progress on that , '' Ryan said . `` We now have to execute and implement that progress . ''\nPelosi said there is desire among Democrats for a task force on gun safety to study the issue .\n`` But that 's not for today , '' Pelosi said . `` Today is about coming together and celebrating the greatness of Steve Scalise . ''\nRyan and Pelosi have sought to present a unified front since the shooting . Shortly after the incident , the pair addressed a packed House chamber , calling for unity and condemning the attack .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Pelosi and Ryan 's calls for unity .\n`` We want everybody to know that we 've always had a robust discussion of the issues in this country throughout our history , '' McConnell told CNN 's Anderson Cooper on Thursday in a joint interview with Schumer . `` But we do n't dislike each other . We work together all the time . ... We have our political arguments but at the end of the day , we are all Americans . And I think everybody needs to remember that because we 're all in this thing together . ''\nSchumer said he hopes the tragedy can bring the parties even `` closer together . ''\n`` We work together pretty closely before this tragedy , '' he said . `` But if it can help bring things closer together and help us all work closer together , it 's a horrible way to do it . We all pray for Mr. Scalise and all the other people 's speedy recovery , but let 's hope we can get some good at this tragedy. ``\nBoth agreed that arguments between Republicans and Democrats often make the news , but cooperation between the two parties does n't .\n`` If we can still , despite the rhetoric , work together in areas where we can work together and the Senate as the cooling saucer help and bring people together a little bit , that 's a very good thing and I know Mitch does because we 've talked about it , and I do -- we aim to do it , '' Schumer said .\nBut as several voices supportive of President Donald Trump , like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , drew lines between anti-Trump rhetoric and the shooting , Pelosi pushed back earlier Thursday , arguing the Republican insistence that Democratic rhetoric was to blame for the shooting rang hollow , given the long record of `` vitriolic '' language from the Republican side of the aisle .\nThe alleged gunman expressed intense opposition to Republicans on social media and identified himself as a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders .\nSanders took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to say the gunman had `` apparently volunteered '' for his campaign . He said the shooting `` sickened '' him and stressed his commitment to nonviolent action .\nIn the Thursday interview , Ryan said he wanted to find more opportunities for Republicans and Democrats to `` break bread '' together .", "Are people who disagree with us necessarily evil ? Of course not . While advocating , defending , or fighting for our own principles and positions , harboring feelings of animosity toward our opponents is a poison that can rob us of our happiness and health .\nWhen I was in law school at Michigan nearly half a century ago , my criminal law professor shared a statement that I \u2019 ve never forgotten . He said that a clever person focuses on how he is different from others , while a wise person focuses on what he has in common with others . ( Thank you , professor Kamisar . )\nRecently , I found a point of agreement with a hardcore socialist . While doing some research about the allegations of sexual assault leveled against Virginia \u2019 s Lt. Gov . Justin Fairfax , I came across an article from the World Socialist Web Site . The author , Barry Grey , made two points that agreed with my conservative values : 1 ) Fairfax should not be denied due process of law ; and 2 ) we can \u2019 t automatically accept as true every allegation of sexual assault . ( Anyone familiar with the 1955 torture-murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till , whose female accuser recanted years later , would resist the siren call to \u201c always believe women . \u201d )\nI disagree with Grey \u2019 s overall politics . In his article , he laments the removal of Al Franken from the Senate \u201c after he was accused of minor sexual improprieties. \u201d His reason : Franken \u2019 s resignation shifted the balance of the Senate slightly toward the conservative side , rendering \u201c abortion rights \u201d less secure . Aha , I thought . Would Grey have defended pro-life Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s right to due process last fall during Justice Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation hearings ?\nI went first to the Socialist Worker website , where I found a collection of opinions from eight of its contributors . Every single one of them called for Kavanaugh \u2019 s scalp , due process be damned . But when I tracked down Grey \u2019 s Oct. 4 commentary on the Kavanaugh hearings , he unflinchingly rebuked the Democratic lynch mob for rejecting \u201c the presumption of innocence \u201d and for showing \u201c contempt for basic democratic rights , including due process. \u201d Bravo ! While I remain miles apart from Grey \u2019 s political goals , I commend him for his integrity and courage in adhering faithfully to crucial principles of justice .\nThere is another recent issue where I find myself in agreement with a large number of people on the left . When Amazon announced that it was abandoning its plan to expand its headquarters into Queens , New York , the left exulted for a variety of reasons , most of them nonsensical and riddled with standard class-warfare boilerplate . Typical of the latter , Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) effusively wrote on Twitter , \u201c Today was the day a group of dedicated , everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon \u2019 s corporate greed , its worker exploitation , and the power of the richest man in the world . \u201d\nWhat actually happened was that Amazon decided to walk away from nearly $ 3 billion in tax breaks because of the financial beating they were facing from a cabal of NYC unions and politicians . Whatever \u201c greed \u201d Amazon was guilty of was exceeded by the unions \u2019 greed . The scheme that had been hatched in the cesspool of Big Apple politics was that Amazon would be lured by tax breaks , and then the unions would latch onto Amazon and leech billions away from it . Amazon was being wooed as the patsy , or the conduit , through which the $ 3 billion of tax breaks\u2014tax breaks that would have to be covered by the rest of the local taxpayers\u2014would pass through Amazon and end up in the pockets of unions and other political insiders .\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez called \u201c the power of the richest man in the world \u201d ( Jeff Bezos ) was no match for the power of the NYC political machine . That \u2019 s why Bezos wisely bailed out before his company could be fleeced . That prudent decision is a shame for the thousands of New Yorkers who would love to have been \u201c exploited \u201d ( Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s characterization ) by one of the many six-figure jobs that Amazon would have created in Queens .\nAll that having been said , I join with the progressives in celebrating that NYC \u2019 s taxpayers will no longer have to be stuck paying for a $ 3 billion subsidy to a private business . There is no principle of justice that justifies such a lavish privilege being bestowed on any private enterprise , much less a business as large and profitable as Amazon . Such political cronyism is unfair and corrupt .\nTragically , such cronyism is often erroneously called \u201c crony capitalism. \u201d The truth is that there is no such thing as \u201c crony capitalism \u201d any more than there is \u201c liquid ice \u201d ; both terms are oxymorons . Capitalism is a social system of economic cooperation , based on private property and voluntary exchanges , in which the government plays the role of an impartial referee while consumers choose winners and losers in freely competitive marketplaces . Cronyism , on the other hand , is a repudiation of capitalism . With cronyism , the government abandons its role as impartial arbiter and instead intervenes to enrich special interests at the expense of everybody else . By its very nature , cronyism is a step toward socialism , because both involve the government picking economic winners and losers .\nProgressives deservedly win lots of popular support by opposing the abuses and unfairness of cronyism . Those of us who believe in free markets should oppose and denounce cronyism with equal vigor . When I read polls showing that capitalism is viewed with increasing negativity by Americans\u2014particularly young Americans\u2014I can \u2019 t help but feel that cronyism plays a big part in fostering that antipathy . What is so insidious about this is that people keep mislabeling cronyism as crony capitalism . Consequently , capitalism \u2019 s reputation sustains damage from unmerited association with the corrupt practice of cronyism .\nWe conservatives oppose cronyism because it is an assault on property rights and the rule of law . We can join with progressives in denouncing a privilege that politicians give to those who neither need it nor deserve it , and who certainly have no just claim to the wealth of their fellow citizens . If there is one area of public policy where left and right may unite today , it would be around the goal of eliminating the cronyism of corporate welfare .\nMark Hendrickson is an adjunct professor of economics and sociology at Grove City College .

It was black voters who carried him to a resounding win in South Carolina , reviving a candidacy that had appeared to be on its last legs , and ultimately helping make him the Democratic nominee . He officially secured the 1,991 delegates needed to claim the nomination this weekend .\nBut he is viewed less favorably by a younger , more left-wing generation , which sees him as too moderate to bring about needed change .

For three months , all campaign rallies have been canceled or turned into awkward \u201c virtual \u201d events , making it difficult for a candidate who thrives on rope lines and personal connections to reach voters .\nThe nominee \u2019 s acceptance speech at the party convention is typically an important moment , notes Mr. Shrum . \u201c Just look at Al Gore in 2000 , \u201d he says . \u201c He gained 15 to 18 points in 47 minutes. \u201d But this year \u2019 s Democratic convention is increasingly looking like it will be held online , diminishing Mr. Biden \u2019 s ability to generate a big bounce .\nIt \u2019 s also unclear if televised debates between the candidates will happen . In a debate , Mr. Biden would have an opportunity to try to blunt Mr. Trump \u2019 s charges that the former vice president is \u201c senile \u201d and \u201c sleepy , \u201d just as John F. Kennedy countered Richard Nixon \u2019 s claims that he was too young and inexperienced to assume the presidency in 1960 .\nIn the potential absence of these traditional events , Mr. Biden will need to be creative in how he engages voters , says Mr. Shrum . And his vice presidential pick will likely carry even more weight \u2013 not only because of Mr. Biden \u2019 s age , but also because of the absence of other high-profile campaign moments .\nAbove all , say several strategists , Mr. Biden needs to try to stay in the public eye as he has over the past week , and propose policies that follow through on his promise to bring unity .\n\u201c Part of [ Mr. Trump \u2019 s ] strategy will be to undermine voters \u2019 confidence in Joe Biden , \u201d says Monmouth \u2019 s Mr. Murray . \u201c That \u2019 s why Biden has to be out there \u2013 so he can change people \u2019 s minds from \u2018 I think he can do a good job \u2019 to \u2018 I know he can do a good job . \u2019 \u201d\nAt the same time , Mr. Biden has made a point throughout the campaign of keeping the focus less on himself and more on the country .\nIn 2019 , Mr. Biden \u2019 s campaign announcement video was centered on Charlottesville , Virginia , where two years earlier white supremacists had shocked the nation as they marched with tiki torches . In the video , Mr. Biden referenced Mr. Trump \u2019 s response to the event as a key moment that pushed him to run for president .\n\u201c We are in a battle for the soul of this nation , \u201d he said . \u201c We can \u2019 t forget what happened in Charlottesville .

Advocates of the current approach , including consumer groups and big internet companies , argued that such regulation is needed to curb the power of the broadband providers to unfairly dominate the online environment through their control over the pipes .\nProponents of reversing them , including current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai , say hard-and-fast rules can stifle investment and innovation in a fast-moving industry . Internet service providers worried the Obama administration rules could open the door to eventual rate regulation and other heavy-handed oversight . They also viewed the rules as a solution in search of a problem , given the internet \u2019 s relative openness historically .\n\u201c The winners are clearly the network operators , \u201d said Recon Analytics Inc. researcher Roger Entner . He said the internet service providers would be able to more aggressively pursue specialized services for medical customers and self-driving cars , both of which could benefit from faster broadband speeds .\nIt remains to be seen how much the rules \u2019 demise might help the telecommunications industry \u2019 s bottom line , however , said Cowen Co. analyst Paul Gallant .\nBig internet companies , which supported the Obama administration rules , protested the move through their industry trade association .\n\u201c There is simply no reasonable justification for repealing the net neutrality protections currently on the books , \u201d said Michael Beckerman , president and chief executive officer of the Internet Association . \u201c Consumers are paying for access to the entire internet , and [ internet providers ] should not be able to discriminate against websites and apps . \u201d\nMr. Pai began the process of reversing the 2015 rules earlier this year .\nIf the rollback survives likely legal challenges , it has the potential to reorder the online business environment .

It also suggests they \u2019 re eager to find new ways to hit back at what they see as unfavorable and unfair press coverage .\nMotherboard obtained a recording of the conversation , which took place on Clubhouse , an app which as of late May had just 1,500 users . The app was valued at $ 100 million after a reported $ 12 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz , and requires an invite to join . In May , New York Times internet culture reporter Taylor Lorenz wrote that the app is `` where venture capitalists have gathered to mingle with one another while they are quarantined in their homes . ''\n`` Sometimes there is a tarot card reader critiquing a member \u2019 s Instagram account ; sometimes it is a dating advice show ; sometimes bored people sound off about anything that pops into their mind , '' she wrote .\nOn Wednesday night , the topic of conversation was Lorenz herself , who had been listening earlier in the conversation but left partway through . After she left , the participants began discussing whether Lorenz was playing `` the woman card '' when speaking out about her harassment following a Twitter altercation with Srinivasan .\n`` You ca n't fucking hit somebody , attack them and just say , 'Hey , I have ovaries and therefore , you ca n't fight back , ' '' Felicia Horowitz , founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz , said .\nIn recent days Lorenz , who criticized luggage startup Away co-CEO Steph Korey on Twitter Wednesday , has been harassed and impersonated on Twitter .\nOn the call , Srinivasan suggested that Lorenz\u2014who earlier in the day had accused him on Twitter of `` constantly trying to destroy my career on the internet and in private '' \u2014was overreacting and that she was perhaps scared of him , and that this was why she left the conversation that night on Clubhouse .\n`` Is Taylor afraid of a brown man on the street ? Then she should n't be afraid of a brown man in Clubhouse , '' Srinivasan said . `` I have literally done nothing other than one previous tweet . Number one , right ? So the whole , you know , talking about tweeting as you know , harassment\u2014completely illegitimate , completely wrong , completely fabricated and just false . ''\nThe audio chat had spiraled wildly out of control from a broader conversation earlier in the call about the state of journalism and what VCs should do to receive better coverage . Srinivasan , formerly a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz , claimed that `` the entire tech press was complicit in covering up the threat of COVID-19 , '' and claimed that relying on the press is `` outsourcing your information supply chain to folks who are disaligned with you , '' comparable to the United States having outsourced its medical supply chain . He proposed that the approaches to truth and accountability offered by GitHub , venture capital funding , and cryptocurrency all offer better models for journalism than `` the East Coast model of 'Respect my authori-tay . ' ''\nWhen asked for comment about the Clubhouse chat , Srinivasan screenshotted our request and tweeted about it .\n`` When it comes to our industry , there \u2019 s a really , really toxic dynamic that exists right now , '' Nait Jones , an Andreessen Horowitz VC , said on the call while speaking about recent reports about abuse in the tech industry . `` Because those stories were so popular and drove so much traffic , they also created a market for more of those stories . They created a pressure on many reporters to find the next one of those stories inside of a fast growing tech company because those stories play very well on Twitter , especially around protecting vulnerable people . ''\n( In 2020 , the idea that fishing for \u201c clicks \u201d to drive ad revenue is a successful or even common business model is a fallacy . Publications that rely exclusively on advertising are failing at an astonishing rate ; financially , many journalistic outlets are increasingly moving away from an ad-based revenue model driven by traffic , and instead focus on live events , subscriptions , optioning their articles to movie studios , and other models that rely on having a dedicated readership that trusts the publication ) .\nThe exclusive users of Clubhouse on the call seemed to conceive of themselves as humble citizens preyed upon by corrupted elites cravenly lusting after money and power ; this reached a bizarre apogee when Srinivasan boasted of standing up for the CEO of a scandal-plagued luggage brand , depicting her as all but powerless because of her relatively low Twitter follower count . The conversation essentially resembled a Gamergate chat , with people obsessing over minute drama and , at times , suggesting that Lorenz had crossed a line on Twitter and must be punished .\n`` How can there be an accountability function that 's implementable across all media that allows for that to happen , that pushback to happen without it being turned around and can become some toxic thing where all types of power dynamics are being used , and people have their weapons out , '' Jones said .\n`` Her employer should be saying , you cross the line with your editorial comments , '' Martin said , adding that `` If I 'm [ Srinivasan ] , the argument that I would make to her bosses is you should be instructing your reporters not to be making editorial judgments about someone . Stick to reporting . ''\n\u201c Taylor is an excellent reporter doing incredibly relevant reporting for this moment . She , and all reporters , should be able to do their jobs without facing harassment , \u201d Choire Sicha , editor of the NYTimes Styles desk , told Motherboard in an email .\nClubhouse founders Rothan Seth and Paul Davison did n't respond to a request for comment . Jones did not respond to a request for comment . Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment .\nThe conversation was set off by a series of exhausting , insidery events from the last two weeks . Some in the Silicon Valley set turned their sights on the Times after Scott Alexander , a psychiatrist who ran the philosophy blog SlateStarCodex , deleted the entire blog because he said the Times was going to `` dox '' him by publishing his real name in an upcoming story . ( It is worth noting that Alexander has republished SlateStarCodex blogs in books using his full name . ) This event resurfaced an ongoing and tedious discussion among venture capitalist types about journalism ethics , business models , and publishing incentives .\nWednesday , Korey , the co-CEO of Away , a direct to consumer luggage brand that was the subject of an expose in The Verge last year , published a series of Instagram Story posts in which she suggested that she was unfairly targeted by The Verge in part because she is a woman . She also said that journalists should be easier to sue , and suggested that the main thing driving journalism is `` clicks . '' The Verge story focused on a culture of abuse at Away under Korey 's leadership ; workers there said they were prevented from taking vacation , were banned from emailing each other , and worked extremely long hours .\nWhile Korey \u2019 s Instagram comments were a supposed critique of the journalism industry , they looked at times a lot more like a claim that The Verge story was unfair or inaccurate in ways she didn \u2019 t actually address .\nAfter Korey posted her stories on Instagram , a number of journalists commented on them , including Lorenz , who tweeted `` Steph Korey , the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company , is ranting on IG stories about the media . Her posts are incoherent and it \u2019 s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of . ''\nLorenz 's tweet was immediately tweeted about by several Silicon Valley venture capitalists , most notably Srinivasan , who eventually made a seven-tweet thread in which he suggested Lorenz , and journalists like her , are `` sociopaths . ''\nThat same day , a self-described Taylor Lorenz `` parody '' Twitter account started retweeting Srinivasan and other tech investors and executives critical of her work . The account 's bio also links to a website , also self-described as parody , which is dedicated to harassing Lorenz . ( Twitter told Motherboard it deleted another account for impersonating Lorenz . )\nYesterday Lorenz called out Srinivasan on Twitter by tagging him and asked his friends , like Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz , to help end the conflict , which eventually continued on Clubhouse .\nIn Korey 's analysis , exposing the conditions of workers is clickbait designed to attract eyeballs ; she also argued that female founders were more likely to be attacked , especially by young female reporters . The story about Korey \u2019 s alleged misconduct was written by a young reporter named Zoe Schiffer . Korey added a few minutes later that she \u2019 d gotten word her comments were filtering through to Twitter , and wrote , in part , \u201c I believe the overwhelming majority of young female reporters are truly excellent . It has been the case that the female-founder takedowns tend to be written by young women , but I do not think they represent the whole demographic whatsoever . \u201d\nKorey \u2019 s avid defenders in the Clubhouse conversation agreed with that analysis .\n\u201c The coverage seems to be so one-sided around the people running the companies , \u201d one person on the call whom Motherboard could not immediately identify complained . \u201c They 're all abusers , they 're all trying to get rich . It 's just down , down , down . It 's almost depressing to watch , as someone who 's an advocate for building things . It 's hard to watch the coverage , it 's almost anti-building things ... The whole entire DNA of Silicon Valley has been optimism from day one . ''\nArticles like the Verge 's investigation into Away do not appear out of thin air . People who work at tech companies\u2014often burdened with non-disclosure agreements\u2014take risks to discuss labor conditions at their company . At the time the Verge article was published , Korey apologized . Wednesday , she was suggesting she 'd been unfairly targeted , and that `` a few who are using the media platform they have access to further their careers by knowingly misrepresenting female founders for clicks & their own profile/fame . ''\n`` I spoke up for her because she had , you know , 8,000 followers , and she was being attacked by a New York Times reporter as a disgraced former CEO and she 's actually still , you know , current co-CEO , '' Srinivasan said . `` I believe in standing up for those people who do n't have a voice , who can not stand up for themselves . ''\nLost in the shuffle are the employees who say this apparently powerless CEO still presides over a broken company . Thursday afternoon , a coalition of Away employees emailed Away 's leadership to say that `` Steph 's Comments Are Hurting Us . ''\nWe \u201c have been hurt and left deflated by Steph Korey \u2019 s recent action on Instagram and Twitter , '' they wrote in the email , which was obtained by Motherboard and was acknowledged by Away 's cofounder Jen Rubio . `` We are writing to you as the employees of Away and asking that something is done to address the story that is building around Steph 's Instagram and Twitter comments over the last several days .\nSteph has been largely absent during this health pandemic , the company 's layoffs and the civil unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter . This made sense . She was on mat leave and taking time to focus on her personal life over her professional one . This is why her social media activity over the last few days has been so surprising and frankly hurtful as employees of this company . ''\nKorey and Away 's cofounders did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\nIn response to a request for comment from Motherboard , Away 's \u2588\u2588\u2588 president of communications and corporate affairs shared two screenshots . The first was an email from Jen Rubio , Away 's co-founder , president , and Chief Brand Officer , addressed to the employees who had complained about Korey 's comments . ( The email comes from Rubio 's email account ; it 's also cosigned by Stuart Haselden , the company 's co-CEO ) .\nRubio wrote that Korey 's comments `` do not reflect or affect our current company priorities and the deep work we 're doing about diversity , equity and inclusion . '' The email also stated that Stuart Haselden will take on the role of sole CEO at Away in 2020 , and that Korey has updated her social media profiles to state that her views are her own .\nIn her own Slack response , Korey wrote : `` I understand that I have a responsibility as co-founder and co-CEO to commit to using my personal platforms to support our priorities , not distract by them . '' She apologized to `` anyone I hurt by shifting the focus away from these important cultural moments this past week , '' referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and the company 's stated commitment to `` Diversity , Equity and Inclusion , '' as Korey put it . Both statements say Away 's priority is `` becoming an anti-racist company . ''", "In Wednesday 's televised impeachment hearing , U.S . Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official George Kent `` did not paint a flattering portrait of our president , and his bootlickers in the House did n't look too good , either , '' Jimmy Kimmel said on Wednesday 's Kimmel Live . `` The president called the hearing a 'joke , ' a 'sham , ' and a 'hoax , ' and he said he did n't watch it . A White House spokesperson said the president was too busy working . Right . They might as well have said he was at a Zumba class . ''\nIn reality , Trump spent the hearing `` tweeting and retweeting all of these things from right-wing Twitter feeds , in between hosting one of his favorite foreign strongmen , Turkish President Erdogan , '' Kimmel said . `` Trump says he 's a big fan of Erdogan , who last month notably slaughtered our allies , the Kurds . ''\n`` Trump got things off to a great start by mispronouncing President Erdogan 's name , '' Stephen Colbert said on The Late Show . He also dismissed Trump 's claim he was too busy to watch the hearings : `` No you 're not ! For Pete 's sake , you live-tweeted Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars ! ''\nYes , `` apparently Trump did n't watch , '' Jimmy Fallon said at The Tonight Show . `` Trump wanted to , but he threw his TV remote out the window when he was n't named People Magazine 's Sexiest Man of the Year . '' Taylor 's testimony `` was brutal for Trump , '' Fallon said . `` He clearly outlined how the president tried to get Ukraine to investigate Biden in exchange for aid . Which means it 's the second time in Trump 's life that his cover-up did n't work . ''\n`` Trump claimed he did not watch the televised impeachment hearings , '' Conan O'Brien said on Conan . `` When asked what he was doing , Trump said , ' I was cleaning out my desk . ' '' On Wednesday , he added , `` new evidence against President Trump was called damning . Some say this could end his presidency . No , wait , I 'm sorry , this joke is from two years ago . ''\n`` Today was the first time in over 20 years that Congress has held a public impeachment hearing , '' Seth Meyers said at Late Night . `` And if this one is anything like the last one , Trump will be impeached , then be acquitted in the Senate , and then in 20 years his wife will lose an election to some idiot . ''", "The left is in a veritable state of hysteria as the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) moves to vote on Chairman Pai 's deregulatory `` Restoring Internet Freedom '' ( RIF ) order on Dec. 14 . It 's gotten so bad that incensed supporters of so-called `` net neutrality '' have taken to harassing commissioners ' children and even threatening to kill a congressman .\nIt 's a nasty state of affairs , and it 's one unfortunately driven by a lot of false rhetoric and outright fearmongering over how policy is actually changing . Telling people that a policy change will `` end the internet as we know it '' or `` kill the internet '' can agitate troubled people into doing crazy things .\nIn truth , the Obama administration-era `` Open Internet Order '' ( OIO ) that the FCC is overturning has little to with `` net neutrality '' at all . In fact , the OIO would still allow internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block content\u2014to say nothing of the many non-ISP tech companies that can and do openly suppress access to content .\nFurthermore , repealing the OIO does not mean that the principles of `` net neutrality '' will not be upheld , nor that ISPs will be `` unregulated . '' Rather , the RIF will rightly transfer oversight of ISPs to other regulatory bodies in an ex post fashion .\nOne of the biggest misconceptions of the OIO saga is that it achieved `` net neutrality . '' It did n't . While proponents like to spin a lot of rhetoric about `` treating all traffic equally , '' the actual implementation of the Obama administration 's regulations did nothing of the sort .\nAs my Mercatus Center colleague Brent Skorup has tirelessly pointed out , the OIO did not require all internet actors\u2014ranging from ISPs to content platforms to domain name registrars and everything else\u2014to be content-blind and treat all traffic the same . Rather , it erected an awkward permission-and-control regime within the FCC that only affected a small portion of internet technology companies .\nNot even ISPs would be truly content-neutral under the OIO . Because of First Amendment concerns , the FCC could not legally prohibit ISPs from engaging in editorial curation . The U.S. Court of Appeals made this very clear in its 2016 decision upholding the OIO . ISPs that explicitly offer `` 'edited ' services '' to its customers would be virtually free from OIO obligations . It 's a huge loophole , and it massively undercuts any OIO proponent 's claims that they are supporting `` net neutrality . ''\nBut importantly , the OIO still allowed the vast majority of internet companies to filter and block away to their heart 's content . Indeed , one could argue that content aggregators and search engines , like Facebook and Google , have proven to be much more draconian in their censorship of controversial but legal content than the ISPs over which so many agonize . Consider the recent incident where Twitter decided to block the political speech of a pro-life American politician . Most people are far more worried that social media companies will block their content rather than Comcast or Verizon .\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai made this very point last week at an R Street Institute event on the repeal . Major edge service providers like Google , Facebook , Reddit , and Twitter have made their opposition to OIO deregulation loud and clear to their user base . Some have displayed automatic messages on their front pages , urging visitors to take action and encourage others to do the same . Yet at the same time , these services engage in kinds of content blocking that they say broadband providers could possibly do .\nThis hypocrisy is relevant for more than just ideological inconsistency . It 's about economic power . By encouraging harsh regulation of ISPs that effectively controls the rates that major tech companies can be charged for bandwidth , these companies are engaging in a kind of regulatory capture . ( It should be noted that there is some division within these firms : Google 's Eric Schmidt , for instance , famously discouraged the Obama administration from pursuing these regulations in 2014 . )\nNot only is it unfair , it is absolutely disingenuous to the user bases that they have so inflamed with their rhetoric . These companies are not taking principled stands at all . They are trying to use the force of the state to improve their economic outlook . In Pai 's words , `` they might cloak their advocacy in the public interest , but the real interest of these Internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the Internet economy . ''\nThe second biggest misconception about the OIO repeal is that consumers will simply be at the mercy of unscrupulous broadband service providers without recourse or protection . This has never been true , and will not be true under the RIF either .\nOIO supporters imagine a world where ISPs slice and dice internet access into tiered packages , similar to cable subscriptions . This misleading image is a popular one : It shows a hypothetical broadband package where consumers are forced to pay $ 10 for a `` Hollywood '' package including YouTube and Hulu , and a $ 5 `` Playground '' offering access to Steam and World of Warcraft . Of course , no ISP has ever come close to proposing anything like this arrangement , but this scenario has curiously lodged itself as a chief anxiety of many `` net neutrality '' supporters .\nRecently , this hypothetical fear metastasized into a seemingly real threat . None other than Tim Wu himself , the brains behind the concept of `` net neutrality , '' shared a scary story about the dystopian world of Portuguese broadband provision , where ISPs had seemingly started to act more like cable companies . An image shared by Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna seemed to confirm this worst-case-scenario , sharing an image of a breakdown of Portuguese telecom packages by category .\nBut there was a huge problem with this story , as an excellent post by Ben Thompson pointed out . That Portuguese telecom provider was not slicing and dicing the 'net for no \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but rather was an offer for an extra 10 GB of access to a collection of apps on top of the existing family data plan for \u20ac25 a month , or about $ 30 . There are examples from the U.S. , too . In 2010 , then-tiny MetroPCS began offering zero-rated , or discounted , access to YouTube content to be competitive . But net neutrality activists went berserk over this benefit to MetroPCS customers , putting this and similar services in legal jeopardy . Consumers like these kinds of plans because they can be cheaper than all-inclusive data packages while giving them access to the services that they really need .\nThese kinds of unhelpful hoaxes underscore the fears that `` net neutrality '' rhetoric has instilled into the public . Sometimes , as is the case with Portuguese example , an alleged `` violation '' is actually a valued ( and voluntary ! ) option for many consumers . But in general , people believe that the OIO repeal will usher in a world where ISPs can do whatever they want without having to answer to anyone . Of course , this was not true before the OIO was instituted in 2015 , and it will be even less true under the RIF .\nThe debate has never been over `` regulation '' vs. `` no regulation '' of ISPs . Rather , it 's a question of whether it is more appropriate for an oversight body to observe market activities and intervene when foul play is suspected , called `` ex post regulation , '' or whether a beefed-up precautionary regulator should preemptively prohibit new service innovations until private bodies can prove them to be in the public interest , known as `` ex ante regulation . ''\nThe latter approach obviously stems new innovation and investment considerably , and in fact a study from the Phoenix Center found that broadband investment was choked to the tune of some $ 30 billion each year due to the OIO . Furthermore , introducing a Soviet-style ex ante regulator into the mix creates opportunities for regulatory capture and corruption .\nThe RIF will actually provide a more robust regulatory framework that then one that proceeded the OIO . It will transfer oversight of ISPs to the Federal Trade Commission , which has decades of experience ensuring consumer protection , privacy , and security . It will return to transparency rules established by the FCC in 2010 , which would require broadband providers to disclose their network management practices , thereby cutting down on the potential for sneaky behavior . And most importantly , it would achieve these `` neutral network '' goals without erecting a Depression-era system of permission and control that is both costly and susceptible to corruption .\nThe OIO allowed content filtering anyway . The RIF is a far better way to promote a fair and innovative internet that does not bring the many costs of the OIO .\nPeople who maintain that the sky will fall and the internet will forever change for the worse after the FCC votes to ratify the RIF later this month are either misinformed or unfortunately opportunistic . Moving oversight of ISPs from a permissioned ex ante regulatory regime to a permissionless ex post one not only makes plain sense , it is the kind of framework that allowed the internet to develop into the powerhouse of innovation that we enjoy today . The internet is important in our lives , and it is easy to see how people can get upset when they are told that a policy change will ruin it forever . But a brief examination of the facts shows no such threat , and in fact the RIF is what can actually preserve the internet that we all know and love .", "Well , it was bound to happen eventually . After near three years of all-out rhetorical war against tech giants , for politically-shifting sins including bigness , too much censorship , not enough censorship , data hoarding , and being too irresistible , policymakers are ready to move beyond cheap talk and start slapping wrists\u2014or more .\nSpecifically , regulators and Congress recently announced new antitrust scrutiny against Silicon Valley . The House Judiciary Committee cheerfully launched a `` bipartisan investigation into competition into digital markets . '' Nothing can bring us all together these days quite like hating the online services we use most . No particular firms have been named , but we can expect the usual suspects are due for a thrashing .\nRegulators , on the other hand , are dividing and conquering . The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) sliced up the pig , with DOJ taking on Google and Apple , and the FTC going after Facebook and Amazon . The Wall Street Journal reports that Google and Facebook are the real targets , for now .\nTech companies knew this was coming . How could they not ? Presidential hopefuls compete over who wants to break up tech giants the most . New books like The Curse of Bigness : Antitrust in the New Gilded Age by superstar law professor ( and father of `` net neutrality '' ) Tim Wu warn that lax antitrust enforcement could spawn a new Nazism ( really ) . In February , the FTC set up an antitrust taskforce for the sole purpose of preparing actions against the big guys . It was always a question of when , not if .\nBigness is badness in the minds of most people . But in terms of U.S. law at least , being big is not a crime .\nRather , as an essay by my Mercatus colleagues Adam Thierer and Jennifer Huddleston points out , American antitrust is only intended to be used when `` a firm has the ability to monopolize a sector , or it possesses an 'essential facility ' that can not be replicated . ''\nLaws like the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act give agencies substantial powers to clamp down on monopolies . So antitrust enforcers have developed a robust jurisprudence on what is and is not kosher . Some things , like price fixing , are so `` inherently harmful '' that they are always illegal .\nBut in general , the U.S. antitrust approach places the consumer at the center of the analysis . We do n't punish businesses because they have been exceptional at meeting consumer demand . Rather , the government steps in if a business engages in anti-competitive activities that harm customers , like obliterating the competition with low prices before jacking them up on consumers that have no other option\u2014classic monopolistic behavior .\nDoes n't that just make sense ? Consider the alternative . The government could break up or limit any firm that is simply a great competitor . Consumers are actually served well by this giant . But their competitors of course will grumble for their nemesis to be taken down a few pegs .\nIn this conception of antitrust , the government essentially protects the bottom lines of competitors who ca n't keep up . Before U.S. courts settled on the economics-grounded consumer welfare standard that has guided U.S. antitrust for decades , trust-busting activities were often little more than handouts to interest groups .\nNot only would court cases counterintuitively seek to keep prices high , to the detriment of consumers , judges worked a host of non-antitrust hobbyhorses into their decisions . Maybe one judge had a particular fondness for `` social equality . '' The antitrust decisions he handed down might have aimed for that totally unrelated , arguably impossible outcome .\nThe European approach to antitrust is more like the muddled U.S. approach before it settled on the consumer welfare standard . Some in the U.S. would like our antitrust posture to be more like Europe 's , but at least for now , it is limited to the scribblings of theorists in the land of the free .\nWith that crash course in antitrust theory under our belt , we can now ask : What will the U.S. do about Facebook and Google ?\nSome people would like to see the companies broken up . They propose surgical cuts : Facebook must relinquish WhatsApp and Instagram , while parent company Alphabet could spin off feeder products from advertising-funded search .\nOn what grounds ? We know that bigness per se is no crime . Are these companies `` essential facilities '' that left fewer , more expensive options for consumers ?\nThe problem is that many of these companies ' products cost us nothing , at least in terms of dollars . It does n't look like Facebook or Google have been lowering product quality , either . In general , there 's a lot of competition when it comes to social media platforms and search , even if people choose not to use them very much .\nOnline platforms like Facebook and Google are tricky when it comes to antitrust because they essentially serve two markets : users and advertisers .\nWhen it comes to users , there are plenty of alternatives . Advertisers , too have plenty of alternatives : they can buy spots on television , the radio , billboards , in newspapers , and even via costumed sign-waver on the side of the road .\nBut for online ads , there are basically two games in town : Facebook and Google . My colleague Brent Skorup pointed out to me that recent precedent could indicate that the courts will consider `` the ad market and the social media market as components of a single relevant market . '' If so , Facebook and Google could be looking at serious antitrust enforcement .\nAntitrust actions take a long time , and by the time a remedy\u2014good or bad\u2014is chosen , the market may have already moved on . This is particularly the case in a fast-moving space like tech . Consider the drawn-out cases against IBM and Microsoft . On the other side of the decades-long court cases , the issues that so vexed regulators had long ago become moot . What were the costs to consumers and innovation in the process ?\nThe problem is that regulators have a static mindset . They see a slice of a market in time , deem one actor too powerful , and seek to artificially create `` more competition '' to freeze this market in time . But that 's not how markets progress . As venture capitalist Benedict Evans points out , `` Tech anti-trust too often wants to insert a competitor to the winning monopolist , when it 's too late . Meanwhile , the monopolist is made irrelevant by something that comes from totally outside the entire conversation and owes nothing to any anti-trust interventions . ''\nIn the meantime , antitrust actions are often wasteful , distracting , and can limit consumer choice . We still do n't how this new round of trust-busting will shake out . But it 's a good chance that by the time we 're on the other side , a new class of unassailable giants will have cropped up without regulators noticing . And then we can start the theatrics all over again .\nThis column has been updated to correct Tim Wu 's occupation .", "Republicans on Monday blasted Secretary of State John Kerry for suggesting in a letter to his Iranian counterpart that the administration could help the country get around new visa restrictions passed by Congress .\n\u201c Instead of bending over backwards to try to placate the Iranian regime , the White House needs to be holding it accountable for its recent missile tests , its continued support for terrorism , and its wrongful imprisonment of Americans , \u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce , R-Calif. , said in a statement to FoxNews.com .\nAt issue are tightened security requirements for America \u2019 s visa waiver program , which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U.S. without visas . Under changes in the newly signed spending bill , people from those countries who have traveled to Iran , Iraq , Syria and Sudan in the past five years must now obtain visas to enter the U.S .\nTop Tehran officials , however , complained the changes violate the terms of the nuclear deal , which says the U.S. and other world powers will refrain from any policy intended to adversely affect normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran .\nKerry responded to these concerns in a Dec. 19 letter to his Iranian counterpart , Mohammad Javad Zarif -- and suggested the administration could simply bypass the rules for Iran .\n\u201c I am also confident that the recent changes in visa requirements passed in Congress , which the Administration has the authority to waive , will not in any way prevent us from meeting our [ nuclear deal ] commitments , and that we will implement them so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of Iran , \u201d he said .\nKerry \u2019 s letter to Zarif assured that the U.S. would \u201c adhere to the full measure of our commitments. \u201d As for changes to the visa program , Kerry floated several alternative options for easing any impact on Iran \u2013 including waiving the new requirements .\n\u201c To this end , we have a number of potential tools available to us , including multiple entry ten-year business visas , programs for expediting business visas , and the waiver authority provided under the new legislation , \u201d he wrote .\nThe legislation indeed includes a provision allowing the Homeland Security secretary to waive the requirements if the secretary determines this \u201c is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States . \u201d\nBut House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , voiced concern on Monday that Kerry was proposing a \u201c blanket \u201d waiver to accommodate Iran \u2019 s complaints . He said that is not Congress \u2019 intent .\n\u201c Contrary to what the Secretary of State seems to be saying to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif , it was not and has never been Congress \u2019 s intent to allow the Administration to grant a blanket waiver to travellers from Iran in order to facilitate the implementation of the Iran deal , \u201d he said in a statement .\nMcCarthy said the point of the legislation was to strengthen security and \u201c keep the American people safe from terrorism and from foreign travelers who potentially pose a threat to our homeland . \u201d\nKerry \u2019 s assurances also raised concerns that the U.S. may be backing down to Iran \u2019 s complaints while at the same time reluctant to punish Tehran for its own potential violations .\n\u201c Instead of undermining Congressional intent regarding the visa waiver program , the White House should instead focus on Iran \u2019 s repeated violations of the U.N. Security Council 's bans on missile tests , \u201d McCarthy said . \u201c Iran \u2019 s unwillingness to follow these international agreements should be a red flag that the Iran nuclear deal isn \u2019 t worth the paper it is written on . \u201d\nOmri Ceren , with the Washington , D.C.-based Israel Project , also told The Washington Free Beacon , \u201c According to the Obama administration \u2019 s latest interpretation , the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law , but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States . \u201d\nThe same article noted that the State Department official in charge of implementing the nuclear agreement warned Congress last week that the new visa rules \u201c could have a very negative impact on the deal . \u201d\nIndeed , Kerry \u2019 s letter came as top-ranking Iranian officials accused the U.S. of flouting the nuclear agreement .\nIran \u2019 s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the change \u201c contradicts \u201d the nuclear deal .\n`` Definitely , this law adversely affects economic , cultural , scientific and tourism relations , \u201d Araghchi was quoted by state TV as saying .\nAsked about Kerry \u2019 s assurances at Monday \u2019 s daily briefing , State Department spokesman John Kirby said the secretary made clear they would \u201c implement this new legislation so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of Iran . \u201d\nKirby said the law would be followed , but there are a \u201c number of potential tools \u201d to ensure this does not violate the nuclear deal . As for the DHS waiver authority , he said it \u2019 s too soon to say \u201c if and when \u201d that might be used .\nThe Kerry letter initially was obtained and published by the National Iranian American Council .", "WASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired via Twitter after returning from an Africa trip during which he was out of the loop on North Korean talks and contradicted the White House position on Russia 's responsibility for poisoning a former double agent in the United Kingdom .\nIn other words , his last week on the job was like many others in his 405-day tenure as the nation 's top diplomat \u2014 the shortest of any secretary of State to begin an administration since Elihu B. Washburne 's 11-day service in 1869 .\nTillerson often found himself on the outer ring of President Trump 's inner circle , trying to interpret the president 's mercurial and contradictory foreign policy to the rest of the world .\nHe reassured NATO allies that the United States remained committed to the alliance after the president threatened to pull out over `` dues '' that Trump said were owed directly to the United States . ( They were n't . )\nHe engaged with North Korea despite the president 's protests \u2014 again via Twitter \u2014 that he was `` wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man . \u201d\nAnd he tried to salvage the Iran nuclear deal through a European-brokered fix to the Obama-era agreement rather than having Trump scuttle the deal completely .\nIn explaining his break with Tillerson on Tuesday , Trump specifically cited those differences over the Iran deal : `` I think it 's terrible . I guess he feels it was OK . ''\nBut Trump 's comments give a glimpse into why he 's making this move now .\nTrump is heading into an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with North Korea 's Kim Jong Un over that country 's nuclear program . The timing of Tillerson 's dismissal was designed to allow Trump to put a new team in place before those talks , a White House official said on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel decision .\nTrump 's nominee to replace Tillerson is CIA Director Mike Pompeo , whose hard-line stances on Iran and North Korea are closer to Trump 's .\nTrump conceded Tuesday that he and Tillerson often were not on the same page . `` I actually got along well with Rex , but really , it was a different mind-set . It was a different thinking .\n`` With Mike Pompeo , '' he said , `` we have a similar thought process . ''\nNorth Korea hawks applauded Pompeo 's nomination . `` No one understands the threat posed by North Korea and Iran better than he does , '' said Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-S.C .\nBut Sen. Ben Cardin , D-Md. , said he feared Trump was stocking his Cabinet with yes men . `` It is disturbing to see such a high-level change in our diplomatic team as negotiations with North Korea move into a new and delicate stage , '' he said .\nWhile Tillerson was in Africa last week , it was Pompeo who explained Trump 's unexpected rapprochement with North Korea on CBS ' Face the Nation Sunday .\nPompeo would not be pinned down on whether he or the secretary of State would lead the preliminary talks before the Trump-Kim summit . His appointment to Tillerson 's post would resolve that conflict and put him unambiguously in charge of getting Trump and Kim to the table .\nThe White House announced the personnel moves through an increasingly common playbook : a leak , a tweet and written statements from those involved . In this case : Trump , Pompeo and CIA nominee Gina Haspel .\nTillerson 's side of the story came from Steve Goldstein , undersecretary of State for public diplomacy .\n`` The secretary had every intention of staying because of critical progress made in national security , '' he said . `` The secretary did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason . ''\nGoldstein was then fired for contradicting the White House 's account of Tillerson 's dismissal .\nLater , Tillerson appeared in a State Department auditorium to give a statement to reporters . He talked about the hard work it took to get North Korea to the table : ending President Obama 's policy of `` strategic patience '' and replacing it with a maximum-pressure campaign to rally the world to impose punishing sanctions on the North Korean regime .\nHe thanked his diplomats , the military and the American people \u2014 but not Trump .", "The Obama administration acknowledged Monday that the FBI found at least 14,900 more email messages former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton never turned over to the government , and officials are facing intense pressure to release them ahead of November \u2019 s election .\nA federal judge ordered the State Department to speed up the process , and the Republican National Committee said the administration should strive to release an initial set of the secret emails within a month , or when the first states conduct early voting .\nThe existence of the emails marks yet more trouble for Mrs. Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee , who insisted she turned over all of her work-related messages in December 2014 .\nRep. Lamar Smith , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee , issued subpoenas Monday demanding answers from three technology companies that helped set up or maintain Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s unique email arrangement and demanding to know what kind of security she took to prevent hacks .\nAnother part of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email story \u2014 that former Secretary Colin L. Powell gave her the idea of using a secret account \u2014 also crumbled after Mr. Powell disputed it . He said he sent Mrs. Clinton a memo a year after she took office , meaning she couldn \u2019 t have been relying on his suggestion .\n\u201c Her people have been trying to pin it on me , \u201d Mr. Powell said , according to the New York Post and People magazine , who caught up with him at a social function in New York over the weekend .\nMrs. Clinton refused to use an official State Department email account during her four years in office . Instead , she conducted all of her business , including sending classified emails , from an account tied to a server she kept at her New York home . That arrangement effectively thwarted open-records laws and shielded her communications from the public for more than six years .\nState Department officials said they would try to work through the newly discovered messages as quickly as possible , but their initial timeline meant the first disclosure wouldn \u2019 t be until the middle of October .\nJudge James E. Boasberg rejected that estimate Monday and ordered a faster schedule , saying the State Department has one month to appraise the first 14,900 emails and must report back by Sept. 23 on how it will release them .\nSome critics fear the Obama administration may try to slow the process and push the release of most of the messages past the November election .\n\u201c If they wanted the records out quickly , they \u2019 d be out quickly . If they don \u2019 t want the records out quickly , they \u2019 ll let politics intrude on the process and the American people won \u2019 t see them until Election Day , \u201d said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , which sued to get a look at all of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner couldn \u2019 t explain why the nearly 15,000 messages were coming to light now , after Mrs. Clinton assured federal judges that she had turned over all of her work-related messages .\nThe 14,900 messages are on one disk in a set of eight that the FBI turned over to the State Department last month , after the law enforcement agency completed a yearlong probe into Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nAmong the other seven disks are one containing what has been described as \u201c classified \u201d material and another containing the 30,000 or so messages Mrs. Clinton did turn back to the Obama administration in December 2014 . The contents of the remaining five disks are unclear , though the Obama administration says the set contains a lot of emails .\n\u201c There are tens of thousands , \u201d Lisa A. Olson , a Justice Department lawyer handling the case for the State Department , told Judge Boasberg .\nFor now , the first disk is the focus of Judicial Watch , the State Department and the judge , because all 14,900 of its emails are among those Mrs. Clinton didn \u2019 t turn over . Some of them may be personal \u2014 the messages about her yoga schedule or her daughter \u2019 s wedding plans \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton mentioned last year .\nBut FBI Director James B. Comey also has said thousands are work-related . They were obtained from Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s server and various email devices she used .\nThe State Department said it will finish \u201c ingesting \u201d all eight disks \u2019 contents this week and then will appraise the contents . After that , it will know the total number of documents and have a general idea of what is on them , and then it must process them , redacting private or protected information and asking other agencies to weigh in on potentially classified material .\nMs. Olson originally said the State Department would have an update in October and begin releasing documents on Oct. 14 , with releases to follow on Oct. 21 , Oct. 28 and Nov. 4 \u2014 each of the Fridays preceding the Nov. 8 election . The releases would likely continue well after the election .\nJudge Boasberg , though , said the department can work faster by focusing on the first disk \u2019 s emails . He said they will set a schedule when they meet next month .\nThe Republican National Committee insisted that the schedule be expedited so the first emails are released as early voting begins in the states near the end of September . It said all of the messages should be released before Election Day .\nIt \u2019 s unclear what sort of information will be found on the newly discovered emails or whether any of them contain classified information .\nThe FBI concluded that Mrs. Clinton was negligent in handling classified information on her server but doubted a criminal case could be made because the former senator , first lady and top diplomat was not \u201c sophisticated \u201d enough to understand the information she was looking at or the risks she was running with the technology .\nMr. Smith , the science committee chairman , issued subpoenas Monday to three tech companies that helped with Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email . He said the companies were defying his requests for information .\nThe companies were Datto , Inc. , which handled the backup of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s server ; Secnap Network Security Corp. , which sold a threat monitoring application for Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s server after she left the State Department ; and Platte River Networks , which helped run the server .\nMr. Smith said Secnap and Datto refused to cooperate voluntarily , insisting they needed permission of their client first . Meanwhile the attorney for Platte River ducked attempts to communicate with him , Mr. Smith said .\nRep. Donald S. Beyer Jr. , a Virginia Democrat who serves on the science committee , called the subpoenas \u201c a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars \u2026 for blatantly partisan purposes . \u201d", "President Donald Trump came into office promising to run the federal government like a private business , and , like almost any new chief executive officer , he \u2019 s looking to restructure .\nConversations with more than a dozen people in and outside of State who are involved in or monitoring the administration 's plans suggest some broad outlines are emerging about State 's future , including from proposed budget cuts accepted by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and from a 2016 Heritage Foundation report that laid out some dramatic ways to reshape the department .\nDeep cuts are expected to hit State \u2019 s environmental and cultural programs , while divisions that deal with arms control and military affairs may see consolidation . The number of special envoys , who focus on everything from climate change to LGBT issues , will be pared down . The counterterrorism bureau will likely escape unscathed , but diplomats who deal with economics or women \u2019 s issues may see some changes .\nAlthough it 's still early and much is in flux , anxiety is rife at State . That 's because , unlike in the past , the staffers are expecting not simply reshuffling or additional departments , but rather large cuts and the elimination of entire divisions . Even if Congress rejects the budget cuts proposed by the administration , as several leading lawmakers have indicated it will do , Tillerson is still expected to make major changes .\n\u201c I think there are some in the administration who are looking at this like a corporate reorganization , but one of the problems with a corporation , a business , is that the bottom line is earnings . But at the State Department , what is your bottom line ? \u201d asked Ronald Neumann , president of the American Academy of Diplomacy . \u201c Your bottom line involves the political part of security operations , the possibility of an unknown future crisis . It involves the protection of American citizens abroad and the promotion of American business . It \u2019 s very difficult to quantify . \u201d\nThe prospect of reorganization is especially weighing on staffers dealing with issues that do n't seem to be a top priority for the Trump administration , such as human rights . While many career officials said they \u2019 re not reflexively opposed to restructuring some operations , many are worried about shielding programs that have long been considered core to the U.S. diplomatic mission \u2014 and some \u201c are creatively trying to figure out how to make a case for keeping some of the programs running that they built , '' said a former State official who regularly speaks to current employees .\nEvery new secretary of state wants to make his or her mark on the department , which employs about 75,000 people worldwide . In a 2006 speech , Condoleezza Rice outlined a plan to shift hundreds of diplomatic positions from Europe to countries like China , India and Lebanon . And Hillary Clinton established a number of new positions at the department , including the ambassador-at-large for global women \u2019 s issues and the Office of Global Youth Issues .\n\u201c My sense is that Tillerson wants to go big , \u201d said a State Department official who 's familiar with the discussions . \u201c In terms of streamlining , he seems to like straight lines , direct lines , clear hierarchies with a small number of people reporting to him . \u201d\nTrump issued an executive order in mid-March asking Cabinet leaders for proposals by mid-September on how to restructure their agencies . The State Department declined to comment on Tillerson \u2019 s plans .\nIn the meantime , U.S. diplomats and others in the foreign policy realm are reading up on Trump \u2019 s budget proposals , looking for clues in administration officials \u2019 public and private statements and leafing through the Heritage report to game out likely scenarios . In some cases , Trump aides are willing to confirm their guesses .\nA Trump administration official told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the president will not name a special envoy for climate change . The climate envoy helped lead international global warming talks during the Obama administration and played a central role in clinching the nearly 200-nation Paris climate agreement .\nAlready , State \u2019 s political appointees have largely ceded their work on international climate issues to the White House , according to two people briefed on the arrangement , a move that gives warring factions in the West Wing heavy influence over whether the United States should pull out of the Paris deal .\nThere 's plenty of support across the State Department for scaling back the overall number of special envoys . Depending on how you count such envoys \u2014 a category some take to include so-called special representatives , coordinators and other advisers \u2014 there are about five dozen . Many of the slots have stayed vacant under Tillerson .\nThe envoys tend to reflect an administration \u2019 s priorities , so few expect the Trump team to keep the one dedicated to , say , closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay . But Congress may intervene to protect some of the slots : On March 10 , a bipartisan group of about 170 lawmakers wrote to Trump urging him to fill and keep the special envoy position dedicated to combating anti-Semitism , calling it a \u201c crucial office . \u201d\nPeople familiar with Trump transition talks told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this year that there was a belief that State should focus more on fighting terrorism and less on \u201c soft power \u201d subjects such as democracy promotion . And in proposing cutting the State Department \u2019 s fiscal year 2018 budget by about 30 percent , Trump aides specifically cast it as a \u201c hard power \u201d blueprint focused on boosting military might .\nBut former and current State officials say they don \u2019 t expect the elimination of the Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights and Labor \u2014 the very embodiment of \u201c soft power \u201d Trump aides dismiss . That \u2019 s because there \u2019 s strong support in Congress for that bureau , especially among Republicans worried about the rights of Christians in the Middle East .\n`` You can imagine a very long line of Democratic and Republican members of the Senate that would be very concerned '' if that bureau were axed , said a Senate Democratic aide who 's been in touch with Trump transition and administration officials about reorganization plans .\nMultiple sources pointed to the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations as one ripe for elimination . The bureau was established in 2011 under Clinton with the goal of trying to prevent and defuse conflicts . But critics say its role has never been well-defined , concerns echoed in a 2014 inspector general \u2019 s report .\nThe administration last month also proposed cutting some $ 2.9 billion from what remains of the current fiscal year \u2019 s budget for State and related programs . That proposal , which also has met resistance in Congress , includes plans to whack State \u2019 s educational and cultural programs , its reproductive health initiatives , which affect many women , and its spending on international organizations .\nAlready , Tillerson has made what appear to be permanent changes to State 's top leadership . He has emptied the slots of the department 's deputy secretary for management and its counselor position and has indicated he will not fill those roles .\nTillerson is expected to appoint a policy-focused deputy secretary for the department \u2014 the choice is reported to be GOP attorney John J. Sullivan . But Tillerson has left most of the other leadership slots at State vacant , another reason employees suspect he is pondering serious restructuring .\nThe Democratic Senate aide stressed that it \u2019 s very early days and it \u2019 s not clear where some of the possibilities bandied about presently stand .\nBut some of the changes that have been discussed include streamlining what \u2019 s known at State as the \u201c T \u201d family , which includes bureaus that deal with arms control , political-military affairs and nuclear nonproliferation , the aide said . Another idea floated is bringing the U.S. Agency for International Development entirely under the purview of State , the aide said .\nThe aide also noted that there 's been talk of rejiggering the State Department bureaus devoted to specific regions of the world to be more aligned with the Department of Defense \u2019 s Combatant Commands .\nThis is not a new idea unique to the Trump administration , but it could mean major shifts in which desk officers and deputy assistant secretaries report to which division . For example , South America falls under the Pentagon \u2019 s Southern Command , while Canada and Mexico are under its Northern Command . But at State , the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs includes South America as well as Canada and Mexico .\nSome of the changes , such as making USAID part of State , will likely require authorization from Congress , officials and analysts said . The exact level of congressional involvement will depend in part on whether bureaus or various functions were somehow mandated by legislation .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not reflexively or allergically against changes , \u201d the Democratic Senate aide said . \u201c But exactly what they propose and the logic for it is something that we need to see . \u201d\nVarious stakeholders nearly all mentioned the 2016 report by the Heritage Foundation \u2019 s Brett Schaefer . A former senior State Department official said Trump transition aides were \u201c enamored \u201d of the report and took it into meetings .\nThe report has numerous recommendations , including culling the number of special envoys , eliminating the slot of deputy secretary for management and resources , and bringing USAID under the leadership of an undersecretary of state . It also suggests changes to State \u2019 s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs that include limiting activities that are primarily the responsibility of other U.S. agencies , such as the Treasury Department .\nSchaefer said he talked to a range of people as he prepared his recommendations and found there was a broad consensus that State could be more efficient .\n`` Every administration makes changes , but I suspect there \u2019 s going to be a little bit more along the way of changes under this administration than in previous ones , '' he said .\nEven if every idea the Trump administration proposes doesn \u2019 t become a reality , Schaefer added , it \u2019 s worth simply having the debate . \u201c Ultimately , in the end this is a healthy process , \u201d he said .", "Trump Picks Heather Nauert , Former Fox News Anchor , As U.N . Ambassador\nFrom Fox & Friends to the State Department , and now likely to the United Nations .\nPresident Trump says he will nominate Heather Nauert , the State Department spokeswoman and a former Fox News host , to become the next ambassador to the U.N .\n`` She 's very talented , very smart , very quick , and I think she 's going to be respected by all , so Heather Nauert will be nominated for the ambassador to the United Nations , '' Trump told reporters Friday .\nIf confirmed by the Senate , Nauert will replace Nikki Haley , who is leaving the post at the end of the year .\nNauert was camera-ready when she came to the State Department in April 2017 , having worked at ABC and Fox . She never traveled with and was not close to her first boss at the department , former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . With Mike Pompeo in charge of State , Nauert has been on the road much more .\nYet she faced some criticism for a tourist-like Instagram post from Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , on a trip that was meant to focus on the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .\nThere have been other missteps , including the time when she cited D-Day \u2014 the Allied invasion of Normandy against the Nazis \u2014 as an example of America 's strong relationship with Germany .\nShe has been a strong defender of Trump 's at the podium , something he has clearly noticed .\n`` She 's excellent , she 's been with us a long time , she 's been a supporter for a long time , '' Trump told reporters on Nov. 1 .\nThe State Department used to hold daily briefings . That has been scaled back to two a week , at most .\nNauert , 48 , has been back and forth between her husband and two sons in New York and her job in Washington , D.C .\nBefore joining the Trump administration , she had no government or foreign policy experience , though she did work on some overseas assignments for ABC , including in Baghdad .", "But the American ambassador to the United Nations , Nikki R. Haley , suggested that such a process was doomed as long as Mr. Assad was in power . \u201c We know there \u2019 s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime , \u201d she said on CNN . \u201c If you look at his actions , if you look at the situation , it \u2019 s going to be hard to see a government that \u2019 s peaceful and stable with Assad . \u201d\nThat statement stood in contrast not only to Mr. Tillerson \u2019 s comments but also to Ms. Haley \u2019 s own remarks a week ago \u2014 before Mr. Assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians \u2014 in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the United States .\nStill , the overall tone of suspicion and condemnation of Russia \u2019 s actions in Syria indicated that Mr. Trump \u2019 s top national security advisers were nudging him back to a more traditional Russia policy . During his days as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil , Mr. Tillerson received a friendship award from Mr. Putin , and he is aware of the suspicions surrounding those ties and has gone the furthest in the administration in separating himself from the Russian leader .\nThe challenges have only multiplied in recent days . The Russians , angry about the attack on the air base , have threatened to cut off a communication line that the American and Russian militaries have used to notify each other about air operations in Syria . And the attack has forced Mr. Putin into a tighter relationship with Mr. Assad , perhaps tighter than the Russian leader wants .\nMs. Haley , who , like Mr. Tillerson , is new to diplomacy , has also apparently concluded that a hard line toward Russia is the safest course . The contrast between her remarks and Mr. Trump \u2019 s warm words for Mr. Putin on the campaign trail \u2014 as well as his refusal to acknowledge Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 has been striking .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s Syria policy has been difficult to parse . Mr. Tillerson , in his first television appearances since taking office , seemed to describe two different strategic objectives : halting chemical attacks and ultimately negotiating a cease-fire . But he made it clear that he had no intention of backing a military intervention that would overthrow Mr. Assad . That suggested that as long as the dictator used conventional means to kill his own people \u2014 barrel bombs instead of sarin gas \u2014 the United States would keep its distance .\n\u201c I think what the United States and our allies want to do is to enable the Syrian people to make that determination \u201d about Mr. Assad \u2019 s fate , Mr. Tillerson said on CBS \u2019 s \u201c Face the Nation \u201d \u2014 a line that was often used by his predecessor in the Obama administration , John Kerry . \u201c You know , we \u2019 ve seen what violent regime change looks like in Libya and the kind of chaos that can be unleashed . \u201d", "Newly released internal FBI emails showed the agency 's highest-ranking officials scrambling to answer to Hillary Clinton 's lawyer in the days prior to the 2016 presidential election , on the same day then-FBI Director James Comey sent a bombshell letter to Congress announcing a new review of hundreds of thousands of potentially classified emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner 's laptop .\nThe trove of documents turned over by the FBI , in response to a lawsuit by the transparency group Judicial Watch , also included discussions by former FBI lawyer Lisa Page concerning a potential quid pro quo between the State Department and the FBI -- in which the FBI would agree to effectively hide the fact that a Clinton email was classified in exchange for more legal attache positions that would benefit the FBI abroad , and allow them to send more agents to countries where the FBI 's access is ordinarily restricted .\nThe quid pro quo would have involved the FBI providing some other public reason for withholding the Clinton email from disclosure amid a Freedom of Information Act request , besides its classification level . There are no indications the proposed arrangement ever took place .\nAnd , in the face of mounting criticism aimed at the FBI , the documents revealed that Comey quoted the 19th century poet Ralph Waldo Emerson by assuring his subordinates , `` To be great is to be misunderstood . ''\nThe FBI did not respond to Fox News ' request for comment on the released emails .\nOn Oct. 28 , 2016 , Comey upended the presidential campaign by informing Congress that the FBI would quickly review the Weiner laptop . The Justice Department 's internal watchdog later faulted the FBI for failing to review the Weiner laptop through much of the fall of 2016 , and suggested it was possible that now-fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok may have slow-walked the laptop analysis until other federal prosecutors pressured the FBI to review its contents .\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 28 , Clinton lawyer David Kendall demanded answers from the FBI -- and the agency jumped into action , the emails showed .\nSTRZOK DEMANDED DECLASSIFICATION , OTHER POWERS BEFORE BECOMING NO . 2 ON MUELLER TEAM\nMany of the emails found on the computer were between Clinton and her senior adviser Huma Abedin , Weiner 's now-estranged wife . Despite claims by top FBI officials , including Strzok , several of those emails were determined to contain classified information .\n`` I received the email below from David Kendall and I called him back , '' then-FBI General Counsel James Baker wrote to the agency 's top brass , including Comey , Page and Strzok , in an email . `` Before doing so I alerted DOJ via email that I would do that . ''\nPage and Strzok eventually were revealed to be having an extramarital affair , and Strzok was terminated after a slew of text messages surfaced in which he and Page derided Trump and his supporters using their government-issued phones . Republicans , citing some of those text messages , have accused Strzok and Page of orchestrating a coordinated leak strategy aimed at harming the president .\nGOHMERT UNLOADS ON 'SMIRKING ' STRZOK : 'HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE 'S EYES AND LIE ? '\nAlthough a portion of Kendall 's email was redacted , Baker continued : `` He said that our letter was 'tantalizingly ambiguous ' and made statements that were 'inchoate and highly ominous ' such that what we had done was worse than transparency because it allows people to make whatever they want out of the letter to the prejudice of Secretary Clinton . ... I told him that I could not respond to his requests at this time but that I would discuss it with others and get back to him .\n`` To be great is to be misunderstood . '' \u2014 Fired FBI Director James Comey , quoting Emerson\n`` I suggest that we have some kind of follow up meeting or phone call with this group either this evening or over the weekend to address this and probably other issues/questions that come up in the next 24 hours , '' Baker concluded . `` Sound reasonable ? ''\nDOJ BLAMES SYSTEM-WIDE SOFTWARE FAILURE FOR MISSING STRZOK-PAGE TEXTS ; STRZOK 'S PHONE TOTALLY WIPED\nIn a partially redacted response , Strzok agreed to spearhead a conference call among the FBI 's top officials the next day .\nOn Nov. 6 -- just two days before Election Day -- Comey sent another letter to Congress stating that agents had concluded their review of `` all of the communications '' to or from Clinton while she was secretary of state that appeared on the laptop , and that the review did not change his assessment that Clinton should not be prosecuted .\nIn an email also sent Nov. 6 and unearthed by Judicial Watch , Strzok wrote to the FBI 's leadership : `` [ Redacted ] , Jon and I completed our review of all of the potential HRC work emails on the [ Anthony Weiner ] laptop . We found no previously unknown , potentially classified emails on the media . \u201d\nStrzok added that a team was coming in to `` triple-check '' his methodology and conclusions .\nHowever , at least 18 classified emails sent from Abedin 's account were found by the FBI on the Weiner laptop . And , despite Strzok 's apparent claim , FBI officials later conceded they had not manually screened all of the nearly 700,000 emails on the laptop , but instead used computer technology to prioritize which emails to screen as Election Day rapidly approached .\nON FOUR OCCASIONS , FBI INCORRECTLY ASSURED FISA COURT THAT YAHOO ARTICLE WAS INDEPENDENT REASON TO SURVEIL TRUMP AIDE\n\u201c It is big news that , just days before the presidential election , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s personal lawyer pressured the top lawyer for the FBI on the infamous Weiner laptop emails , \u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement . \u201c These documents further underscore that the fix was in for Hillary Clinton . When will the Justice Department and FBI finally do an honest investigation of the Clinton email scandal ? \u201d\nSeparately , another email from Page , apparently sent in response to a Judicial Watch lawsuit , discussed an apparent attempt by the State Department to pressure the FBI to downgrade the classification level of a Clinton email .\n`` Jason Herring will be providing you with three 302s [ witness reports ] of current and former FBI employees who were interviewed during the course of the Clinton investigation , '' Page wrote . `` These 302s are scheduled to be released to Congress in an unredacted form at the end of the week , and produced ( with redactions ) pursuant to FOIA at the beginning of next week .\nPage continued : `` As you will see , they describe a discussion about potential quid pro quo arrangement between then-DAD in IOD [ deputy assistant director in International Operations Division ] and an Undersecretary at the State Department whereby IOD would get more LEGAT [ legal attach\u00e9 ] positions if the FBI could change the basis of the FOIA withhold re a Clinton email from classified to something else . ''\nFox News has previously reported , citing FBI documents , that a senior State Department official proposed a quid pro quo to convince the FBI to strip the classification on an email from Clinton \u2019 s server \u2013 and repeatedly tried to \u201c influence \u201d the bureau \u2019 s decision when his offer was denied , even taking his plea up the chain of command .\nIn a statement at the time , the FBI acknowleged that an agency official had been in touch with the State Department about overseas positions , but denied that the conversation was tied to the classification of a Clinton email .\n`` Prior to the initiation of the FBI \u2019 s investigation of former Secretary Clinton \u2019 s personal email server , the FBI was asked to review and make classification determinations on FBI emails and information which were being produced by the State Department pursuant to FOIA [ a Freedom of Information Act request ] . The FBI determined that one such email was classified at the Secret level . A senior State Department official requested the FBI re-review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different FOIA exemption , '' the FBI said .\nThe statement continued : `` A now-retired FBI official , who was not part of the subsequent Clinton investigation , told the State Department official that they would look into the matter . Having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior State official , during the same conversation , the FBI official asked the State Department official if they would address a pending , unaddressed FBI request for space for additional FBI employees assigned abroad .\n`` Following the call , the FBI official consulted with a senior FBI executive responsible for determining the classification of the material and determined the email was in fact appropriately classified at the Secret level , '' the FBI 's statement continued . `` The FBI official subsequently told the senior State official that the email was appropriately classified at the Secret level and that the FBI would not change the classification of the email . The classification of the email was not changed , and it remains classified today . Although there was never a quid pro quo , these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review.\u200b ''\nThrough it all , the trove of documents suggested that top to bottom , FBI brass were convinced they were acting appropriately .\nIn response to a press release from Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that criticized the FBI for failing to provide unclassified information on its Clinton probe in a timely and thorough manner to Congress , Comey quoted Emerson 's 1841 essay `` Self Reliance . ''\n`` Outstanding . ... I should have added that I 'm proud of the way we have handled this release [ of unclassified information ] , '' Comey wrote to his subordinates , including Strzok , on Sept. 2 , 2016 . `` Thanks for the work on it . Just another reminder that Emerson was right when he said , 'To be great is to be misunderstood . ' Have a great and quiet weekend . ''\nPage forwarded the email along to her colleagues , including Strzok , and added a smiley face .\nTrump fired Comey in 2017 , leading to Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation after Comey leaked a series of memos he recorded while speaking with Trump privately .\nComey acknowledged in closed-door testimony in December that as of July 2016 , investigators `` did n't know whether we had anything '' implicating Trump in improper Russia collusion , and that `` in fact , when I was fired as director [ in May 2017 ] , I still did n't know whether there was anything to it . ''", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former FBI director James Comey will soon testify in open session before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , following revelations Friday that President Trump told Russian leaders that Comey is a `` nut job '' who was adding pressure to the high-stakes investigation of possible interference in the 2016 election .\nComey , abruptly fired by Trump last week , has agreed to testify in public sometime after Memorial Day , the committee said in a statement .\n\u201c I hope that former Director Comey \u2019 s testimony will help answer some of the questions that have arisen since Director Comey was so suddenly dismissed by the President , '' said Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va. , the committee 's vice chairman . `` I also expect that Director Comey will be able to shed light on issues critical to this Committee \u2019 s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election . Director Comey served his country with honor for many years , and he deserves an opportunity to tell his story . Moreover , the American people deserve an opportunity to hear it . \u201d\nA current White House official has drawn the scrutiny of federal investigators in the widening inquiry into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election , a person familiar with the matter said Friday .\nThe person , who is not authorized to comment publicly , declined to identify the White House official . The development was first reported by the Washington Post .\nThe New York Times reported that Trump told Russian officials that Comey is a `` nut job , '' and that dismissing him meant the pressure of the FBI 's Russia probe has been `` taken off . ''\nWhite House officials did not deny either story , but only stressed that Trump and his staff had no collusion with Russia .\n\u201c As the President has stated before , a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity , '' White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in response to the Post story that a White House official is now ensnared in the probe .\nThe president himself labeled the ongoing FBI probe a `` witch hunt '' this week after the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to oversee it in the wake of Comey 's firing . Earlier this week , revelations that Comey kept memos detailing his conversations with Trump , including one in which the president apparently pressed his former FBI director to drop the inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn , roiled Washington .\nSen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said he hopes Comey 's testimony brings some much-needed clarity .\n\u201c The Committee looks forward to receiving testimony from the former Director on his role in the development of the Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections , and I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media , \u201d Burr said .\nTrump travels to Saudi Arabia as bombshells multiply in Washington\nCalling impeachment talk 'ridiculous , ' Trump denies pressing Comey to drop Michael Flynn investigation\nAs for the conversation with the Russians about Comey , Spicer essentially put the onus on the ex-FBI director .\n`` The President has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria , Ukraine , defeating ISIS and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people , '' Spicer said . `` By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia 's actions , James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia . ''\nSpicer denied that Trump fired Comey to block the Russia investigation , saying , `` the investigation would have always continued , and obviously , the termination of Comey would not have ended it . The real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations . ''\nOn May 10 , the day after he fired Comey , Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and the Russian ambassador to the United States , Sergey I. Kislyak , in a meeting that has generated furious controversy .\nThe Times , citing a report on the meeting a source read to them , said that Trump told the Russians : \u201c I just fired the head of the F.B.I . He was crazy , a real nut job ... I faced great pressure because of Russia . That \u2019 s taken off. \u201d The president also reportedly said : \u201c I \u2019 m not under investigation . \u201d\nThe news said the documents that included the president 's comments were based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office and have been circulated as the official account of the May 10 meeting . The report says one official read quotations to The Times , and a second official confirmed the broad outlines of the discussion . Other news reports also said that , during that same meeting , Trump discussed classified counter-terrorism information with the Russians .\nDemocrats said the new stories underscore their belief that Trump fired Comey in order to shut down the Russia probe . `` If there was any question as to why Comey was really fired , @ realDonaldTrump just answered it . As I said , Nixonian , '' said Sen. Bob Casey , D-Pa .\nCNN reported that at one point during the 2016 campaign , Russian officials bragged in conversations that they had cultivated a strong relationship with Flynn and believed they could use him to influence Donald Trump and his team .\nCiting two unidentified sources , CNN also reported that White House lawyers have begun researching impeachment procedures in an effort to prepare for what officials still believe is a distant possibility that Trump could have to fend off attempts to remove him from office .\nWhite House officials believe the President has the backing of Republican allies in Congress and that impeachment is not in the cards , CNN reported . Even Democrats have tried to calm impeachment talk out of concern it is premature . But lawyers in the White House counsel 's office have consulted experts in impeachment during the past week and have begun collecting information on how such proceedings would work , a person briefed on the matter told CNN .\nTrump 's glibness in private - and even public - statements has apparently caused his staff some consternation . The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump \u2019 s aides have been pressing for more restraint by the president on Twitter , and some weeks ago they organized what one official called an \u201c intervention. \u201d Aides have been concerned about the president \u2019 s use of Twitter to push inflammatory claims , notably his unsubstantiated allegation from March that his Democratic predecessor , Barack Obama , had wiretapped his offices , the Journal reported .\nIn that meeting , aides warned Mr. Trump that certain kinds of comments made on Twitter would \u201c paint him into a corner , \u201d both in terms of political messaging and legally , an unnamed official told the Journal .\nThe top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , D-Md. , called on Republican leaders to obtain the documents related to Trump 's comments to Russian officials about Comey .\n\u201c This new report that President Trump openly admitted to the Russians that he \u2018 faced great pressure \u2019 from the FBI \u2019 s criminal investigation that was \u2018 taken off \u2019 when he fired Director Comey is astonishing \u2014 and extremely troubling , '' Cummings said in a statement .\n`` If these White House documents in fact exist memorializing the President \u2019 s statements to the Russians , the Oversight Committee needs to obtain copies immediately , '' he continued . `` Chairman ( Jason ) Chaffetz should request these White House documents today and have his subpoena pen ready\u2014 just as he did earlier this week with the memos written by Director Comey . \u201d", "Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified Wednesday that he would not have signed a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant renewal for former Trump campaign aide Carter Page had he known about the since-revealed misconduct surrounding those warrants -- while faulting the FBI for its handling of the documents .\nRosenstein confirmed that he signed a FISA warrant renewal application for Page , during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where he was the first witness as part of the panel \u2019 s fresh investigation into the origins of the Russia probe .\n`` If you knew then what you know now , would you have signed the warrant application ? '' committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , asked Rosenstein .\nGRAHAM REQUESTS NAMES OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO 'UNMASK ' TRUMP CAMPAIGN , TRANSITION OFFICIALS\nRosenstein , in his opening statement , defended his own actions related to the FISA warrant , saying that \u201c every application I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged. \u201d Rosenstein implicitly pointed the finger at the FBI for since-revealed problems in that process .\n\u201c The FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified , \u201d Rosenstein said , going on to cite Justice Department inspector general findings last year revealing that the FBI actually \u201c was not following the written protocols , and that \u2018 significant errors \u2019 appeared in applications filed in connection with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation . \u201d\nRosenstein repeatedly claimed to be unaware of details that have since been used by critics to raise questions about the probe . Rosenstein said he `` obviously didn \u2019 t know there was exculpatory evidence '' with regard to the origins of the Russia investigation , including details about Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos .\nRosenstein also noted that \u201c one of the most important matters \u201d during his time at the Justice Department as deputy attorney general was the \u201c investigation of Russian election influence schemes . \u201d\nHe defended his handling of that process , including the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller .\n\u201c Attorney General Sessions had complied with a legal obligation to recuse himself from that investigation , \u201d Rosenstein said , referring to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2019 decision to recuse himself from the probe due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016 . \u201c As a result of events that followed the departure of the FBI Director , I was concerned that the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI Director was not the right person to lead it. \u201d Rosenstein had recommended Trump remove James Comey as director , effectively making his deputy , Andrew McCabe , the leader of the bureau .\n\u201c I decided that appointing a Special Counsel was the best way to complete the investigation appropriately and promote public confidence in its conclusions , \u201d Rosenstein said , noting that the appointment of Mueller was \u201c consistent with Department of Justice precedent . \u201d\nLIST OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO UNMASK FLYNN RELEASED : BIDEN , COMEY , OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF AMONG THEM\n\u201c I asked the Special Counsel to review each criminal allegation the FBI considered relevant to Russian election influence operations and recommended whether to close the matter ; investigate because it might be relevant to Russian election meddling ; or refer the matter to another prosecutor , \u201d Rosenstein explained , noting that he ensured that Mueller had to go through a \u201c supervisory chain of command \u201d with \u201c highly qualified \u201d DOJ attorneys and officials .\n\u201c Crossfire Hurricane \u201d is the FBI \u2019 s internal code name for the bureau \u2019 s original investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign were colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election . That investigation was launched by the FBI in July 2016 . Mueller 's team eventually announced that it found no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination .\nRosenstein also said that \u201c whenever agents or prosecutors make serious mistakes or engage in misconduct , \u201d the DOJ \u201c must take remedial action . \u201d\n\u201c Ensuring the integrity of governmental processes is essential to public confidence in the rule of law , \u201d Rosenstein said .\nRosenstein is the first witness as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2019 s fresh Russia probe review .\nGraham last month outlined the parameters for that investigation , which included , among other things \u201c whether Robert Mueller should have ever been appointed as special counsel . \u201d\nGraham , R-S.C. , during his opening statement Wednesday , acknowledged the importance of allowing Mueller to run his investigation , recalling legislation that he and GOP senators introduced to protect Mueller from firing .\n`` Now it is important to find out what the hell happened , '' Graham said . `` How could it have gotten to be where it wound up being ? ''\nGraham also prompted Rosenstein to acknowledge there was scant collusion evidence in August 2017 .\n`` The whole concept that the campaign was colluding with the Russians , there was no there there in August 2017 . Do you agree with that statement ? '' he asked .\nAugust 2017 is when Rosenstein penned the \u201c scope memo \u201d for Mueller \u2019 s investigation , which outlined the authority of Mueller . Last month , the memo was released in full , and revealed for the first time that Mueller \u2019 s authority went significantly beyond what was previously known .\nPreviously , it had been revealed that in May 2017 , Rosenstein authorized Mueller to probe `` i ) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump ; ii ) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation ; [ and ] iii ) any other matters within the scope of [ obstruction of justice laws ] . \u201d\nBut , Rosenstein 's later August 2017 scope memo had remained largely redacted . The newly released version of the document makes clear that Rosenstein did n't hesitate to authorize a probe into the Trump team that extended beyond general Russian interference efforts .\nDECLASSIFIED SUSAN RICE EMAIL SHOWS COMEY SUGGESTED 'SENSITIVE ' INFO ON RUSSIA NOT BE SHARED WITH FLYNN\nThe newly released version of the 2017 scope memo further makes clear that Mueller could look into whether Michael Flynn `` committed a crime or crimes by engaging in conversations with Russian government officials during the period of the Trump transition . \u201d\nAdditionally , the scope memo stated that Mueller was charged specifically with investigating whether several former Trump officials -- including Carter Page , Papadopoulos and Paul Manafort -- had `` committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government 's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for President of the United States . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Rosenstein \u2019 s appearance comes just one day before the committee votes on potential subpoenas for documents and testimony from top Obama officials .\nDOJ DROPS CASE AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN , IN WAKE OF INTERNAL MEMO RELEASE\nThe potential subpoenas would cover documents , communications and witness testimony in a public setting or behind closed doors for any \u201c current or former executive branch official or employee involved in the 'Crossfire Hurricane ' investigation . \u201d\nGraham is seeking testimony from former FBI Director James Comey , former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , former CIA Director John Brennan , former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and others .\nGraham announced earlier that his investigation would specifically focus on unmasking and abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . It comes amid swirling controversies surrounding the unmasking of Flynn 's name in intelligence reports , as well as the DOJ 's effort to drop the Flynn case citing problems with the FBI 's handling of it .", "Republicans finally got their chance Thursday to publicly question senior FBI agent Peter Strzok about his politically charged text messages with Lisa Page , a former FBI attorney he was personally involved with . It did not go exactly as the lawmakers hoped .\nIf the House GOP \u2019 s goal in grilling Strzok at length was to distract from the ongoing investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia and the president \u2019 s conspicuously pro-Kremlin behavior\u2014including his recent suggestions that the US might withdraw from NATO\u2014then Thursday \u2019 s hearing was a success . But the showdown also cost Republicans : They were forced to let Strzok openly defend himself for the first time . And their own eagerness to continue a purely partisan attack on special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation was on glaring display .\nAt the joint hearing of the House Judiciary and the Oversight and Government Reform committees , GOP members mostly spent their time leveling accusations of extreme bias against Strzok , who played a key role in the bureau \u2019 s investigations into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of a email and allegations that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia . They read aloud Strzok \u2019 s text messages to Page , and forced him to read some aloud too . But those texts have long been public and widely discussed in the media . What was new Wednesday was that Strzok had the chance to explain them , and he made the most of it .\nStrzok was able to explain why he sent the famous text in which he told Page that \u201c we \u2019 ll stop \u201d Trump from becoming president . He said the text was a response to events that included \u201c Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero , and my presumption based on that horrible , disgusting behavior that the American people would not elect someone demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States. \u201d ( Strzok was referring to Trump \u2019 s attacks on Khizr Khan , who famously criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 ; his son , Captain Humayun Khan , was killed in Iraq in 2004 . )\nStrzok continued : \u201c I can assure you , Mr. Chairman , that at no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took . He added that the committee did not need to rely on his word , due the multiple layers agents involved in investigative decisions . \u201c They would not tolerate any improper behavior in me any more than I would tolerate it in them , \u201d he said . \u201c That is who we are as the FBI . \u201d\nStrozk also told the panels that the \u201c we \u201d he \u2019 d referred to in the text about \u201c stopping \u201d Trump was not the FBI , as Republicans have asserted , but American voters . His forceful remarks did not appease his critics , but they served to deflate the anti-Trump partisan narrative about him that his critics constructed over months while he remained silent . His statement in defense of himself and the FBI drew applause from some hearing attendees .\nStrzok had used his opening statement at the hearing to make an obvious but overlooked point : If he wanted to \u201c stop \u201d Trump \u2019 s election , he could have leaked information on the Trump campaign \u2019 s extensive contacts with Russia . But \u201c the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind , \u201d Strzok said . That made for an interesting contrast : As Democratic lawmakers noted , senior FBI officials in 2016 believed that agents in the FBI \u2019 s New York bureau were leaking information intended to damage Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign . The Justice Department \u2019 s Inspector General concluded this year that concerns about leaks from that FBI field office influenced former FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s possibly fateful decision to make public that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails just ahead of Election Day .\nStrzok , citing advice from FBI lawyers , declined to detail his work on the Trump-Russia investigation . But he managed to highlight the significance of the Trump campaign \u2019 s alleged actions . \u201c If there were people within the campaign who were colluding or working with the government of Russia , then there is very little that is more important for \u2026 the FBI [ to ] get to the bottom of , \u201d he said . Strozk also expressed concern that Russia succeeded in influencing the outcome of the 2016 election by \u201c putting their finger on the scale \u201d of American public opinion .\nDemocrats used the hearing to highlight Republican efforts to hinder the investigation into Trump . When Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt of Congress for failing to answer some questions about the Russia probe , Democrats responded by forcing a joint committee vote aimed at subpoenaing former White House advisor Steve Bannon , who earlier this year refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee . Republicans voted down that effort . Notably , Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-SC ) appeared less than eager on this front : He said \u201c pass \u201d during the roll call vote .\nDemocrats also used the hearing to point out that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte and Gowdy previously justified their refusal to look into Trump \u2019 s ties to Russia by asserting they wanted to avoid interfering with Mueller \u2019 s investigation .\nRep. Jerry Nadler ( D-NY ) , the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , noted that Goodlatte said last year that \u201c until Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation is complete , it is redundant for the House of Representatives to engage in fact-gathering on many of the same issues. \u201d Goodlatte has also claimed that his committee \u201c would never intrude on an active criminal investigation , \u201d Nadler pointed out . But Nadler said that was belied by the fact that the Republicans , during an 11-hour private interview earlier in the week , asked Strzok more than 200 questions about the special counsel \u2019 s investigation , including about the FBI \u2019 s use of confidential sources .\n\u201c Are we no longer going to wait until special counsel Mueller concludes his work , Mr. Chairman ? \u201d Nadler asked , adding : \u201c Or perhaps the rules of this joint investigation , such as they are , operate differently now that we are approaching the midterm elections and special counsel Mueller is closing in on the President \u2019 s close associates . \u201d", "The minute that self-appointed militiamen stepped onto the property of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , liberals started worrying that these folks would not be held accountable for their criminal behavior . The group , led by the two sons of right wing radical Cliven Bundy , took over the refuge , demanding that the taxpayers turn over federal lands so that folks like the Bundys and other farmers , miners and other private interests could profit handsomely off the land without having to pay for it . It 's clear that the militiamen expected the feds to rush the compound , causing a firefight in which they could be martyrs for the right wing cause of giving white conservatives a lot of free money while leaving the rest of us out to dry .\nBut that did n't happen . Instead , the federal government seemingly did n't do anything for many weeks , letting these guys get comfortable at the refuge and even go back and forth from it for grocery-shopping , media events , and whatever else their hearts desired . Only one occupier was arrested , for using a stolen vehicle to drive to the store .\nThis lack of interest in having a big ol ' shootout right away on government property did n't just disappoint the militiamen . A number of liberal commentators were miffed that the feds seemed to be twiddling their thumbs , often arguing that if the occupiers were people of color , the shootout would have happened already . The criticism had some merit , of course , but the solution for such a double standard is n't to have more shootouts , so much as it 's an argument against the quick-to-violence reactions law enforcement regrettably has when dealing with non-white suspects .\nThe occupation was expensive and disruptive , of course , leading the Democratic governor of Oregon to ask for the feds to step in . This only reinforced liberal suspicions that the feds were blowing this off and were not going to hold these yahoos accountable for their actions .\nWell , those fears were proven most dramatically wrong Tuesday afternoon , when law enforcement confronted the militiamen on the open highway . A shootout did ensue , which was expected since these folks all have ridiculous martyr fantasies , and one person was killed . So far , there have been eight arrests , and the leaders of this fiasco are in custody . Now the feds have closed in on the refuge , closing roads and access . Without leadership or access to the outside , it wo n't be surprising if the rest of the people inside just give up soon enough .\nThe worrywarts were getting all worked up over nothing . Despite all the hand-wringing over whether the feds were taking this seriously enough , in the end , it turns out that the feds were right and the worrywarts were wrong . Waiting this out a bit , while unfortunately disruptive to the area , ended up being a far more sensible way of dealing with this than trying to raid the wildlife refuge .\nRaiding the refuge was always a bad idea . For one thing it would give these wannabe martyrs exactly what they want , an opportunity to get hurt or die at government hands and become fuel for radical right wing propaganda . They even brought children onto the property to raise the stakes . In the past , federal raids under similar circumstances involving children -- -most notably in Waco -- -not only resulted in innocent lives being lost , but in providing right wing radicals even more justification to demonize federal authorities .\nAnd while the occupation was disruptive and expensive , it would have been far more costly to give the militia the shootout at the refuge they wanted . These guys bragged about how they anticipated violence . They openly threatened that this would become another Waco . Rushing them at the compound would have caused expensive damage to the building , and possibly a fire if the militiamen made good on these threats . Repairing that would have cost a fortune and kept the refuge employees on leave even longer .\nInstead , the feds let the militia get complacent and bored . They let the media attention drift away , forcing the militia to have to take more risks and leave the refuge more to get attention . What looked like federal inattention now looks a whole lot more like it was a trap being set to draw the militia members out .\nIf so , it worked perfectly . The militia members felt emboldened enough to travel 100 miles away from the refuge , and it was out there , without the shelter of the refuge , the presence of cameras , or the ability to use children or neighbors as human shields , that they were finally nabbed by law enforcement . No expensive destruction of property , no dead kids , no officers killed . Only one would-be martyr lost his life .\nBut this was n't just a success from a damage control perspective , either . The federal strategy also kneecapped the propaganda value of this occupation . As I wrote earlier this month , the lengthy occupation gave the militiamen near-daily opportunities to show the world their true colors , proving that they are n't manly warriors taking a stand so much as a bunch of clowns playing dress-up .\nThe arrest is more of the same . Instead of staging some Alamo-inspired last stand in the refuge , they apprehended in the middle of nowhere because they were stupid enough to go on a road trip . The only way this could have been more demoralizing for their cause is if they were wearing adult diapers when they got caught .\nThe entire debacle is n't quite over yet . There are still some militia members holed up in the refuge . But their leaders have all been apprehended . Considering what idiots the leaders were , it 's not unreasonable to think the people who were left to hold down the fort are even less capable of managing this situation . The federal strategy of being patient and waiting for an opportunity will most likely continue to pay off .\nInstead of being angry that the feds did n't rush this compound , liberals should use this story to push for smarter , less aggressive policing generally . We 're in the midst , prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement , of a nationwide discussion about the dangers of the `` shoot first '' philosophy of policing . This story if a perfect example of why it 's better for police to be patient and focused on minimizing damage rather than trying to strong-arm the suspects in every situation . It 's not just the right thing to do , but it 's often the most effective way to get the bad guys without hurting innocent people in the process .", "In a single moment , the Orlando shooting brought together three of the most contentious issues in the United States .\nWithin 12 hours of the attack , President Obama disparaged lax gun laws , Donald Trump tweeted about radical Islamic terrorism , and gay and lesbian celebrities decried a hate crime that took the lives of 49 people at a popular gay nightclub .\nIn the days since the attack , it has become increasingly clear that the actions of Omar Mateen did not fit into a single category of hate crime , mass shooting , or jihadist terror .\n\u201c I would call it a hate crime . I would call it terrorism . It \u2019 s both , \u201d said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Ronald Hopper on Wednesday .\nThe question for federal officials now is : How should they respond ?\nOrlando is further evidence that the nature of terrorism in the US is changing , making the job of federal investigators harder .\nThe Islamic State , in particular , is less concerned with strategic goals than simply spreading fear as widely as possible . It preys on any disgruntled Muslim angry enough to pick up a gun .\nIt doesn \u2019 t require them to go to Syria for training . It doesn \u2019 t require them to talk to jihadists online for instructions . It doesn \u2019 t require them even to know how to build bombs ; guns will suffice .\nFederal agencies are coping with this evolving threat . But the fact that Mateen was investigated twice by the FBI but not stopped speaks to vulnerabilities . Without more resources to cope with an exploding caseload , federal agencies will be hard-pressed to do more .\nFor this reason , the ultimate solution lies in fixing the issues in American society that are giving rise to lone wolf terrorists , some say .\nThere have been signs this was coming . \u201c The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here , to worrying about people in the United States , \u201d said then-Attorney General Eric Holder to ABC News in 2010 . \u201c You didn \u2019 t worry about this even two years ago \u2013 about individuals , about Americans , to the extent that we now do . \u201d\nWhat 's made the issue much more urgent is the rise of Islamic State and its approach to terrorism . While Al Qaeda aimed at winning the hearts and minds of Muslims , the Islamic State is determined to scare them \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 into submission .\n\u201c Most people , al-Qaeda \u2019 s leaders among them , can \u2019 t imagine that political success could come from enraging the masses rather than charming them , \u201d wrote William McCants , a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , in a Politico article last year .\nSince the goal is pure terror , there 's no need for spectacular , highly planned attacks like 9/11 . Any act of mass violence will do . Proper training is no longer a must , only the will to commit violence .\n\u201c The biggest change in terrorism since 9/11 is the jihadists \u2019 embrace of mass shootings , \u201d Mr. McCants writes in an e-mail . \u201c They , like many other terrorists , used to be fixated on building bombs . But they \u2019 ve learned that mass shootings are easier to organize without detection and generate just as much media attention . ISIS has been exceptionally good at inspiring young men to carry out these attacks in its name . \u201d\nMateen , an American citizen born to Afghan parents in New York , offers a picture of the difficulties in sniffing out such terrorists .\nThe FBI put him on a watch list in May 2013 after he made comments to coworkers claiming he had family and friends affiliated with Hezbollah and Al Qaeda . ( That seemed unlikely since the two groups are enemies . )\nAgents interviewed him twice before closing the investigation in March 2014 with too little evidence , according to FBI Director James Comey .\nMateen again came to their attention shortly afterward when the agency found he attended the same mosque as a Syrian suicide bomber . Again , the investigation was closed when the agency found \u201c no ties of consequence , \u201d according to Director Comey .\nSo , two years later , when Mateen walked into the St. Lucie ( Fla. ) Shooting Center to purchase a semiautomatic rifle and pistol , it raised no flags . He had the valid licenses . He passed the background check .\nThe owner of a different local gun store , however , says that his employees refused to sell Mateen body armor and bulk ammunition after he began asking `` suspicious '' questions , according to ABC News . Robert Abell of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach , Fla. , says he contacted authorities about Mateen before the massacre ; the FBI did not respond to ABC News 's request for comment .\nIn its defense , the FBI notes that it is already stepping up antiterror efforts . As of last fall , there were some 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers who live in the United States , according to the report from George Washington University \u2019 s Program on Extremism . Last year , officials arrested 56 of them , the highest number of terror-related arrests in any year since the 9/11 terror attacks .\nYet the FBI has to walk a fine line , says Seamus Hughes , deputy director of the program and coauthor of the report . The FBI investigates thousands of potential domestic terrorists at any given time , the vast majority of whom never plan a terrorist act .\nFrances Townsend , who served as Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush , worries that the current guidelines for domestic counterterror investigations may constrain investigators . Specifically , she says they harm agents \u2019 ability to include social media activity and postings in their investigations .\n\u201c We have to make sure we don \u2019 t let the attorney general \u2019 s guidelines become what \u2018 the wall \u2019 was to 9/11 , \u201d said Ms. Townsend , referring to the firewall preventing the sharing of information among intelligence agencies that existed before the 9/11 terrorist attacks .\nBut even if everything works , there \u2019 s an element of guesswork in figuring out who will move from being a mere sympathizer to taking up arms . \u201c In most cases the motivations are complicated , \u201d says Mr. Hughes at George Washington University . \u201c People are complex and they do things for a variety of reasons . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s certainly true for Mateen , who proclaimed allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the shooting and often angrily denounced gays to friends and family , but also frequently attended the gay nightclub he attacked , according to reports .\nAddressing the rising lone wolf threat isn \u2019 t just a matter of what can and can \u2019 t be done in an investigation but will almost certainly entail additional resources , said Ms. Townsend .\n\u201c The question is , if we want the FBI to cover more threats , do we give the FBI more resources , more agents ? \u201d she asked in a conference call with reporters Monday .\nOthers suggest that the answers could lie beyond law enforcement alone .\nMany lone wolf terrorists are driven to suicide for the same reasons that ordinary people are , as they try to cope with depression and marital strife , argues Adam Lankford , a University of Alabama criminology professor and author of a 2013 book , \u201c The Myth of Martyrdom . \u201d\n\u201c The Orlando shooter and many mass shooters fall within this demographic and seek to die , even when they claim to be \u2018 martyrs \u2019 or attempt to hide their psychological pain , \u201d says Mr. Lankford , via e-mail . \u201c If we can make major progress on reducing suicides and helping people with suicidal thoughts , that would be an incredibly important step for America , and I believe a side effect would be a reduction in mass shootings . \u201d\nAnother option is a comprehensive preventative approach to radicalization , argues Hughes of George Washington University . \u201c You have a number of cases where there \u2019 s not enough evidence to prosecute , but the FBI is still concerned about the individual . \u201d\nThat would mean targeted intervention from other groups than law enforcement . For example , the World Organization for Resource Development and Education has developed an innovative program in Maryland 's Montgomery County that aims to empower community members to intervene with vulnerable youth before they choose a path of violence .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThe model could spread to other jurisdictions . It 's better that it 's a local rather than federal government solution , Hughes says , reducing the footprint of government intervention . At the federal level , too , he is confident Congress can push beyond partisan divisions to come up with ways to reduce lone-wolf terrorism .\n\u201c You tend to see a coalescing of congressional and other leaders to search for solutions \u201d after events such as the Orlando shooting , Hughes says . \u201c I am ever the optimist .... I think there \u2019 s always going to be a reevaluation . \u201d", "Senate liberals know they are going to lose the battle over fast-track trade authority . But they \u2019 re doing all they can to prolong the fight \u2014 perhaps even past the Memorial Day recess into June \u2014 in hopes that a long delay will damage the bill \u2019 s already difficult prospects in the House .\nA coalition of Senate Democrats who \u2019 ve long opposed new trade agreements , led by Sherrod Brown of Ohio , say they are planning to throw up procedural roadblocks and offer amendments that would expand worker protections and undermine GOP support for the fast-track measure . While they can \u2019 t win the battle , Brown and his allies hope their resistance will stoke popular sentiment against the bill and encourage Democrats to vote against it in the House , where Republican leaders warn they still need about 20 more votes for approval .\n\u201c The handwriting \u2019 s on the wall , \u201d Brown said of the prospects of beating the bill in the Senate . But , he said : \u201c There \u2019 s real opportunity in the House to defeat it . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to work as hard as we can to defeat this legislation , \u201d added Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) in an interview Thursday . \u201c Time is on our side . The longer we keep it on the floor , the more the American people understand what a disastrous agreement this is , the better it is for us . \u201d\nSenate rules will work in their favor , given that any single member can drag out debate for days by objecting to time and amendment agreements . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s promise to have an open amendment process will also help liberals , as they mull offering amendments on currency manipulation and additional worker protections that could be tough for vulnerable Republicans to oppose . And lawmakers need to deal with the expiring PATRIOT Act next week , along with transportation law , putting the squeeze on the Senate \u2019 s tight schedule .\nThe White House and Senate Republicans are pressing the pace to keep momentum on their side after they broke a filibuster this week . Fast-track Trade Promotion Authority is the centerpiece of President Barack Obama \u2019 s economic agenda , and it is necessary if he wants to speed a huge trade pact with 12 Pacific Rim nations through Congress without amendment .\nRepublicans even tried to schedule a rare Friday Senate session to begin debating amendments , an effort that proved unsuccessful . The GOP is already blaming Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) for delaying votes and debate on the bill .\nMeanwhile , liberal Democrats huddled this week with Brown to plot the measure \u2019 s defeat and are continuing to formulate a plan of attack . They remain tight-lipped about what exactly they will do to jam up McConnell \u2019 s priorities , but they \u2019 ve promised to make it an ugly skirmish .\n\u201c The procedural tools will come out , \u201d warned Sen. Brian Schatz ( D-Hawaii ) .\nThe time crunch is going to work against McConnell . Dealing with the high-stakes trade measure and a controversial extension of surveillance programs at the same time is going to be difficult , if not impossible . When push comes to shove , Republicans may be forced to punt trade until after the recess to deal with the more pressing PATRIOT Act .\n\u201c Sen . McConnell has written more checks than he can cash on the schedule , \u201d said Adam Jentleson , a spokesman for Reid . \u201c Something \u2019 s got ta give , it \u2019 s just not clear what . \u201d\nMcConnell ( R-Ky. ) shrugged off the pessimism . \u201c We will finish it next week , \u201d he said of TPA on Thursday afternoon .\n\u201c We \u2019 re running out of time , \u201d added McConnell \u2019 s whip , Sen. John Cornyn of Texas . \u201c My goal is to finish it next week . I \u2019 m an optimist . \u201d\nBut Republicans are already preparing for the worst . Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) said in an interview that if he had his way , the Senate would stay in through the recess to finish his bill . That \u2019 s highly unlikely given that four senators are already running for president ; and the Senate barely works on Fridays anymore .\n\u201c Anything beyond next week is obstructionism , \u201d Hatch said of Democrats \u2019 threats to hold up the bill . This week \u2019 s filibuster , he added , smacked of a Democratic strategy \u201c so that they can claim that they don \u2019 t have enough time to bring up amendments . \u201d\nPotentially problematic amendments began piling up as soon as the Senate voted to begin debate on the bill . Brown wants to crank up spending on the Trade Adjustment Assistance program , which could appeal to several Rust Belt Republicans looking to assure their constituents that any job losses from new trade bills will be blunted by the TAA program .\n\u201c If McConnell wants to keep us in , late nights and all , I \u2019 m fine , \u201d Brown said . \u201c I want to make sure we get these amendments out there . \u201d\nRepublicans already have begrudgingly agreed to move a trade assistance measure along with the fast-track bill , but expanding the TAA protections even further could erode GOP support for the fast-track measure it \u2019 s paired with .\nRepublicans have offered an amendment to strip the bill of the trade-assistance program , which likely would fail if it gets a vote but serves as a direct challenge to Brown .\n\u201c If they want to defeat it , they might be able to defeat it with some amendments that just make it improbable to use , \u201d Hatch said of fast-track .\nSen. James Lankford ( R-Okla. ) wants the Senate to attach a provision that would require that religious liberty be factored into any new trade deals , injecting a social issues debate into an already fraught battle over economics and prosperity . He and Brown will get votes on their proposals on Monday evening .\nAnd Sens . Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) and Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) have offered amendments aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration . Cruz says he won \u2019 t support anything that doesn \u2019 t include his amendment .\n\u201c We should put it in writing and make it binding law . I am a strong supporter of free trade , but I can not support legislation that would allow the president to once again circumvent Congress to enact his own immigration laws , \u201d Cruz said .\nDemocrats say that even if McConnell moves to block or limit the amendment jockeying early next week , their liberal members are likely to object to swift consideration of the fast-track bill . That could drag out the bill until the end of the week , which would then crash into the McConnell \u2019 s efforts to extend portions of the PATRIOT Act .\nRepublicans privately complained that Reid was playing both sides by working to delay the bill and block amendments , only to then complain about not getting votes on Democratic amendments .\nLiberals and libertarians are vowing to fight McConnell \u2019 s effort to offer a clean extension of current surveillance law , including the bulk data-collection program , meaning the Senate may have to devote significant time to that , too .\nIn the middle of it all is Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , Hatch \u2019 s primary dance partner on trade issues . And though he said in an interview he \u2019 s doing everything he can to move the trade bill before the recess , he \u2019 s also vowed to filibuster any effort to extend the PATRIOT Act without reforms to bulk data collection .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to pull out all the stops to do both , \u201d Wyden said .", "Democratic congressional leaders are loath to acknowledge it , but President Trump has them cornered with his threat to terminate NAFTA if his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada isn \u2019 t approved .\nScrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement without a replacement would deliver a heavy blow to the U.S. economy . In the short term , it would reduce real U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 by as much as $ 231 billion , more than 1 percent during the first five years , according to an analysis commissioned by the Business Roundtable .\n\u201c Terminating NAFTA would have negative impacts on jobs , exports and output even after new supply chains are formed . In this longer run , we estimate that U.S. GDP would remain depressed by over 0.2 percent , permanently , \u201d said the report for the Business Roundtable , an association of chief executive officers from major U.S. corporations .\nThe impact on the U.S. GDP , about $ 19.3 trillion in 2017 , would depend on the reactions of Mexico and Canada . Alternative scenarios in the analysis pegged the reduced annual GDP at $ 119 billion to $ 231 billion , with job losses from 1.8 million to 3.6 million in the five-year window .\nSen. Charles E. Grassley , the Iowa Republican who next year will take charge of the Senate Finance Committee , which oversees trade agreements , said the president has Congress over a barrel .\n\u201c It seems to me it is going to force Congress to act \u2014 even if you disagree with parts of it , \u201d he said in an interview on the \u201c Adams on Agriculture \u201d program on the American Ag Radio Network .\n\u201c Now that is a hard-nosed approach , but sometimes a president has to use that if he wants to get things accomplished , \u201d Mr. Grassley said .\nCapitol Hill Democrats shrugged off Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat and vowed to tinker with the proposed U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement ( USMCA ) , potentially derailing a deal that legislatures in all three countries must approve .\nMr. Trump and his counterparts in Mexico and Canada signed the agreement on Nov. 30 , capping a year of intense negotiations that produced a trade deal that many said would be impossible to make .\nTwo days after signing the accord in Buenos Aires while the three leaders were attending the Group of 20 summit , Mr. Trump put Congress on notice .\n\u201c I will be formally terminating NAFTA shortly , \u201d he told reporters on the Air Force One flight back to Washington . \u201c Then Congress will have a choice of approving the USMCA , which is a phenomenal deal . Much , much better than NAFTA . A great deal . \u201d\nThe president threatened to rip up NAFTA , which he called the \u201c worst trade deal ever made. \u201d The threat helped force Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table .\nMr. Trump has found more agreement with Democrats than his fellow Republicans in criticizing the 24-year-old NAFTA , which is blamed for shipping jobs to Mexico and hastening the demise of U.S. manufacturing .\nBut Democrats , who take control of the House next month , have been less than enthusiastic about approving an agreement that would allow Mr. Trump to check off a major campaign promise .\nThe USMCA sets new rules on agriculture , technology and auto imports , protects autoworkers \u2019 jobs in the U.S. and opens Canada to American dairy products .\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , the California Democrat who is poised to become speaker of the House , described the new pact as a warmed-over NAFTA that doesn \u2019 t go far enough .\nShe joked that it was \u201c the bill formerly known as Prince , \u201d a reference to the late musician who once changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol .\nMrs. Pelosi said Democrats will fight for measures to accompany USMCA that enforce labor and environmental requirements , as well as legislation in Mexico to address wages and working conditions .\n\u201c I said it was a work in progress , \u201d she said . \u201c I know it \u2019 s work ; I hope it \u2019 s progress . \u201d\nRep. Bill Pascrell Jr. of New Jersey , the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee \u2019 s trade panel , said he doesn \u2019 t believe Mr. Trump would carry out the threat .\n\u201c He \u2019 s not someone I take at his word . Trump boasted about what a great deal the USMCA was , yet a day after signing is resorting to threats to force Congress \u2018 hand , \u201d he said . \u201c This doesn \u2019 t display confidence in the deal he made . I have more confidence in Congress continuing to work with [ U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer ] than it would seem Trump does . \u201d\n\u201c Continuing the status quo of NAFTA is not an option . Too many jobs have been outsourced and wages lost to let the old agreement stand , \u201d he said . \u201c But simply withdrawing won \u2019 t do anything to raise wages here or in Mexico or reverse NAFTA \u2019 s destruction . \u201d\nMr. Trump has the authority to terminate the deal under NAFTA \u2019 s Article 2205 , which is the exit clause for member countries . Invoking it would begin a six-month waiting period before Mr. Trump could quit the deal .\nInvoking Article 2205 would impose a six-month deadline on Congress to approve USMCA or revert to trade laws that were in effect in 1993 before NAFTA .\nCongress might test Mr. Trump \u2019 s resolve , but the president has insisted that the U.S. would be just fine without NAFTA .", "As the president \u2019 s trade agenda approaches reality this week , misconceptions about it abound \u2013 partly because the noisy arguments for and against it have obscured the issue , and partly because of the emotionalism that trade stirs up .\nThe trade debate is a combination of both factual information about what \u2019 s actually in the legislation and of emotions about job loss , says Gary Chaison , a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester , Ma .\n\u201c Trade agreements are always difficult because they are very emotional things , \u201d he says . They invariably benefit some people and negatively affect others . \u201c For the winners we look at the facts , and for the losers we look at emotions . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , the Senate passed `` fast track , '' which prevents Congress from amending trade bills negotiated by President Obama , by a 60-to-38 vote . That now goes to Mr. Obama 's desk for a signature . It also approved assistance for workers displaced by global trade . That goes back to the House for final approval .\nWith all that in mind , here are five common misconceptions about free trade agreements and the president \u2019 s trade agenda .\nFiguring job losses and gains from trade is not an exact science .\nOpponents argue vigorously that trade deals such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) are job killers and wage suppressors , while proponents argue they lead to economic growth .\nBut in April , the independent Congressional Research Service reported that \u201c the overall economic impact of NAFTA is difficult to measure \u201d because trade and investment are influenced by many variables . \u201c NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters , \u201d it concluded .\nPredicting losses or gains from the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 the historic trade deal that the US is negotiating with 11 other Pacific Rim nations \u2013 is even harder because it involves so many countries , says Steve Bell , senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank in Washington .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c virtually impossible to estimate with any reliability the job impact or the cost impact or the [ economic ] impact . People who say that are pretty much making that stuff up , \u201d he says .\nFor that reason , he and others argue , trade deals should be judged on whether they expand America \u2019 s positive influence in the world , whether they break down export barriers to US goods , and whether they improve labor , environmental , and human rights standards abroad .\nProfessor Chaison argues they must be accompanied by assistance for displaced American workers , because \u201c we don \u2019 t fully appreciate \u201d the radical way in which real people \u2019 s lives can be harmed by trade .\nChina is not part of the Pacific trade agreement , or any US trade deal .\nLawmakers and labor often point to jobs lost to a China trade deal . For example , Rep. Barbara Lee ( D ) of California recently said that communities of color have disproportionately suffered because of a \u201c US-China trade deal . \u201d\nYes , minorities have disproportionately suffered job losses over the years , but the way it 's described makes it sound like the losses come from America 's trade agreement with China . There is no US-China trade deal .\nRepresentative Lee is getting her data \u2013 35 percent of minority jobs lost to China along with a 30 percent drop in wages \u2013 from the Communications Workers of America . The union cites \u201c the China deal , \u201d but what it \u2019 s really referring to is China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 .\nBeing in the WTO is not the same as entering into a negotiated free trade agreement , which could be potentially stricter , between two countries or even a dozen countries . Some argue that China should be part of the Pacific Rim deal or some future US free trade agreement because it \u2019 s too big to ignore .\nBut for now , the Obama administration is arguing that the Pacific agreement is needed as a geostrategic counterweight to China .\nGlobalization and free trade deals are not the same thing .\nWhen opponents of free trade agreements cite job losses , lower wages , or outsourcing , they often lump in the phenomenon of \u201c globalization \u201d with free trade agreements .\nGlobalization is what \u2019 s happening with the world economy and culture \u2013 the spread of interconnectedness hastened by the digital age . Its downside can mean Americans losing business to international retailers over the Internet , losing call centers to India ( with which the US has no trade agreement ) , or being undercut by Chinese currency manipulation .\nFree trade agreements try to bring structure to this free-wheeling world by setting up common standards . They , too , have downsides that result in job losses in some sectors , but the deals are an attempt to bring order to globalization .\n\u201c Globalization is an economic evolution . A trade agreement is just the opposite . It \u2019 s a construct , \u201d says Bell .\nThe secrecy surrounding the Pacific trade deal is not so unusual .\nIt \u2019 s true that members of Congress have to go to a special room to read the draft Pacific trade agreement ; that they must surrender their cell phones before going in ; that they can take notes \u2013 but not with them when they leave ; that they may not divulge its contents to outsiders , even experts who might help them better understand the contents .\nWhy the secrecy ? The administration says it \u2019 s to protect its negotiating power . How can it negotiate sensitive points with 11 countries while 535 members of Congress and the general public weigh in ? Besides , any member of Congress will be able to go to the trade negotiations or consult with the administration . And the final deal will be available to the public for 60 days before it \u2019 s voted on in Congress .\nDeal-making in secret is not an unusual negotiating strategy , supporters say .\n\u201c This is really not substantially different than how labor unions themselves negotiate their contracts , \u201d says Rep. Gregory Meeks ( D ) of New York , one of the president \u2019 s few Democratic trade supporters in the House . For example , top union officials negotiate contracts , and then take the results back to the members for ratification .\nOn Wednesday , the Senate approved fast track trading authority for the president .\nBut this was a vote about process , not a vote on a trade agreement . Fast track allows the president to negotiate a trade deal with the assurance that Congress can \u2019 t change it once he \u2019 s sealed the deal ; it can only approve or disapprove it . The actual vote on a trade deal would come only after it \u2019 s finalized .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThis week \u2019 s votes also include assistance to help workers displaced by global trade . Republicans generally view such aid as welfare , but it \u2019 s the price that Democrats , including the president , are demanding because trade deals inevitably displace some workers ( see point No . 1 ) .\nAfter a difficult journey through Congress , both fast track and help for displaced workers are expected to reach the president for signature by the end of this week .", "Abe to Congress : Japan wo n't shy away from reforms needed for trade pact\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country will not shy away from domestic reforms vital for its participation in a massive Asia-Pacific trade deal Tokyo is trying to close with the U.S. and other Asia-Pacific countries .\n\u201c Japan \u2019 s agriculture is at a crossroads , \u201d Abe said in his historic address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday , the first by a Japanese prime minister . \u201c In order for it to survive , it has to change now . \u201d\nThe U.S. is pressing Tokyo to open access to a number of so-called sacred sectors , such as rice , dairy , beef and pork , through the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks . Japan has been cautious in meeting those demands , and Abe \u2019 s ruling Liberal Democratic Party is seen as tightly under the grip of the country \u2019 s powerful agriculture lobby .\nThe Japanese leader , however , said he is bringing \u201c great reforms \u201d to agricultural policy , noting that the average Japanese farmer is older than 66 and Japanese farming is shrinking as a percentage of the country \u2019 s economy .\nAbe also said he is committed to overhauling regulations in medicine , energy and other areas .\n\u201c Please do come and see the new Japan , where we have regained our spirit of reform and our sense of speed , \u201d he said . \u201c Japan will not run away from any reforms . \u201d\nThe prime minister has sought to turn around Japan \u2019 s stagnant economy through his \u201c Abenomics \u201d plan , which rests on regulatory reforms and participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal . The \u201c goal is near \u201d in the U.S. and Japan \u2019 s talks on agriculture and auto trade issues important for the success of the broader Asia-Pacific pact , he said .\n\u201c Let us bring the TPP to a successful conclusion through our joint leadership , \u201d he said . U.S. lawmakers are currently considering trade promotion authority legislation considered vital to closing the trade deal and expediting its passage in Congress .\nAbe also stressed the strategic importance of the trade deal , highlighting its role in spreading the shared values of rule of law and democracy in the region .\n\u201c We must take the lead to build a market that is fair , dynamic , sustainable and is also free from the arbitrary intentions of any nation , \u201d he said , an apparent reference to China \u2019 s growing dominance in the region .\n\u201c In the Pacific market , we can not overlook sweatshops or burdens on the environment , \u201d he said . \u201c Nor can we simply allow free riders on intellectual property . \u201d\nAbe \u2019 s trip to Washington this week also focused on strengthening security ties with the U.S. through new defense cooperation guidelines .\nIn a meeting with President Barack Obama on Tuesday , Abe said the two leaders fully agreed on the significance of the new defense policy .\nThe reforms , which will be fully implemented by this summer , will give the East Asian country more leeway to deploy its military forces to intervene in foreign conflicts and move away from constitutional self-defense restrictions .\nJapan is keen to expand its military operations to counter China \u2019 s claims over a group of islands in the East China Sea and respond to North Korea \u2019 s growing nuclear arsenal .\nAbe capped his visit to Washington with the speech to Congress \u2014 the first time a Japanese leader has addressed both chambers \u2014 where he also spent some time addressing his country \u2019 s past transgressions during World War II .\n\u201c Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries , \u201d he said . \u201c We must not avert our eyes from that . \u201d\nThe conciliatory statements to U.S. lawmakers , however , stopped short of a full apology for Japan \u2019 s wartime conduct in the Asia-Pacific region , including its World War II practice of providing so-called comfort women , by and large non-Japanese sex slaves , to Japanese soldiers .\n\u201c History is harsh , \u201d he said . \u201c What is done can not be undone . \u201d", "We hear quite a bit of misleading rhetoric against China these days . Let 's grant , for argument 's sake , that the Chinese overproduce steel , dump some of that steel into Canada and Europe before it makes its way to the United States , pilfer intellectual property and have a plan to dominate the world by 2025 . It 's still not a good \u2588\u2588\u2588 to protect a few privileged American producers by slapping tariffs on the stuff other U.S. firms use to manufacture their goods\u2014or for the government to restrict the supply of goods that households consume to raise their standard of living .\nSince when do free market advocates believe that a communist authoritarian regime like the one in China can successfully and centrally plan and execute economic growth ? These days , newspapers are full of quotes by noted free marketeers who would usually oppose trade barriers such as those put in place by the Trump administration but nevertheless support such barriers because they worry that China 's 2025 `` plan '' will successfully lead to its domination of many industries .\nIt 's puzzling . George Mason University economist Don Boudreaux correctly commented on this inconsistency by writing that those on the political right who usually believe in markets `` correctly understand that the U.S. government can not out-perform the market at 'picking ' winners , but they \u2026 nevertheless believe that foreign governments , especially those governments with authoritarian histories and that currently possess authoritarian powers , are invested with uncanny abilities to improve the performance of their economies with subsidies , trade restraints , and industrial policies . ''\nIf these guys really believe that such a top-down government-controlled economy can work in China , why not try it here ? And if it works so well in China , why does n't it work in Venezuela or Cuba ?\nAlso puzzling is the constant refrain about China producing more than it needs . Even if this overcapacity were a boon for China , it would still be to the benefit of millions of American consumers . It lowers costs for thousands of small U.S. manufacturers and steel consumers . But in reality , this `` overproduction '' is a tragedy for the Chinese people because their government 's subsidization of steel production inevitably diverts resources from other areas of the Chinese economy . I do n't hear Americans and Europeans complaining about all the stuff China is n't producing because its government stupidly wants to produce a lot of steel . So the next time you encounter someone lamenting China 's overcapacity , shed a tear or two for the Chinese people and recognize that some American non-steel production might fall if ( and when ) Beijing stops diverting so many resources into Chinese steel factories .\n`` But what about American steel producers ? ! '' some plead . If you think trade is the main culprit in the steel-industry woes , think again . For decades , Americans have imported between 25 and 30 percent of our steel . That leaves domestic steel with a healthy 70 to 75 percent of the market . To the extent that steel jobs were lost , the \u2588\u2588\u2588 is that American steel executives implemented labor-saving innovations ( read : technology ) just like the rest of the manufacturing industries . These innovations made individual steel workers more productive and raised their wages . As a reminder , steel employment in the United States actually peaked in 1956 , long before China entered in the picture .\n`` But the Chinese steal intellectual property from us ! '' others say . Still , the best way to protect the property rights of some Americans\u2014many of whom freely choose to operate in China under these conditions\u2014is n't to impose import taxes ( tariffs ) and thereby penalize millions of American consumers . Such `` retaliation '' by the U.S. government is a policy of picking winners and losers , which is unfair and inefficient . It also puts thousands of other American jobs in jeopardy , exposes us to retaliation and causes U.S. companies ( like Harley-Davidson ) to move their production abroad . The best solutions use international organizations to challenge China 's actions and form alliances with like-minded allies .\nI hope you wo n't read this piece as a defense of the Chinese regime . There 's no excuse for the way it treats its people , abuses human rights and deprives the Chinese from free market economic policies . However , many of the arguments levied against China as they relate to trade either misidentify the true victims or advocate the wrong remedies . And let 's not forget that new U.S. trade and investment restrictions wo n't make China more like us , but more government control over the U.S. economy will make us more like China .", "CLOSE After a week of hints and uncertainty , President Donald Trump on Thursday announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum but with temporary exemptions for Canada and Mexico as he seeks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement . ( March 8 ) AP\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite warnings by allies that a trade war will increase prices for consumers worldwide , President Trump signed proclamations Thursday imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and said they are designed to protect American industries .\nIn statements from the White House , Trump said his plan does exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs , pending the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations , and allows other countries to apply for relief from the new duties .\n`` We have to protect and build our steel and aluminum industries , while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are really friends of ours , '' Trump said while surrounded by steel and aluminum workers invited to the White House .\nCLOSE The last time a trade war happened in the U.S. , things did n't go well for the economy . Will history repeat itself as Trump puts a tariff on steel and aluminum ? Here are the facts . Just the FAQs\nHe also described the move as `` vital to our national security , '' and said more trade policy changes are on the way .\nTrump said there would be 25 % tariffs on steel and 10 % on aluminum , but there would be exemptions and possible changes .\n`` I 'll have a right to go up or down , depending on the country , and I 'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries , '' he told his Cabinet earlier in theb day . `` We just want fairness . Because we have not been treated fairly by other countries . ''\nWhen Trump announced his tariff plans a week ago , aides said there would be no exemptions or carve outs .\nThe European Union and other allies have threatened to retaliate with tariffs of their own on American products , from Florida orange juice to Wisconsin motorcycles to Kentucky bourbon . Trump 's decision `` will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy and it has to be met by firm and proportionate response , '' said Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m , the EU commissioner for trade .\nIn addition to threatening to go after American products , other countries ridiculed Trump 's claim that the tariffs serve the need of national defense , saying the penalties fall more on allies like Canada than potential adversaries like China .\nMany fellow Republicans also objected to Trump 's tariffs , predicting a trade war that will increase costs for consumers everywhere .\nOutgoing Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , who vowed to introduce legislation nullify Trump 's action , ridiculed the notion of `` flexible '' tariffs : `` What does that mean ? One day you wake up and you say , \u2018 I don \u2019 t like Australia ? \u2019 ... That \u2019 s unbelievable . \u201d\nLooking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House . We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 8 , 2018\nThe critics include House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wisc. , who said that `` I 'm just not a fan of broad based and across the board tariffs because there are a lot of unintended consequences . ''\nTrump justified the decision by citing `` shuttered plants and mills , '' laid-off workers , and `` the decimation of entire communities , '' all the result of what he called decades of unfair foreign trade practices that targeted U.S. industries . Economists said automation has killed off more factory jobs , and that free trade has bolstered many sectors of the U.S. economy .\nDuring the signing ceremony , Trump invited some of the steel workers , hard hats in hands , to speak about how their town have been hurt by the decline of the industry .\nThe trade debate played a major role in Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign .\nDuring the Cabinet meeting , Trump said he would flexible with `` real friends . '' In addition to Canada and Mexico , Trump mentioned Australia \u2014 `` we have a trade surplus with Australia '' \u2014 while criticizing Germany for what he considers a lack of defense spending .\n`` We have some friends and some enemies , where we have been tremendously taken advantage of over the years , on trade , and on military , '' Trump said .\nMore : Trump claims 'trade wars ' are 'easy to win ' day after tariff talk roils stock market\nMore : Trump escalates trade war rhetoric with threat of European auto tariffs\nTrump said Canada and Mexico , the U.S. partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement , could avoid tariffs if they grant concessions during ongoing negotiations to re-work NAFTA , a trade deal the president has long criticized .\n`` With Mexico and Canada , we 're going to be throwing NAFTA into the loop , '' Trump told his Cabinet , though officials in those countries have denounced the president 's plan to link tariffs to the long-term trade deal .\nTrump announced his pledge in a surprise move a week ago , telling a group of executives he would impose 25 % tariffs on steel imports and 10 % on aluminum imports .\nThe tariff issue created major divisions within the White House itself , and led in part to this week 's resignation announcement by top economic adviser Gary Cohn .\nDuring his session with aides , Trump noted that it would be Cohn 's last Cabinet meeting . He also joked about his soon-to-be-ex-aide 's support of free trade , saying that Cohn \u201c may be a globalist , but I still like him . ''\nA number of Republicans , nominal allies of Trump , have criticized the tariffs .\nMore : Free trade foes are winning in economic battle in Trump 's White House\nHouse Republicans focused on trade , however , were not as hard on Trump as their Senate colleagues .\nRep. Kevin Brady , the Texas Republican who chairs the Ways and Means Committee , said exempting Canada and Mexico was \u201c a good first step . \u201d\n\u201c I urge the White House to go further to narrow these tariffs so they hit the intended target \u2013 and not U.S. workers , businesses , and families , \u201d Brady said .\nRep. David Reichert , R-Wash. , said the process for excluding countries needs to be effective .\n\u201c With 40 % of jobs tied to trade in my home state of Washington , we can not take actions that hurt the ability of our exporters to sell their American-made goods and services around the world , \u201d said Reichert , chairman of the trade subcommittee of Ways and Means .\nIn a letter released Wednesday , 107 House Republicans led by Brady urged Trump to \u201c tailor \u201d the tariffs to punish \u201c bad actors who trade unfairly and hurt America \u201d such as China .\nSen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , minority leader in the Senate , said he sympathizes with Trump 's criticism of trade rules , but the main culprit is China . Trump 's plan does n't address the Chinese , he said , because other countries supply more steel and aluminum to the U.S .\n`` Instead of getting right at China , the president \u2019 s across-the-board tariffs will cause more damage to key allies and other domestic industries , '' Schumer said . He also hit `` the haphazard way these tariffs were put together , '' and that Trump `` makes up his mind one day and changes it the next . ''\nTrump cast the tariffs at a first step in a series of trade changes . During the signing ceremony , he outlined a `` reciprocal tax '' to combat duties that China and other countries place on U.S. products .\nLike other business groups , the National Retail Federation called the tariffs `` a self-inflicted wound '' that will lead to `` higher prices for products ranging from canned goods to cars to electronics . ''\nSome economists defended Trump 's plan , saying trade has sucked the life out of American manufacturing .\nPeter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland , tweeted that Trump `` is not starting a trade war '' because `` we are already in one , '' especially with China .\n`` The other side has bazookas & we have been using water pistols , '' Morici said . `` China has targeted one U.S. industry after another , thrown millions of Americans out of work . Time to fight back . ''", "In a move met by applause from at least one congressman , the Energy Department announced a pilot program for research into domestic mining of rare earth elements .\nRare earth elements are a series of seemingly obscure elements on the Periodic Table that are crucial for production of electronics , military equipment and some medications .\nAccording to Rep. Lou Barletta ( R-Pa. ) , 100 percent of America 's supply of these elements comes from China .\nChina supplies 85 percent of the world 's overall production , according to the congressman .\nThe elements - which include Yttrium , Scandium , Neodymium and Cerium - can be extracted in a variety of ways , including in the aftermath of coal mining .\nThe Energy Department said it will invest nearly $ 7 million into researching ways to mine and produce these elements in the United States .\nFirst New Coal Mine of Trump Era Opens in Pennsylvania\nHuckabee : Trump Supporters Being Subjected to 'Terrorism ' for Their Vote\nPirro Blasts GOP : 'You 're In Power - Do Something ' to Pass Trump Agenda\nBarletta said one of the sites the grant will fund is on the site of the Jeddo coal operation in Hazleton , Pa. , near Tamaqua .\n`` Studies have shown that the Appalachian coal fields throughout northeastern Pennsylvania contain some of the highest concentrations of rare earth elements , '' Barletta said in a press release .\nHe said it was a matter of national security that the U.S. be able to mine its own rare earth elements so that sectors like the military and healthcare do not need to depend on China .\nOther areas targeted by the Energy Department for the program include Albany , Ga. , Tuscaloosa , Ala. and Bluefield , Va. , on the West Virginia border .\nEarlier this month , President Trump celebrated the opening of the first American coal mine in recent times ..\nWatch the clip above to find out more about the administration 's plans for mining .\nScalise Shooter Had List of at Least 6 GOP Lawmakers ' Names", "Americans are being subjected to a massive public relations assault attempting to persuade them that \u201c fracking \u201d for natural gas and oil is the key to America \u2019 s energy future and that this change will free them forever from the bondage of oil imports .\nWhat has really changed is the nation \u2019 s energy conversation . Until recently , it was about how the United States should reduce its dependency on climate-changing fossil fuels . Now the \u201c conversation \u201d has become a harangue about the energy , jobs , and tax revenues the industry insists will flow from fracking and how these outweigh environmental concerns .\nThe data do not adequately support these claims . Though the fracking revolution is only a few years old , it \u2019 s already losing steam . There are several reasons why .\nFracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is a method of extracting natural gas and oil from low-permeability ( usually shale ) rock formations that don \u2019 t yield to conventional technologies . In the process , water , sand , and various chemicals are injected into shale rock at high pressure to open fractures in the rock and release gas or oil .\nA few years ago , fracking for shale gas or tight oil was still novel and confined to small regions , but now tens of thousands of wells have been drilled . Millions of Americans have personal experience with the noise , truck traffic , fumes , and local political turmoil that seem inevitably to follow in fracking \u2019 s wake . Hundreds of anti-fracking citizen groups have formed , public sentiment seems to be turning , and communities have begun seeking bans or moratoriums on the practice .\nEnvironmental problems can \u2019 t be swept under the carpet any longer . The image of a home-owner lighting his tap water on fire in Josh Fox \u2019 s documentary film \u201c Gasland \u201d has become a clich\u00e9 ; still , for a while the natural gas industry successfully argued that adverse effects from fracking on water , air , soil , wildlife , livestock , and human health are negligible .\nIndustry-funded studies declared the practice safe , and the Environmental Protection Agency appeared to back them up . Drilling companies tended to target economically depressed regions , where poverty forced most townsfolk to take whatever short-term jobs and production royalties were offered . Meanwhile , citizens who have suffered ill health effects or property damage that they link to fracking were led to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to receive settlement payoffs ( including two children ages 7 and 10 who have been given lifetime bans from speaking about fracking ) .\nBut the bad news just keeps leaking , like methane through a bad well casing . Former Mobil Oil vice president , Louis W. Allstadt , who spent his career running oil production operations and company mergers , now speaks on behalf of anti-fracking resistance groups . He points to studies revealing that compromised casings ( and resulting instances of water contamination ) are far more common than the industry claims .\nMeanwhile the Los Angeles Times has uncovered documents suggesting that the EPA has ignored evidence of environmental harms from fracking , choosing not to publicize or act on data collected by its own staff .\nWayne County , Pa. , activists are currently celebrating the cancellation of 1,500 drilling leases covering 100,000 acres of land . New York State \u2019 s moratorium on fracking remains in effect , despite massive industry efforts to end it . Meanwhile the Colorado city of Longmont has voted to ban fracking altogether , and the State of Colorado is suing the city in an attempt to overturn the ban .\nBut fracking has another problem that is even bigger than environmental and health problems or shifting public opinion , though less publicized : Its production potential seems to have been oversold .\nEveryone who pays attention to energy issues has heard that America has a hundred years or more of natural gas thanks to the application of fracking to shale reservoirs , and that the US is on track to outproduce Saudi Arabia now that oil is flowing from fracked fields in North Dakota and Texas . To most , the news at first sounded hopeful and reassuring . Yet as actual production numbers accumulate , it appears that claims made for fracking were simply too good to be true .\nIt turns out there are only a few geological formations in the US from which shale gas is being produced . In virtually all of them , except the Marcellus ( in Pennsylvania and West Virginia ) , studies such as one from the Post Carbon Institute show that production rates have plateaued or are in decline .\nWhy so soon ? A major challenge bedeviling drillers is the high variability within shale . Each tight oil or shale gas-bearing geologic formation tends to be characterized by a small core area ( usually a few counties ) where production is profitable and plentiful , surrounded by a much larger region where per-well production rates are lower to start with and drop fast \u2013 often falling 60 percent during the first year .\nGiven the expense of horizontal drilling and fracking , it \u2019 s hard to make money in noncore areas unless oil and gas prices are stratospheric . As the \u201c sweet spots \u201d get drilled to capacity , producers are being forced to the fringes , taking on more debt because sales of product don \u2019 t cover operating expenses .\nWith decline rates so high , promised production volumes are turning out to be more hype than reality . America \u2019 s hundred years of natural gas , heralded by President Obama as a national energy game changer , is based on unrealistic estimates \u2013 the amount of gas the Energy Information Administration says is \u201c technically recoverable. \u201d But this quantity includes resources that will never be produced for economic reasons . Some estimate that shale gas and tight oil production will top out and start to decline before 2020 .\nIn August , Shell took a $ 2 billion write-down on its liquids-rich shale assets in North America . While no details were released , it \u2019 s likely the company was simply acknowledging the unprofitability of leases in noncore regions . It could be that the oil industry itself is starting to learn that the shale revolution just ain \u2019 t all it was fracked up to be .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she and fellow senators plan to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which has jurisdiction over the electric grid 's reliability , to `` set minimum security standards for critical substations . ''\nThe April 16 , 2013 the attack on Pacific Gas & Electric \u2019 s Metcalf transmission substation involved snipping AT & T fiber-optic lines to knock out phone and 911 service , and firing shots into a PG & E substation , causing outages . The assault had not been widely publicized until The Wall Street Journal reported new details in a story on Wednesday .\nThe FBI is the lead agency in the investigation and an agency spokesman told the newspaper it doesn \u2019 t think the incident was a terror attack . However , Jon Wellinghoff , chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the time , called it `` the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the U.S. power grid that has ever occurred . ''\nThe incident began when intruders lifted heavy manhole covers at about 1:30 a.m. in two places on Monterey Highway south of San Jose , climbed under the road , and cut AT & T fiber optic cables , temporarily knocking out 911 service and phone service .\nIn a 19-minute period , gunmen fired more than 100 rounds into substation equipment , disabling 17 of 20 big transformers , causing about $ 16 million in damage , according to The Wall Street Journal . No arrests have been made in the case .\nIn December , during an oversight hearing , Rep. Henry Waxman , D-Calif. , described `` an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons . Communications were disrupted . The attack inflicted substantial damage .

He is also a longtime Republican donor .\nThe Senate confirmed Brouillette 70-15 . Several Democrats voted against him after alleging that he failed to give sufficient answers about Perry 's dealings with Ukraine .

Keystone foes pin hopes on Obama\nGreen activists aren \u2019 t resigned to losing the Keystone battle . But Friday \u2019 s latest blow was yet another disappointment in their often strained relationship with President Barack Obama .\nThe new State Department report that discounted most of the environmental community \u2019 s warnings about the Keystone XL oil pipeline puts the final decision on the project closer to Obama \u2019 s desk , after years in which he \u2019 s been able to dodge rendering a verdict .\nIt all may come down to which Obama makes the final call : the president who declared in Tuesday \u2019 s State of the Union that \u201c climate change is a fact \u201d or the one who , in the same speech , touted an \u201c all of the above \u201d approach to energy policy \u2014 a phrase that environmentalists had specifically urged him to stop using .\nThis is also the same White House that picked health care over a giant cap-and-trade bill in 2010 but three years later launched the biggest-ever regulatory attack on carbon pollution from coal-burning power plants .\nAdding to the tension for deep-pocketed , politically connected greens is the fact that Friday \u2019 s unwelcome message on Keystone came from a department led by one of their most passionate champions , Secretary of State John Kerry .\nSome environmentalists fumed , while others looked for silver linings , including some additional language in the sprawling final document that could be used to bolster their arguments .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just a study ; it doesn \u2019 t recommend a course of action , \u201d said Kenny Bruno , a lead spokesman in the campaign against tapping Canadian oil sands . Pipeline critics , he said , have \u201c the winds at our backs \u201d because the decision is \u201c no longer in the hands of lower-level bureaucrats in the State Department . It \u2019 s in the hands of climate champions Barack Obama and John Kerry . \u201d\nSierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the analysis gives Obama and Kerry \u201c everything \u201d they need to reject the pipeline . \u201c We are cautiously confident that he will make the right choice , \u201d Brune said of Obama .\nThe analysis is \u201c just an input , \u201d billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer said . \u201c So we don \u2019 t have an answer yet , and the fight is far from over . \u201d\nBut others denounced the entire review process so far as corrupt and flawed .\n\u201c This document will be seen by the entire environmental community \u2014 in which I certainly include myself \u2014 as a sham , \u201d said Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D-Ariz. ) . He was one of several Keystone opponents who complained about news reports in which oil industry groups or Canadian officials offered previews of what they had heard the study would say .\n\u201c The fact that the Canadian government and the oil industry were reportedly briefed on today \u2019 s news before Congress was given the courtesy of a heads-up speaks volumes , \u201d Grijalva said . \u201c It encourages the already widely held impression that the fix was in from the beginning . If the administration expects to avoid the lasting stink of having ignored every red flag in the book , it needs to explain itself . \u201d\nThe added details in the final version will allow Obama and Kerry to use them as they see fit , said one former Obama administration official closely following the Keystone process .\n\u201c I think it would be wrong to conclude that this is a rubber stamp for the project and right to conclude it provides additional information that the administration will be looking at before a final decision is made , \u201d the former official said . \u201c The administration is looking to keep its options open here . \u201d\nObama has offered some hints that he thinks both sides have overstated the impact of the Alberta-to-Texas oil pipeline , which the State Department study indicates will be neither a major environmental problem nor a powerhouse job creator . But by letting the decision linger for years , Obama has also allowed pipeline opponents to elevate its political significance \u2014 adding it to the holy trinity of green litmus tests alongside drilling in Alaska \u2019 s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and saving the Pacific Northwest \u2019 s spotted owl .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t necessarily think that there \u2019 s a real climate change impact in this decision , \u201d said another former administration official who worked on energy issues . \u201c The oil is there . It \u2019 s going to be extracted . Its going to be sold to someone . By trying to frame this as a big political battle and a test of the president \u2019 s courage , I think it was a strategic miscalculation by the environmental community . \u201d\nPolitically , though , some who follow the issue say Keystone remains a tough call for the administration . It plays green activists and Democratic donors against each other headed into this year \u2019 s midterm elections . And several party activists offered contrasting arguments for whether a pro-Keystone or anti-Keystone decision works more to the Democrats \u2019 benefit .\nThe second former administration official said Obama would have reason to consider making a pro-Keystone decision now to take away a potent Republican talking point . Keystone has become \u201c a dog whistle for their [ GOP ] base , probably because the environmental community made it one , \u201d the ex-official said .\nBut Chris Lehane , a longtime party operative who worked for Al Gore \u2019 s 2000 campaign and is now affiliated with Steyer \u2019 s anti-Keystone super PAC , said Obama would risk dampening midterm turnout among two critical Democratic voting demographics \u2014 Hispanics and under-30s \u2014 by permitting the pipeline . \u201c If you \u2019 re talking about the raw politics of this , if you \u2019 re a Democrat and trying to maximize turnout , you have to look at which cohorts you \u2019 re trying to maximize , \u201d he said .\nLehane also recalled Obama \u2019 s recent comments to The New Yorker \u2019 s David Remnick about a president having a chance to influence only one paragraph in the history books . \u201c This would fall square in the type of paragraph the president was addressing in that conversation , \u201d Lehane said .\n\u201c Is it politically easier for him to approve this thing ? Maybe , \u201d said Roger Ballentine , a former environmental adviser to Kerry and President Bill Clinton . \u201c But I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s politically hard to reject it . \u201d\nHe argued that the need for a new pipeline to send Canadian oil to the Gulf Coast is unwarranted when U.S. oil production levels have topped exports for the first time since 1995 .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m a senator and someone tries to beat me up on this , I say , \u2018 Look , what we should be doing is focusing on the infrastructure we need to responsibly develop , \u2019 \u201d said Ballentine , now president of Green Strategies .\nObama is in a no-win situation as he weighs the appeals from greens , Republicans , industry and Canada , which is both a leading U.S. trading partner and \u201c one of our best friends in the world , \u201d said former State Department spokesman P.J . Crowley .\n\u201c The politics are complicated and to a large extent zero-sum , \u201d Crowley said . \u201c Which is why the administration is taking its time trying to manage a least-bad outcome . \u201d\nOn the pipeline \u2019 s merits , people on both sides said the final State Department report left Obama some room to either kill or reject the project . For instance , the report said building Keystone is unlikely by itself to cause Canada to dramatically expand production from its western oil sands , increasing greenhouse gas emissions . That may happen \u2014 or not happen \u2014 for reasons besides the pipeline .\nThe analysis was clearly a disappointment to many pipeline critics , who wanted the State Department to deem the pipeline an outright climate and environmental hazard .\nBut pipeline opponents also offered differing interpretations on whether the report had softened the State Department \u2019 s past view that the project wouldn \u2019 t pose significant environmental harm .\n\u201c In this report , for the very first time , the State Department acknowledges a scenario in which the Keystone XL tar sands export pipeline dramatically increases carbon pollution , \u201d said National Wildlife Federation CEO Larry Schweiger . \u201c That \u2019 s a welcome and long overdue change , and it gives President Obama all the evidence he needs to reject Keystone XL . \u201d\nClimate activist Bill McKibben , a Vermont-based author spearheading the fight against the pipeline , was less optimistic . He said the report \u201c reflects some grudging movement \u201d by the State Department to recognize the environmental impact of the pipeline . \u201c They \u2019 re at the point of saying night is late afternoon , \u201d he said .\nMeanwhile , at the State Department on Friday afternoon , Assistant Secretary Kerri-Ann Jones repeatedly told reporters , \u201c Whether one pipeline specifically would affect the overall development of the oil sands , that specific answer is not in this document . \u201d", "After spending more than five years and billions of dollars trying to re-create the U.S. shale boom overseas , some of the world \u2019 s biggest oil companies are starting to give up amid a world-wide collapse in crude prices .\nChevron Corp. CVX -0.02 % , Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM -0.78 % and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have packed up nearly all of their hydraulic fracturing wildcatting in Europe , Russia and China . The reasons vary from sanctions in Russia , a ban in France , a moratorium in Germany and poor results in Poland to crude prices below what it can cost to produce a barrel of shale oil .\nChevron halted its last European fracking operations in February when it pulled out of Romania . Shell said it is cutting world-wide shale spending by 30 % in places including Turkey , Ukraine and Argentina . Exxon has pulled out of Poland and Hungary , and its German fracking operations are on hold .\nThe result : Outside the U.S. , where fracking has produced a historic glut of oil , only China , Argentina and Canada have commercial shale production , the U.S. Energy Information Administration says , though America holds less than 10 % of the world \u2019 s estimated shale reserves . Europe , including Russia , and China alone have nearly triple the reserves of the U.S. , according to the EIA .\n\u201c The pace of development outside North America is slower everywhere than people thought it would be , \u201d Simon Henry , Shell \u2019 s chief financial officer , said in a recent interview .\nA recovery in oil prices could change the equation , giving big companies more room to take risky bets on shale . And bright spots for shale prospectors outside North America still exist .\nRegions of Argentina and Algeria appear to be \u201c as good as the U.S. , \u201d says Faouzi Aloulou , an EIA project manager who analyzes shale prospects . Two French companies and a British firm are planning to drill in the U.K. , where there is a debate over the practice \u2019 s health and environmental effects . In Poland , small companies\u2014the kind that pioneered the U.S. shale boom\u2014are still drilling despite their big rivals \u2019 discouraging results .\n\u201c The publicity is bad , but the reality is it \u2019 s going to be down to the smaller companies to prove the play , as they did in the U.S. , \u201d says Ois\u00edn Fanning , the executive chairman of San Leon Energy PLC , a U.K.-listed explorer that announced a commercial gas discovery in Poland in February and expects its first sales in early 2016 .\nFracking works by using water , sand and chemicals to fracture underground rock and hold the cracks open , allowing oil and gas trapped in the rocks to flow . Unlike the long-term projects that the world \u2019 s biggest oil companies specialize in , shale wells tend to have short lives , and developing a shale field requires drilling many holes over a short period .\nThe technology worked well for small producers in North America , but oil giants like Exxon and Shell , with their thick layers of management and slow drilling-approval processes , largely missed out on the profits there .\nKnowing other countries had shale , the big companies last decade looked elsewhere to see if they could build a boom from scratch . Eastern European officials who were eager to wean their nations off Russian gas welcomed the explorers .\nChevron beginning late last decade invested in Romania , Lithuania and Poland , which some geologists and oil-business-development specialists said had Europe \u2019 s most attractive shale potential .\n\u201c In Poland you had a mix of a higher resource estimate plus a government keen on promoting shale gas to reduce dependence on Russian gas , \u201d said Richard Sarsfield-Hall of Finnish consulting and engineering firm P\u00f6yry .\nChevron kept drilling , even after the EIA in 2013 lowered its estimates of Poland \u2019 s shale-gas reserve by about 20 % and other producers like France \u2019 s Total SA threw in the towel .\nBy 2014 , Chevron \u2019 s Eastern Europe bet wasn \u2019 t looking good . It exited Lithuania last summer . Last fall , Romania \u2019 s president said the country didn \u2019 t appear to have any shale resources . Then , in January , Chevron said it had decided to leave Poland .\n\u201c Shale gas opportunities across Central and Eastern Europe do not compete with other opportunities within Chevron \u2019 s global portfolio , \u201d a spokeswoman said . The company is still evaluating shale gas exploration in South Africa , a spokesman said ..\nConocoPhillips is the only large oil company still working in Poland .\nExxon had similar letdowns in Hungary , which it left in 2009 , and Poland , which it exited in 2012 . Exxon \u2019 s efforts in Germany have been thwarted by a fracking moratorium , and Western sanctions over Ukraine have kept it and other international oil companies from developing Russian shale .\nNow , an Exxon spokesman says , the company \u2019 s only ongoing non-North America shale exploration is in Argentina and Colombia .\nOne problem the companies have faced is the high cost of shale drilling outside the U.S. when oil prices are low . Exploration wells in new areas require experimentation and lack the economies of scale in a more developed area . Wells in Poland and China can cost up to $ 25 million each , while American wells on average cost about $ 5 million , said Melissa Stark , lead author of a 2014 shale report by Accenture LLP .\nShell first discussed shale exploration with Chinese officials in 2006 , said people familiar with the matter . At the time , the Anglo-Dutch company was looking for shale resources around the world , and struck deals in Sweden , Turkey , Russia and Ukraine .\nThe Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions derailed plans in Russia and Ukraine . Shell left Sweden in 2011 after exploration was unsuccessful . A Shell spokeswoman said the company is analyzing the results of wells drilled with a partner in Turkey , and is waiting to hear from the South African government about proceeding with shale projects there .\nIn China , Shell found shale gas in 2011 . But problematic geology , infrastructure and local protests delayed progress , company officials and documents say . Last fall , Shell decided to pull back efforts there .\nMs. Stark of Accenture said countries with strong national oil companies such as China , Argentina and Saudi Arabia were more likely to lead shale development outside the U.S . They have a mandate to extract their countries \u2019 resources , government support , and lots of money .\n\u201c You need a player with deep pockets and who can be there for several years , \u201d she said . State-run companies \u201c are there for the long term so they can invest for the long-term . \u201d", "Brussels ( AFP ) - Europe 's refugee and migrant crisis has escalated over the summer , leaving the continent divided over how to deal with a flood of people led by Syrians fleeing war in their homeland .\nA record surge in numbers , and the opening up of new routes over the Balkans in addition to the Mediterranean sea route , have prompted the EU to call a special meeting on the issue in two weeks .\nHere are the key questions and answers about the biggest crisis of its kind to face Europe since World War II :\nThe situation in Syria , the origin of the largest number of refugees , has worsened because of the rise of the Islamic State extremist group and continuing civil war , so more people are fleeing .\nMore people are coming directly to Europe instead of staying in refugee camps in neighbouring countries that are bursting at the seams , says Melissa Fleming , spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency .\nBut also the longer people spend in refugee camps in Lebanon , Jordan and Turkey , the more likely they are to realise they can not start a new life there and want to leave , especially with no sign of the four-year civil war ending anytime soon .\nRecently people are being drawn by Germany 's announcement that it expects to process 800,000 asylum applications this year , and Berlin 's decision to become the first EU state to stop automatically returning Syrian asylum-seekers to their first EU port of entry .\nNearly 340,000 refugees and migrants illegally crossed the border into Europe from January to July 2015 , according to the EU 's border agency Frontex . The figure compares to 280,000 for the whole of 2014 .\nThe UN refugee agency separately gives the figure of more than 300,000 migrants and refugees having crossed the Mediterranean so far this year , compared to 219,000 crossings in the whole of 2014 .\nAround 2,500 have died this year so far , compared to 3,500 for the whole of last year , it says .\nSyria and Afghanistan were the two countries most represented among migrants entering the EU , according to Frontex .\nThe top five countries for arrivals in Europe on all sea crossings are Syria ( 43 percent ) , Eritrea ( 10 percent ) , Nigeria ( 5 percent ) , Somalia ( 3 percent ) , and others ( 27 percent ) , according to the UN .\nNine out of ten of those making the Mediterranean crossing to Italy are Africans , however .\nBut nearly a fifth of those coming over the Balkans are Kosovans , leading Germany and other EU states to call for a register of 'safe ' countries to which migrants can be returned .\n- WHERE ARE THEY ARRIVING , AND BY WHAT ROUTES ? -\nGreece , Hungary and Italy are bearing the brunt of the problem .\nGreece had the most landings with nearly 200,000 this year , the UN says . Greece sees so many because of people getting boats from Turkey for the islands of Lesbos , Chios , Samos and Kos .\nItaly has seen 110,000 landings this year , with people taking the central Mediterranean route on rickety boats from Libya . But numbers have slowed due to the breakdown of order in Libya and the danger of the route .\nThe Western Balkans have seen a huge surge in arrivals of mostly asylum seekers fleeing Middle East wars , who cross the region after crossing by boat from Turkey to Greece .\nHungary alone reported more than 34,800 detections from January to July , and the area as a whole has seen 102,342 , Frontex says .\nThe most popular final destinations are Germany , Sweden and Britain .\n- WHAT HAS THE EU DONE , AND WHAT MORE CAN IT DO ? -\nThe EU was stung into action after a horrific Mediterranean shipwreck in April that left 700 migrants dead .\nThe bloc boosted its maritime search and rescue efforts and set up a military naval task force aiming to tackle people smugglers .\nIt is also setting up `` hot spots '' in frontline European countries to expedite the classification of newcomers as either refugees or economic migrants .\nBut plans for the compulsory relocation of 40,000 migrants , to take the strain off Greece and Italy , collapsed because of bickering between EU countries .\nIn the end they merely agreed to voluntary pledges to take in 32,000 , plus another 22,500 Syrian asylum seekers currently in camps outside the EU .\nMany believe those numbers are dwarfed by the scale of the problem and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will unveil new proposals in his state of the union speech next week .\nThey may include relaxing the `` Dublin rules '' that Germany has already waived , which currently mean asylum requests must be dealt with by the country where the person first arrives .\nMeanwhile , rights groups advocate other solutions , such as giving work visas to refugees and migrants , arguing that it would reduce the smuggling that leads to tragedies .", "The EU \u2019 s chief negotiator , Michel Barnier , has welcomed Dominic Raab to Brussels with a thinly veiled critique of Theresa May \u2019 s Chequers plan and a 13-week deadline in which to solve the problem of the Irish border .\nAppearing with Barnier for the first time in the Belgian capital , the new Brexit secretary , clutching a copy of the UK \u2019 s recently published Brexit white paper , called for more \u201c vim , vigour and energy \u201d in the troubled negotiations .\nThe former Foreign Office lawyer told reporters he was \u201c looking forward to intensifying , heating up , the negotiations \u201d , after stepping into the role following the resignation of David Davis over the paper , which sets out how the UK is in effect seeking to stay in the single market for goods by following a raft of EU laws .\nThe differing priorities between the two negotiators were clearly evident , however , as they stepped out in front of reporters together at the European commission headquarters .\nTory MP casts doubt on claim pairing breach was honest mistake as row escalates - Politics live Read more\nWhile Raab conceded there were some \u201c gaps \u201d in the withdrawal agreement that needed to be filled , Barnier emphasised the \u201c urgency \u201d of finding a solution for the most thorny issue in that deal : avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland .\nBarnier told reporters : \u201c We have a lot of work to do with our teams . There are , as you know , 13 weeks left , before the October European council . In this time , short time , we have two things to do . We must finalise the withdrawal agreement and we are not yet there on governance .\n\u201c We must also prepare a political declaration on our future relationship . On the withdrawal agreement it is a matter of urgency to agree to a legally applicable backstop on Ireland and northern Ireland . We need an all-weather insurance policy . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c On the future relationship , the EU proposed in March an unprecedented partnership not only in economic and trade where we want an ambitious free trade agreement that respects the integrity of the market but also on internal and external security , where a close partnership between us means more important than ever given the geopolitical context .\n\u201c Our challenge will be to find common ground between the fundamental principles that define the EU and the UK positions . That is all for now , more is to come . Stay tuned . \u201d\nThe two men took part in a short discussion on the UK \u2019 s white paper before dining together at the British embassy in Brussels .\nBarnier gave Raab the book Going to the Mountain by Nelson Mandela \u2019 s grandson , Ndaba Mandela , as a gift .\nRaab , in turn , gave the former French minister a copy of Isaiah Berlin \u2019 s The Hedgehog and the Fox . The philosopher \u2019 s most popular essay explores the difference between thinkers who view the world through a single defining idea and those who base their world view on experience .\nIt is understood Raab also insisted to Barnier that the Brexit talks should continue throughout the summer , despite the offer of a two-week break from the European commission .\nFollowing his first talks with Barnier , the new cabinet minister made it clear he would be spending more time in Brussels than Davis , who spent only four hours in face-to-face negotiations with his counterpart .\nRaab said : \u201c We had a very good , constructive conversation . We talked about the progress we \u2019 ve made on the withdrawal agreement . It was also an opportunity to present the white paper on the future relationship we want with the EU .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve only got 12 weeks really left to nail down the details of the agreement , so I set out our proposals , and offered to meet with Michel Barnier throughout the summer to intensify negotiations , to get some energy , get some drive and get some heat on them to make sure we can conclude this agreement in good time . I \u2019 m sure in good faith , if that energy and that ambition is reciprocated , as I \u2019 m confident it will be , we will get there . \u201d\nAsked if a no-deal scenario was more likely after cabinet resignations , Raab declined to directly respond but said domestic battles would not undermine his role .\nHe said : \u201c I think as you get closer to the line , the preparations need to be intensified. \u201c We \u2019 re going to be increasing the preparations for no deal , but we \u2019 re focused above all on the negotiations to get the best deal . \u201d\nThe meeting came as the EU issued a warning to member states in a 16-page document on the risks of a no-deal Brexit . It notes the impact of a no-deal scenario would be \u201c very real \u201d for citizens , and leaves open the possibility of a visa requirement for Britons travelling to the continent after Brexit should a deal not be in place ..\nA senior EU diplomat said the \u201c very volatile \u201d political situation in London and the lack of progress in the talks in Brussels on key issues had led many to believe that the risk of a no-deal scenario had increased in recent weeks .\n\u201c Contingency planning for the worst possible outcome is not a sign of mistrust in the negotiations , \u201d the paper says . \u201c The commission is devoting very significant resources and committing great efforts to achieve an agreement . This remains our goal . However , the outcome of negotiations can not be predicted . \u201d\nBrexit : Raab and Barnier to meet as EU steps up no-deal warnings Read more\nThe UK government also appeared to be stepping up warnings about the possibility of no deal , by asking up to 250,000 small businesses who export to the EU to prepare to make a customs declaration . The idea is intended to be one of a series of public warnings issued over the summer about the possible impact of a no-deal scenario on the UK economy .\nBarnier will discuss Brexit with European affairs ministers from the EU27 on Friday . An official said there would be a lot of questions on the white paper , which was \u201c detailed but still unclear to a certain extent \u201d .\nStressing the unpredictability of British politics , the senior EU official said they might as well \u201c read the entrails of animals \u201d to know what is happening .", "\u201c She doesn \u2019 t just believe in Europe , she embodies that and radiates it , \u201d says Jan Techau , a political analyst at The German Marshall Fund of the United States . \u201c That is a huge part of the deal . \u201d\nBut Dr. von der Leyen , the first woman to take the European Union \u2019 s top job , has impeccable credentials for the post , observers say .

Two years later Ms. Merkel tapped her to be family affairs minister in her first government .\nIn that job , and later as labor minister , she made a name for herself as a briskly modern reformer dragging her party , the center-right Christian Democratic Union , kicking and screaming into the 21st century .\nThe CDU was largely a party of old white men who thought a woman \u2019 s role should be limited to \u201c kinder , k\u00fcche , kirche \u201d \u2013 children , kitchen , church \u2013 says Mr. Goffart . \u201c Merkel and von der Leyen abolished that . \u201d\nHannibal Hanschke/Reuters German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen attend the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) party congress in Leipzig , Germany , Nov. 22 , 2019 . The general perception in Germany three months ago was that Ms. von der Leyen 's political career appeared to be reaching its end .\nAmong Dr. von der Leyen \u2019 s hallmark policies with a strong feminist flavor : providing daycare for all infants over 12 months , two months \u2019 paternity leave for new fathers , and women \u2019 s quotas in the boardroom ( though parliament voted this down ) . She also supported same-sex marriage .\nSuch reforms \u201c were a very important cornerstone of her career , \u201d says Mr. Goffart .\nThough she comes from a conservative background , \u201c she is on the progressive wing of the CDU , \u201d says Mr. Techau . \u201c She is not a conservative hardliner . \u201d\nDr. von der Leyen herself has spoken of an \u201c inner freedom \u201d that she acquired in London during a year studying at the London School of Economics in the late 1970s , although she also admitted , in an interview with the German weekly \u201c Zeit , \u201d that \u201c I lived much more than I studied .\n\u201c London was the epitome of modernity : freedom , the joy of life , trying everything , \u201d she recalled in the interview . \u201c For me , coming from the rather monotonous , white Germany , that was fascinating . \u201d\nShe also has fond memories of her years in California , where she lived when her husband was teaching at Stanford University , Mr. Goffart says . \u201c She found Americans much more tolerant of noisy kids than Germans . She said it was a lot easier to live with children there . \u201d\nWhile her years abroad may have given Dr. von der Leyen an international outlook , she honed her political skills in Germany , where negotiation and compromise form the bedrock of political life . \u201c That \u2019 s her strength , \u201d says Mr. Goffart . \u201c She is used to finding compromises and that \u2019 s what you need in the EU . \u201d\nAlready Dr. von der Leyen has shown signs of her inclination to be a conciliator , coming up with a policy platform striving for balance , that offers something to as many competing interest groups as possible .\nBut she is by no means a pushover , argues Mr. Techau . When she took over the Defense Ministry soon after Berlin abolished conscription , he recalls , she brought in measures to make military life more family friendly so as to attract more volunteers . \u201c Old soldiers and pundits gave her a lot of stick for that , but she showed no nerves and it paid off , \u201d he recalls .\nHer public image , he adds , is of a \u201c strong-minded \u201d woman . \u201c There is a strictness to her , a directness , even a certain hardness . \u201d\nDr. von der Leyen has also attracted criticism from CDU colleagues for grandstanding , reveling in photo ops that advance her own career and \u201c sometimes going a little over the top , \u201d explains Mr. Goffart , such as when she visited a German Air Force base looking like Tom Cruise , in \u201c Top Gun \u201d -style aviator sunglasses .\nIf such behavior has made her enemies in her own party , her performance at the Defense Ministry \u2013 where she had several run-ins with the top military brass \u2013 has disappointed many Germans ; she left office as the second least popular minster in the cabinet . \u201c She was a falling star , \u201d says Dr. Gero Neugebauer , who teaches politics at the Free University of Berlin . \u201c She started strong and ended weak . But she survived . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThe general perception that she had failed at the Defense Ministry , however , put an end to her ambition to succeed her boss , Ms. Merkel , and three months ago her political career appeared to be reaching its end .\n\u201c Perhaps she was surprised by her good luck , \u201d says Mr. Goffart . \u201c I think she must be really happy now to have a chance that she never expected . \u201d", "Elchingen , in the German state of Bavaria is not used to foreigners . And when townspeople in the village , hemmed in by corn fields , found out in late 2013 that they were going to be hosts to dozens of asylum seekers , many fought back , going door-to-door gathering some 800 signatures to say \u201c no . \u201d\n\u201c I felt so ashamed to be an Elchingener , \u201d says Renate Willbold-Vajagic , a local .\nSo when asylum-seekers from Syria , Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , and beyond arrived in this upper middle-class community , she and a group of residents , many retired , created an organization called the \u201c Friends of Asylum-seekers . \u201d\nTheir grassroots effort has grown into an impressive operation , based in a community center . Newcomers can borrow bikes to get from the village to the nearest city 6 miles away , take German classes , and get maps , orientation , or whatever else they need , from backpacks for children to thick winter coats .\nThis is the new face of Germany , where a sense of responsibility , position of strength , and confidence at integrating others before has turned it into Europe \u2019 s beacon of humanity amid the largest movement of people since World War II .\nAnd yet , for as much as it is willing \u2013 and able \u2013 to do , it can \u2019 t do everything . On Sunday , Germany shocked Europe by introducing border controls with Austria , from where thousands of migrants have passed into Munich \u2013 13,000 on Saturday alone . The move is seen not just as a response to record inflows into Germany but also a plan to push the European Union into sharing the burden as justice and interior ministers meet today in Brussels .\nGermany 's new Willkommenskultur , or \u201c welcome culture , \u201d has been celebrated across the country , but it is not universally embraced . Germany finds itself at a fragile moment , where the welcome could wither , as the world looks to how Germany leads amid a crisis that is testing Europe \u2019 s union arguably more than any issue since its founding .\nHajo Funke , a professor of political culture at the Free University of Berlin , says it \u2019 s a historic moment if Germany is able to maintain this \u201c new mentality of empathy . \u201d\n\u201c This wave of hundreds of thousands in each and every city and town is unique in the history of Germany , \u201d he says . \u201c As much as [ politicians ] really do their job , that empathy can hold . \u201d\nMunich has become the gateway into Germany for asylum-seekers , and ground zero of Willkommenskultur . On Saturday , as a large group of weary asylum-seekers arrived in Munich \u2019 s Hauptbahnhof , or main train station , people gathered to clap . \u201c Thank you , thank you , \u201d said one man , holding a toddler in his arms .\nThe migrants are shuttled to an unofficial reception center that is staffed , at any given time , with anywhere from 30 to 200 volunteers . Many of them are men and women who have taken vacation time to be here and offer what they can , from organizing the mounting bags of food and clothes to translating in Arabic . One woman is turned away from volunteering , told it would be unfair to the others who have placed their names on waiting lists . Another man tries to give the group cash , twice , but they reject it .\nThe images of Alan Kurdi , the dead Syrian boy washed ashore , of migrants stranded in Hungary after borders were shut , and of others suffocated in the back of a truck in Austria have washed away apathy and passive observation here . But the shock was felt viscerally , touching a historic nerve .\nIt is in Germany where a small but vicious group has led the Continent \u2019 s most violent backlash to refugees , including arson attacks on refugee centers and demonstrations for the past year by the `` anti-Islamization '' group Pegida . Such protest has been louder in eastern Germany , with high unemployment rates and less exposure to foreigners . In big cities like Munich , which has a thriving community of Turks , Albanians , and Greeks , foreigners are often seen as a source of cultural enrichment \u2013 not as burdens on schools and health systems or as sources of cultural and religious clashes .\nBut hate-fueled actions have not been limited enough to explain them away as a geographical phenomenon . And Germans across the country have been horrified as they have stirred disturbing memories of the right-wing rise of Hitler , especially in Munich , the birthplace of national socialism .\nGerman political observers say it would be wrong to view the rush of volunteerism as an act of redemption . It is rather a counter-backlash . \u201c When I saw the images of [ anti-refugee sentiment ] , I felt like people had fallen out of time , using arguments and terms and sentences which in my view reflect the ones I know from the 1920s and '30s , \u201d says Magnus Brechtken , deputy director of the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich .\nThe Willkommenskultur , then , is a defense of Germany of the 21st century .\nOr as Willbold-Vajagic in Elchingen puts it : \u201c Now we have the chance to say , \u2018 We are Germany . We are welcoming . \u2019 \u201d\nEven a decade ago , Germany wasn \u2019 t able to so easily say that . When waves of southern Europeans and Turks came to the country in the '50s and '60s , they were called \u201c guest workers \u201d because Germany expected them to go home . In the '90s , when waves of refuges came in after the Iron Curtain fell and the Balkan wars pushed so many out , the government \u2019 s position \u2013 bluntly stated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl \u2013 was that Germany is \u201c not an immigrant country . \u201d\nToday he would be wrong to say the same . Last year the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) released figures showing that Germany had surpassed all countries except the US to become the world \u2019 s No . 2 recipient of immigrants .\nIt has gotten here through both learned experience and pragmatics . Mr. Funke says the Willkommenskultur is not simply a reaction to \u201c bad memories \u201d but an authentic expression built over the decades . After the silence surrounding Nazi atrocity in the '50s , the country came to terms with what it actually meant to reject \u201c others. \u201d It learned from failing to integrate \u201c guest workers. \u201d And it learned from the riots against refugees that flared in the '90s . From that history it was able to \u201c start a dialogue \u201d with Islam a decade ago and today recognizes its role as a diverse nation .\nPerhaps more important , it also recognizes that its rapidly aging society needs those immigrants .\n\u201c The public opinion has been for a long time that additional immigrants are part of the strategy to tackle Germany \u2019 s aging problem , \u201d says Thomas Liebig , senior administrator at the OECD 's international migration division .\nGermany has liberalized its laws for foreign workers and been trying to woo high-skilled ones from as far as China . Now some see hope in refugees , too , especially high-skilled Syrian refugees . Chambers of commerce have pushed for Germany to allow businesses to more easily hire them \u2013 underlining Germany \u2019 s views that taking people in can be a boon , not a burden .\nAnd in many towns low-skilled workers are in demand as well , the kind of jobs that Mr. Liebig says \u201c people don \u2019 t move for . \u201d\nChristoph Karmann , who connects refugees to apprentices for the Chamber of Trade and Crafts for Munich and Upper Bavaria , says that in 2014 , 4,700 apprenticeship positions were vacant in Bavaria \u2019 s small trades . Jobs particularly in demand include butchers , bakers , and construction workers . Through this year they \u2019 ve filled 130 positions with young refugees from Syria , Afghanistan , and Iraq .\nIt is this economic security that has turned Germany into Europe \u2019 s leader today . And many Germans are facing the migrant rush with the optimism and confidence that befits a superpower nation .\nMathias Wendeborn closes the windows of his cheerful pediatrician practice in a wealthy community of Munich at mid-day and zips off to the gates of the city \u2019 s largest refugee center . Here he has founded the nongovernmental organization Refudocs , after pushing for two years for a full-time \u201c refugee medical practice \u201d founded on more than idealism and goodwill . It needed a \u201c concept , \u201d he says : a professional , paying structure that would stand amid ebbing emotions .\nSara Miller Llana Mathias Wendeborn ( c. ) , a pediatrician who founded Refudocs , sees his first patient of the day , the child of newly arrived asylum seekers in Munich . A translator ( far l. ) helps .\nDr. Wendenborn says the will to create this management structure was not there at first . The local government wanted to close its eyes to the problem in hopes it would go away , he says . It did not .\nBefore Refudocs was running , asylum-seekers here received care when doctors were available \u2013 a system that became unworkable amid mounting pressure on service providers across the country . Today some 70 doctors , many retired , share shifts , paid for by the state government , to keep the practice regularly humming .\n\u201c Everyone wants to help for a few weeks . But in the long-term that is not enough , \u201d Wendeborn says . \u201c This problem will accompany us for years , so we must have good standards . \u201d\nWendenborn is convinced Germany will cope , just as his practice is amid record arrivals , most of them through Munich . \u201c Seven thousand people can arrive in the Hauptbahnhof at one moment and it \u2019 s not a problem now , \u201d he says . \u201c Now they have a concept . \u201d\nAnd many are convinced Germany soon will as well . \u201c We are one of the richest countries in the world , why not ? \u201d says Wendeborn \u2019 s colleague Hilda Hadorn , who on this day alone has provided therapy to mothers who have been forced to leave their children behind in Turkey and entire families exhausted and scarred from an interminable trek . \u201c Why not ? \u201d\nBut everyone is clear that Germany can \u2019 t do it alone , and now eyes are turning to Brussels to see how it responds to Germany \u2019 s decision to close its doors temporarily . Will that spur more support for a quota system to redistribute refugees across the EU , seen here as necessary to keeping support for refugees robust ?\nAt the Hauptbahnhof on a recent weekday morning , four trains of asylum-seekers have arrived in the span of an hour . Gunther Wohrle , an engineer , has come by on his bike as he commutes to work .\n\u201c The ideal is to make this a win-win situation , \u201d he says . \u201c They need us , and we need them . \u201d\nBut he admits to a certain skepticism about how to make it work without getting overwhelmed . \u201c One million people , that is a lot of people , \u201d he says of the numbers that could arrive in Germany this year alone .\nThose questions loom large in the communities on the front lines . On a recent day , at the \u201c Friends \u201d center in Elchingen , it is clear that camaraderie has bloomed here . Willbold-Vajagic easily lists off the names of wives and children \u2019 s ages of the refugees that now call Bavaria home . She says that among her hardest personal challenge so far was Ramadan this summer . Not because she fasted , but because \u201c their faces were white , and we saw them getting thinner and thinner , and it was so hot , \u201d she says . \u201c It was terrible . \u201d\nAmar Abo Udeh , from Daraa in Syria and who arrived in Elchingen a year and a half ago , laughs .\nFasting during Ramadan isn \u2019 t hard , he says . But such care is one reason that migrants trekking across Europe , by foot or rail , are chanting , \u201c Germany , Germany , Germany. \u201d \u201c In Daraa , every day you wake up and you don \u2019 t know if you will go to sleep , \u201d he says .\nSara Miller Llana Mayor Joachim Eisenkolb ( l. ) has coffee with two Syrian refugees who say they feel at home in the tiny Bavarian village of Elchingen .\nMayor Joachim Eisenkolb , who fully supports the integration work of the \u201c Friends , \u201d says this town of 9,000 could see 150 more arrivals by the end of the year , or double the current number . When he heard the chancellor \u2019 s welcome of refugees , he admits he felt fear . \u201c Until now , we \u2019 ve been able to soak up these refugees like a sponge , \u201d he says . \u201c But now the sponge is full . \u201d\nHis skepticism is not just a political equation . The volunteers here say they can \u2019 t cope with more numbers either . Everything takes time , space , and organization , including things one hardly thinks of , like having to bring in local police officers to give lessons on riding bikes on Germany \u2019 s roadways .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

It also speeds up court processes for asylum-seekers .\nTechnically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military . However , Associated Press reporters at the border have already spotted heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border in recent days .\nThe announcement on the state of emergency comes as tougher laws also came into effect on Tuesday aimed at preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country . The legislation makes it a crime to try to breach a razor-wire fence along the border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .\nHungarian officials closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia Tuesday morning . The night before , officials deployed a boxcar covered with razor wire to close a key border crossing along a railroad track that had been the main entry point for migrants .\nThere were chaotic scenes at the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , as the Hungarians opened a small temporary office to process people on the edge of no man \u2019 s land and crowds tried to squeeze inside . A first group of about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .\nA group of migrants also blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they will refuse food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary . The sit-in protest is happening on the no man \u2019 s land between Roszke and Horgos , Serbia , which is the main border crossing between the two countries .\nThose who were lucky enough to make it into Hungary the day before were boarding buses . One Hungarian police officer said they were being sent directly to Austria .\nPeople had dashed to make it into the country in recent days , hoping to reach Western Europe before it was too late . A record 9,380 migrants entered Hungary on Monday , beating the previous record of 5,809 set just a day earlier .\nSome 200,000 migrants have entered Hungary so far in 2015 , nearly all by walking across the southern border with Serbia . Almost all , however , simply transit Hungary on their way to Germany or other Western European nations .\nUnder the new laws , most migrants entering the country from Serbia can be turned away because that country is considered safe and could theoretically provide them asylum .\nThe new law also makes it a crime to damage the 4-meter ( 13-foot ) razor-wire fence that Hungary has built on the 110-mile ( 175-kilometer ) border with Serbia , giving police the power to detain anyone trying to breach it .\nThe state of emergency allows the government to mobilize the army \u2014 pending parliamentary approval next week \u2014 to help police with border control , and forces courts to prioritize cases involving migrants caught entering Hungary illegally . Police can enter and search homes where migrants who entered Hungary illegally are believed to be hiding .\nGermany \u2019 s interior minister , Thomas de Maiziere , on Tuesday said he supports the idea of cutting European Union funding to countries that refuse to share the burden of hosting refugees .\nSeveral EU countries , particularly in the former Eastern bloc , have rejected calls from Germany and the EU \u2019 s executive Commission for mandatory quotas to spread refugees out among the 28-nation bloc .\nDe Maiziere told ZDF television that there needs to be discussion of how to exert pressure and that the countries rejecting quotas often receive significant amounts of EU funding .\nHe said that Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested \u2014 \u201c and I find that right \u201d \u2014 that \u201c we should talk about ( them ) getting less money from the structural funds . \u201d", "Boris Johnson faces a fresh pummeling in the Commons today as he tries to win support for a snap General Election .\nA furious Mr Johnson last night called for Britain to go to the polls , handing the future of Brexit back to the public after Remainers seized control of Parliament in a bid to rule out No Deal .\nThe Prime Minister had lost a crunch vote , giving a rebel alliance control of Commons business with the aim of passing a law to stop the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October , by an unexpectedly large margin of 328 to 301 .\nMr Johnson responded seconds later by declaring he will call a snap election , almost certainly on October 15 , however he faces an uphill battle to get his plan through the Commons tonight , as the law dictates that two-thirds of MPs must agree to hold an early election .\nDespite spending years demanding a poll , Jeremy Corbyn said last night that the No Deal legislation must be passed before a snap poll can happen .\nDescribed as the 'mother of all U-turns ' by a Government source , the change of heart was slammed by members of his own party , with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of 'splitting on the working class ' by blocking Brexit .\nSenior Labour sources said Mr Johnson would be left to 'stew in his own juices ' while they decided whether or not to back holding an election . In return , Tories accused Labour of 'running scared ' of the electorate .\nFurious Boris Johnson ( pictured , last night in the Commons ) has called for a snap election after rebel MPs seized control of the house by 328 to 301\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is pictured in the Commons last night after rebel MPs seized control of the house , infuriating the Prime Minister\nYesterday 's victory for pro-EU MPs came despite Mr Johnson threatening to end the careers of Tories who joined the revolt by deselecting them .\nWHAT HAPPENS TODAY ? HOW UK COULD GO TO THE POLLS ON OCT 15 A furious Boris Johnson will today table a Commons motion calling for an early General Election . If only getting it passed was so easy . Mr Johnson 's proposal must be backed by two-thirds of MPs , a requirement under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act to stop Prime Ministers skewing the system by calling elections when their opponents are weak . The motion likely to be debated and voted on in the Commons this evening . But Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will not support it \u2013 hobbling its chances of success \u2013 unless a no-deal Brexit is already taken off the table . Labour fear a 'trap ' whereby Mr Johnson , who can still decide the exact timings of an election after winning the ability to call one , changes the proposed date from October 15 to after October 31 , dissolving Parliament and stopping MPs preventing No Deal from happening . Before any of this can happen , MPs will this afternoon debate taking No Deal off the table \u2013 the move made possible by Mr Johnson 's lost vote last night . If passed , the catchily titled European Union ( Withdrawal ) ( No . 6 ) Bill 2019 would force the Government to ask the EU to delay Brexit until January 31 2020 unless the Commons has agreed a deal by October 19 . No Deal would be off the table , for now . But the Bill would still need to clear all stages in the Commons and the Lords to become law \u2013 a process that should take weeks and at the minimum would take days . It means when Mr Johnson 's election motion is debated later in the day , No Deal will still be on the table \u2013 and barring a change of heart from Labour it is likely to fail . Other options include the government calling a motion of no confidence in itself , or attempting to pass a law that declares the next election must be on a certain date . That would only need support of a majority of MPs . Either way we would be in uncharted territory .\nSome 21 Conservatives - including eight former Cabinet ministers - took part in the mutiny and will now be stripped of the Tory whip , leaving Mr Johnson running a minority government .\nIt was the first vote of Mr Johnson 's premiership . 'Not a good start , Boris ! ' shouted one Labour MP as the result came in .\nSenior figures such as Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond face being brutally ejected from the party in what one government source described as a 'bloodbath ' .\nThat will leave the government an eye-watering 43 MPs short of a majority , and completely unable to control the House . Speaking after the result , Mr Johnson said Parliament was 'on the brink of wrecking ' the Brexit negotiations .\n'The people are going to have to choose , ' he said last night . ' I can confirm tonight we are tabling a motion under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act . '\nThe scale of the Tory rebellion was larger than many had expected at Westminster , with the 'aggressive ' government tactics failing to whittle down numbers .\nThe combative attitude of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg during the debate on the business motion seemed to infuriate many who were wavering .\nThe roll call of rebels included ex-Chancellor Mr Hammond , who has already vowed to fight efforts to deselect him , as well as former ministers Justine Greening and Alistair Burt - who both pre-empted their punishments earlier by announcing they would be standing down at the election .\nOther Cabinet veterans were Sir Oliver Letwin , Dominic Grieve , Mr Clarke , Greg Clark , Rory Stewart , and Caroline Nokes . Sir Nicholas Soames , grandson of Winston Churchill , also rebelled .\nA Downing Street spokesman said last night : 'The Chief Whip is speaking with those Tory MPs who did not vote with the Government this evening . They will have the whip removed . '\nA rebel source said No10 was 'removing the whip from two former chancellors , a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill 's grandson ' .\n'What has has happened to the Conservative Party ?

Leave vote : 48 per cent\nThe bitter Tory civil war exploded after frantic developments yesterday , which saw :\nFormer Tory minister Phillip Lee dramatically stripped the government 's majority by crossing the floor of the chamber to defect to the Lib Dems while Mr Johnson was speaking ;\nMr Johnson was embroiled in a bitter clash with Mr Hammond during 'peace talks ' at No10 during which he accused him of trying to 'hand power over to a Junta that includes Jeremy Corbyn ' ;\nNigel Farage said there will be no Brexit pact with the Tories unless Mr Johnson explicitly adopts No Deal as his policy ;\nOpposition MPs applauded Speaker John Bercow as he ridiculed the Prime Minister 'do or die ' pledge to secure Brexit by October 31 ;\nDowning Street delayed the planned election by a day after being warned that October 14 clashed with a Jewish holiday ;\nBrexiteer peers tabled 90 amendments to the rebel Bill as they geared up to try and filibuster when it reaches the Upper House later this week ;\nAfter the result was declaring in a hushed Commons chamber last night , a clearly angry PM rose to his feet to condemn the decision .\n'Let there be no doubt about the consequences of this vote tonight , ' he said .\n'It means that parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels .\n'Because tomorrow 's Bill would hand control of the negotiations to the EU . And that would mean more dither , more delay , more confusion .\n'And it would mean that the EU themselves would be able decide how long to keep this country In the EU .\nAnd since I refuse to go along with that plan , we are going to have to make a choice .\n' I do n't want an election . The public do n't want an election . But if the House votes for this Bill tomorrow , the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on Oct 17 to sort this out and take this country forward . '\nMr Corbyn said : 'He wants to table a motion for a general election , fine .\n'Get the Bill through first in order to take no deal off the table . '\nDame Margaret Hodge and his shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry appeared to back his position .\nDame Margaret said : ' I will not be supporting a snap general election because it is nothing more than a trap set by the most untrustworthy PM in living memory .\n'This is just part of Johnson 's ploy to get a No Deal Brexit over the line regardless of the disastrous consequences . We must reject it . '\nEmily Thornberry then added : 'There 's not going to be a general election tomorrow , because we 're not going to vote for it . '\nBut Mr Mann was outraged , tweeting : 'Oh these clever people . Let 's spit on the working class and a majority of the electorate . Stop brexit .\n'Then ask them to vote us into power . We are dealing with people who do n't respect the views of the people . '\nEarlier , sources close to shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the party was looking at 'mechanisms ' that could bind the PM to a specific election date .\nChallenged during the debate in the Commons to say he will back an election , Mr Corbyn had again refused to give a straight answer .\n'We are ready for a general election , we are ready to take on this Government and ready to win a General Election to end austerity and poverty across the country , ' he said .\nIn an extraordinary interview , shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry even boasted about blocking a poll .\n' I 'm not sure . We might vote against , we might abstain . It does n't matter , ' she said .\nDuring another day of high drama in Westminster , former minister Phillip Lee crossed the floor in the Commons and joined the Lib Dems .\nAs the PM was struggling to defend his Brexit stance in the chamber , Dr Lee walked away from his colleagues and went to sit with Jo Swinson 's pro-EU party .\nKicking off the debate in Parliament yesterday , former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin insisted that the 'threat ' of No Deal was not a 'credible negotiating strategy ' .\nHe said it was 'decision time ' for MPs and they had to take their 'last chance ' to stop the UK from crashing out .\n'Over the last six weeks the Government has not produced a single indication of any viable proposal to replace the backstop by any alternative likely to prove acceptable to the EU , ' Sir Oliver said .\n'The likelihood of the Government reaching a deal at the council meeting on October 17 and 18 on the terms the Government itself has set is accordingly slight . '\nHe warned this was the last week Parliament will have to block a no-deal exit on October 31 , noting : 'It 's decision time .\n'If MPs across the House want to prevent a no-deal exit on October 31 they will have the opportunity to do so if , but only if , they vote for this motion this evening . '\nBut Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg barely bothered to disguise his anger as he took to the despatch box , saying the business motion tonight was a 'subversion of democracy ' .\nHe also swiped viciously at the Speaker for bending procedures to permit the move .\nMr Bercow was applauded by the House as he boasted about bending Commons rules to trigger a crunch vote .\nAmid fury from Eurosceptics , he insisted he would keep 'facilitating the House of Commons ' .\nIn a reference to Mr Johnson 's solemn 'do or die ' pledge to secure Brexit by Halloween , he said :\n' I 've done it , I am doing it , I will continue to do it to the best of my ability without fear or favour - to coin a phrase , come what may , do or die . '\nIn a statement yesterday , Dr Lee said the 'party I joined in 1992 is not the party I am leaving today ' .\n'This Conservative government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways , ' he said .\nLosing his overall majority is a symbolic blow to the PM , although in reality the Brexit issue has been splitting parties to such an extent that it will not make a big difference to the challenges he faces .\nHowever , Mr Johnson was defiant as he addressed MPs immediately after the extraordinary scenes this afternoon .\nAttacking Remainer plans to seize control of the Commons and pass legislation ruling out No Deal , Mr Johnson said : 'It is Jeremy Corbyn 's surrender bill . '\nIn a stinging barb about the concessions to Brussels he added : 'They would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they like and on their terms . '\nMr Johnson stressed that there will be 'no further pointless delay ' to Brexit . 'Enough is enough . The country wants this done and they want the referendum respected , ' he said .\n'We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal , we will leave by October 31 in all circumstances . '\nPrior to the defection the PM had an effective majority of just one .\nDr Lee switching sides made it a minority government - although the premier can also rely on the support of Charlie Elphicke , who is currently suspended from the Tory whip .\nBut the axing of another 21 MPs who rebelled takes the government a long way into the red .\nPrior to the introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act in 2011 , it would have been impossible for a government to survive in such circumstances .\nBut Mr Johnson 's problem is that Remainers want to wound him , but fear allowing an election would give him an opportunity to force No Deal .\nEarlier , the PM met senior rebels including Mr Hammond and Mr Gauke ahead of the crucial vote .\nBut the discussion quickly descended into acrimony , with government sources accusing Mr Hammond of behaving 'disrespectfully ' and 'chuntering ' .\nThe premier accused the former chancellor during the encounter of 'handing power to a Junta including Jeremy Corbyn ' by backing the anti-No Deal legislation .\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson gloated about the new addition to her ranks . 'Welcome @ DrPhillipLeeMP - you have joined us at the most crucial time .\n' I look forward to working with you to prevent a disastrous Brexit , and to fight for a fairer , more equal society , ' she wrote on Twitter .\nIn a challenge to the PM , Mr Hammond was reselected in Runnymede and Weybridge by executive members of the Conservative Association at a private meeting on Monday night .\nEarlier today he slammed the government 's 'aggressive ' tactics , saying the PM will have the 'fight of a lifetime ' if he tries to deselect him .\nMr Bercow ridiculed Mr Johnson 's 'do or die ' pledge to deliver Brexit by October 31 as he gave a favourable ruling to the Remainer rebels\n' I am going to support the Bill ... I think we have the numbers , ' he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .\nHe also launched an excoriating attack on maverick No10 Brexit chief Dominic Cummings .\n'This is my party , I am going to defend my party against people who are at the heart of this government who care nothing about the future of the Conservative party , ' he said .\nAllies of the PM said the rest of the group were 'civil ' and 'respectful ' during the meeting with the PM , but Mr Hammond 'interrupted ' and 'chuntered ' .\nMr Johnson is said to have made very clear that he 'would not tolerate ' the Bill . Rebels have accused Mr Johnson of using the election to try and 'purge ' Tory opponents of No Deal and turn the party into a Eurosceptic vehicle .\nWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd yesterday warned against taking action against 'very valued colleagues who made a very different choice ' .\n'We should consider carefully the consequences of dividing the party . But I do support the PM in his commitment\u2026 to get a deal , ' she told reporters outside her London home .\nTo take effect the anti-No Deal legislation must clear all its Parliamentary stages and receive Royal Assent before the Houses prorogue for the party conference break - which is due to happen as early as next Monday .\nIn his appearance in the chamber this afternoon , Mr Johnson conceded for the first time that he would be obliged to obey the law if it is passed .\nCorbyn 'running scared ' of a general election Jeremy Corbyn was accused of running scared of a general election last night after Labour suggested it would block one unless a No Deal Brexit had been ruled out . The Labour leader insisted yesterday that he wanted a general election to end austerity . But his party said they would sanction this only if a parliamentary mechanism could be found to prevent a No Deal Brexit . Mr Corbyn indicated Labour would not vote for an election unless a bill to block No Deal had already been passed . Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it would be the 'mother of all U-turns ' if the Labour leader decided not to support an election in the vote , expected today . And Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Leader of the House , said opposition MPs were 'white with fear ' that an election could lead to Mr Corbyn in No 10 . Labour MPs warned their leader not to fall for a 'trap election ' which would still give Mr Johnson the chance to leave the EU without a deal . They are concerned that Mr Johnson will end up reneging on his promise to hold the vote on October 15 , and would instead move it until after October 31 \u2013 denying Parliament the opportunity of preventing No Deal . It has been claimed that Mr Johnson could respond to a defeat on a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act simply by introducing a one-line bill which stated that , notwithstanding the Act , a general election will be held on October 15 . That would need only a simple majority to pass , not a two-thirds one .\n'We will of course uphold the constitution and obey the law , ' he said .\nMs Greening confirmed today that she would not stand for re-election in Putney . 'It 's very clear to me that my concerns about the Conservative party becoming the Brexit party , in effect , have come to pass , ' she told Today .\n'So my decision is that if I really want to make a difference on opportunity and social mobility , I need to do that outside parliament . '\nMr Hammond rejected the idea Downing Street could prevent him from standing as a Tory at the next election .\n' I do n't believe they do and there would certainly be the fight of a lifetime if they tried to , ' he said .\nAsked whether he would be prepared to take such a fight to the courts , he said : 'Possibly . A lot of my colleagues have come under immense pressure . Some have responded to that by saying 'enough , I 'm going ' .\n'That is not going to be my approach . This is my party . I have been a member of this party for 45 years . '\nFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve said : ' I simply do not see the Conservative Party surviving in its current form if we continue behaving like this towards each other .\n'This is now becoming a heavily ideological party being led in a way I do n't identify as being conservative at all . '\nThe primary aim of the so-called European Union ( Withdrawal ) ( No.6 ) Bill 2019 is to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal on October 31 .\nBut it goes much further and demands the PM ask the EU for a Brexit delay to January 31 2020 in the event Britain and Brussels are unable to agree a new deal at an EU Council meeting on October 17 .\nThe Bill states that if the EU does agree to the request for an extension the PM must immediately accept the offer .\nIf the EU propose a different extension date the PM must accept it within two days - unless it is rejected by the House of Commons .\nThe Bill does say that the UK can leave the bloc without a deal but only if MPs explicitly vote in favour of such an outcome .\nPictured : Boris Johnson speaks with arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Commons last night , when the government suffered a blow to their agenda\nThe government last night lost a vote in Westminster which handed control of the House of Commons to an alliance of rebel MPs , leading to calls for a general election from Boris\nThe victory for pro-EU MPs - by a big margin of 328 to 301 - came despite Mr Johnson threatening to end the careers of Tories who joined the revolt by deselecting them\nSajid Javid ( left ) , Boris Johnson ( centre ) , and Dominic Raab ( right ) appeared glum-faced as they left the Commons last night following a defeat for the government\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa was spotted smiling as she left Parliament following a defeat for her successor , Boris Johnson , last night\nJeremy Hunt is pictured , left , leaving the Commons after last night 's vote as Rory Stewart , right , headed home from Parliament after attending the GQ Men of the Year Awards earlier in the evening\nNoisy pro-EU protests were taking place outside the Houses of Parliament as the political drama unfolded last night\nProtesters are pictured outside Parliament last night as Boris Johnson suffered defeat in the Commons and rebel MPs took control in Westminster\nDay the PM lost his majority : Red face for Boris as MP defects as he delivers statement\nTory MP Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the House to join the Liberal Democrats in dramatic fashion yesterday , wiping out Boris Johnson 's Commons majority .\nThe shock move \u2013 which Downing Street had no advance warning of \u2013 happened just hours before the Government lost the crunch Brexit vote by 328-301 .\nBefore Dr Lee 's defection , Mr Johnson only had a working majority of one in the Commons thanks to his deal with the DUP . At a stroke , Dr Lee 's decision turned the Prime Minister 's administration into a minority government of minus one .\nDr Lee , MP for Bracknell , crossed the floor as Mr Johnson delivered a statement to MPs in the wake of the G7 summit yesterday\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson ( left ) looked delighted as she sat alongside Phillip Lee ( right ) after he defected yesterday\nJacob Rees-Mogg takes a lie down in the Commons last night , as Anna Turley MP slammed him for 'the physical embodiment of arrogance , entitlement , disrespect and contempt for our parliament '\nThe defection came just as Mr Johnson prepared to deliver a statement to MPs on the G7 summit , and hours before an alliance of Tory and Opposition MPs attempted to seize control of the Commons ' order paper to prevent a No Deal Brexit .\nFarage says PM must vow 'clean break ' Brexit Nigel Farage today held out the prospect that the Brexit Party could line up behind Boris Johnson in an election - but only if he vows to deliver a 'clean break ' from the EU . The MEP said he was ready to put 'country before party ' and 'help in any way we can ' if a snap poll is triggered . But he warned that the PM seemed 'intent on reheating Theresa May 's Withdrawal Agreement ' and that meant there was no chance of a pact . The intervention came after Mr Johnson pledged to call an election for October 14 if Remainers win a crunch vote last night aiming to block No Deal . The PM said the move would 'chop the legs off ' the goverment 's negotiating strategy , and warned he will never ask Brussels for an extension to the Halloween deadline . But Tory success in a poll could rely on Mr Farage 's Brexit Party not splitting the Eurosceptic vote in key marginal seats .\nThe former justice minister , a prominent supporter of a second EU referendum , said the Government was 'aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways ' .\n'It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the UK , ' he said in a statement .\nDr Lee , a qualified doctor , also said his decision was made after Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg behaved 'disgrace-fully ' to a fellow doctor during a radio-phone row over whether anyone might die as a result of a No Deal Brexit .\nIn his resignation letter to the Prime Minister , Dr Lee claimed Brexit had 'helped to transform this once great party into something more akin to a narrow faction , where an individual 's 'conservatism ' is measured by how recklessly one wishes to leave the EU ' .\nDr Lee later hinted at further defections from the Tories , telling Sky News : ' I guess the elevation of Boris Johnson to the Prime Minister 's position has accelerated events .\n' I do n't think that everybody who 's currently siting as a Conservative is going to be sitting as a Conservative after the next election .\n'Whether they join the Liberal Democrats or not , it 's an individual decision but I really would n't be surprised if more come to this conclusion over the next few days . '\nIn his letter to the Prime Minister , Dr Lee also said the Tories had 'become infected by the twin diseases of English nationalism and populism ' .\nHe told BBC Radio 4 's PM the 'bullying ' of MPs opposed to No Deal showed the 'tone and culture ' of the Conservative Party had fundamentally changed , and he knew of other like-minded colleagues who were also considering their futures . Dr Lee 's decision to cross the floor was greeted with cheers on the opposition benches .\nFormer PM Theresa May positioned herself alongside Tory Remainer Ken Clarke for the statement yesterday and appeared to be enjoying Mr Johnson 's discomfort\nBut last night former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith criticised Dr Lee . 'It looked like [ Dr Lee ] should be joining RADA [ Royal Academy of Dramatic Art ] ... The whole thing was stage-managed , ' he said .\n'It 's pretty deceitful if you move from one party to the next , when the British people voted for you and you were supported by the Conservative Party , its money and its organisation . '\nThe MP 's defection wipes out the Tory-DUP majority , though suspended Dover MP Charlie Elphicke is expected to vote with the Government . It also brings the number of Lib Dem MPs to 15 after his fellow former Tory MP Sarah Wollaston joined the party last month .\nFormer ministers Justine Greening and Alistair Burt also said yesterday that they would not seek re-election as Conservatives in the next general election , expected in weeks .\nAnd Tory MP Keith Simpson said he was stepping aside , though said it was to do with his turning 70 , rather than Brexit . Announcing her decision to stand down as a Tory MP at the next election yesterday , Miss Greening , the former education secretary , said the Prime Minister was 'narrowing down ' the Tories ' appeal to the public .\nShe vowed to support a rebel bill tabled by Labour 's Hilary Benn to force Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline .\nSecond referendum-backer Miss Greening said her fears that the Tory Party would morph into Nigel Farage 's Brexit Party had 'come to pass ' .\nThe Conservative Party rebel told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Prime Minister was offering the country a 'lose-lose ' situation by threatening a general election .\nExplosion of loathing at No10 : From ex-Chancellor 's savage attack on Boris 's Brexit tactics to PM thumping Cabinet table , the incendiary row that led to Tory defeat\nIf Boris Johnson woke up yesterday thinking the prospect of an early election , combined with his threat to deselect Tory MPs who try to thwart his Brexit plans , would cow the rebels , he was swiftly disabused of the notion yesterday morning .\nAt 8.10am on Radio 4 's Today Programme , Philip Hammond \u2013 22 years a Tory MP , a former defence and foreign secretary and until a few short weeks ago Chancellor of the Exchequer \u2013 was defiant .\nNot only would he vote for a Labour-backed Bill designed to stop No Deal and force Mr Johnson to ask for a three-month extension to Article 50 , but he believed the rebels had the numbers to force the controversial legislation through .\nTaking clear aim at Mr Johnson 's de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings , he added : ' I am going to defend my party against incomers , entryists , who are trying to turn it from a broad church to narrow faction .\nBoris Johnson first PM to be defeated in first Commons vote in 236 years Last night , Tory rebels handed Boris Johnson a humiliating defeat , leading one MP to shout : 'Not a good start , Boris . ' He became the first Prime Minister to be defeated on his first Commons vote in 236 years . King George III dismissed the government of Lord North and Charles James Fox in , who had the support of MPs in 1783 . Controversially he appointed Pitt the Younger at the end of 1783 , as First Minister . The 24-year-old managed to form a government , but was unable to pass any legislation , in a situation that mirrors the conundrum faced by Mr Johnson in the present day . But unlike Mr Johnson , Pitt did not call for an election straight away , fearing a possible loss . Instead he waited in government , mobilised public opinion and eroded the opposition in the Commons by giving peerages to Fox 's MPs . Then he called for an election early the next year , in 1784 , and secured a dominant majority .\n'People who are at the heart of this Government , who are probably not even members of the Conservative Party , who care nothing about the future of the Conservative Party , I intend to defend my party against them . '\nLast night 's vote set the seal on a battle that raged around the Palace of Westminster yesterday on what , it is no exaggeration to say , was one of yet another of those extraordinary and exhausting political days .\nAt the start of the day , the number of Tories publicly committed to rebellion was in the single figures . If Downing Street could keep the numbers down , there was at least some hope of averting defeat .\nBoth in public and private , No 10 aides condemned a law they called a 'blueprint for legislative purgatory ' , which would cost taxpayers \u00a31billion a month , which was 'very clearly in Brussels ' interests not in the British interest ' . One , invoking the kind of classical allusion enjoyed by Mr Johnson , called it 'the worst terms since Rome and the Carthaginians ' .\nThe Romans took Carthage , killed most of the inhabitants , sold the rest into slavery and destroyed the city . Just before 10.15am , around 15 rebels entered Downing Street .\nNobody was calling them peace talks , and by the end it was clear they had only served to expose the Brexit civil war tearing the Conservative Party apart .\nOne attendee described it as 'the most extraordinary meeting I have ever been in ' . The rebel group included former Chancellor Philip Hammond , former justice secretary David Gauke and ex-business secretary Greg Clark \u2013 as well as a raft of former junior ministers and senior backbenchers including Sir Nicholas Soames , the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill .\nThe meeting was held in the Cabinet room , around which many of the rebels had sat as ministers only weeks earlier .\nOn the Prime Minister 's left sat Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd who has urged him not to pull the trigger on the rebels but to 'hold our party together ' .\nThe Prime Minister began by arguing that progress was being made with the EU , and the threat of No Deal was having a real impact on Brussels .\nRebels including ( left to right ) Stephen Hammond , Antionette Sandbach , Richard Benyon , Margot James and Nicholas Soames walked out of Downing Street after a tense discussion with Mr Johnson\nIf the Bill was to pass , he argued , it could result in a second referendum or even the revocation of Article 50 \u2013 the death of Brexit . And he made clear to the rebels that , yes , they really would lose the whip if they did not back down .\nFrom his seat in the corner , next to Mr Gauke and Michael Gove , Mr Hammond could n't hide his displeasure . In truth , he argued , No 10 did n't have a negotiating strategy or even team in place .\nThey were n't really trying to get a deal . Even if Mr Johnson could secure a last-ditch deal at the European Council on October 17 , there was n't time to pass the required legislation ahead of Brexit day on October 31 , he insisted .\nNo , Mr Johnson said , there was in fact time . What 's more , he said , there would also be time for the rebels to try again to stop No Deal after the Council .\nTory rebels including David Gauke ( left ) and Philip Hammond ( right ) looked grim-faced after leaving their talks with the PM yesterday . Sources said Mr Hammond had been 'disrespectful '\nBut Mr Hammond was n't listening . 'Hammond and Boris were just refusing to listen to one another . Hammond kept talking over him , tutting and shaking his head , ' one source said . 'Boris was doing the same . '\nAt one point the exasperated PM declared : 'You all just want to keep us in the EU . ' Hammond hit back : 'We voted for the deal three times . ' The row escalated .\nPM : ' I will not tolerate a Bill that hands over power to Corbyn . ' Hammond : 'We are handing over power to Parliament . ' PM : 'You are handing power over to a junta that includes Jeremy Corbyn . '\nHe added : 'Extension [ of Article 50 ] would be an extinction-level event for the Conservative Party . ' 'Their mutual loathing was very apparent , ' a source told me .\nDominic Cummings was not present throughout the meeting , but had spoken to a group of rebels waiting outside . One later accused him of 'hectoring ' them and starting a row , a claim denied by Government sources . ' I 've seen Dom argue and it was not a Dom argument ' .\nDominic Cummings ( pictured with Mr Johnson at Downing Street yesterday ) is believed to be masterminding the Brexit strategy\nHe did , though , make one short cameo appearance in the room , described as 'deliberate trolling ' of the rebels . 'Dom turned up just to needle Hammond . ' ( Insiders also say that while they were waiting for the meeting to start Mr Cummings had told the waiting rebel MPs : ' I do n't know who any of you are ! ' )\nOne hour and 25 minutes after the meeting began , Mr Johnson banged the table , urged the rebels to 'trust my position ' and the meeting was over . The PM concluded : ' I assume everyone is with me . ' It would quickly become clear they were not . Then the briefing war began . Government sources accused Mr Hammond of having mentioned EU 'legal advice ' in a discussion about the extension .\nHad he unwittingly revealed his connivance with the enemy in Brussels ? No , rebel sources insisted . A Hammond spokesman called the claim 'ridiculous and categorically untrue ' . He was simply citing the 'established view of the EU legal service ' .\nNo 10 was not convinced . Rebels accused Mr Johnson of offering an 'unconvincing ' account of how he would pass a deal and providing 'no convincing proof ' that a negotiation is even taking place .\nAs that meeting finished , another began in the parliamentary offices of Jeremy Corbyn where the Labour leader and other opposition parties agreed to back the Bill . No such clarity , however , on whether to back an election .\nDuring the morning and early afternoon , the number of confirmed rebels began to tick up . Former minister Sam Gyimah and Sir Nicholas both confirmed they would be voting against the Government . Yet some still had hope .\nAt lunchtime , Tory chief whip Mark Spencer told junior ministers that Labour Leavers could come to the rescue , with somewhere between three and ten prepared to vote with the Government .\nBut by the time the Commons began sitting at 2.30pm the number of publicly declared rebels was up to 15 and several more were still making up their minds . What was n't expected was Tory Phillip Lee 's public defection to the Lib Dems . When Mr Johnson stood up to make his Commons statement on the G7 , Dr Lee stood up and crossed the floor of the House to sit with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and at a stroke he erased Mr Johnson 's majority .\nTory MPs were deflated . Only when Mr Johnson baited Jeremy Corbyn with accusations of 'surrender ' did they cheer up .\nSir Oliver Letwin ( pictured standing right ) was surrounded by fellow Remainer rebels including Philip Hammond ( front left ) as he kicked off the debate last night , insisting that the 'threat ' of No Deal was not a 'credible negotiating strategy '\nIn the briefing for journalists afterwards , Mr Cummings popped up again , in the background , refusing to answer questions on whether he was a member of the Tory party . At a little after 6.30pm , it took barely a minute for leading rebel Sir Oliver Letwin to set out his unprecedented proposal to take control of the House away from the Government , and for the Speaker John Bercow to agree it should be discussed . The fix was on . The House was in uproar .\nAt one point , the Speaker openly mocked the Prime Minister by throwing a Brexit quote back in his face . To applause from Labour MPs he said he would 'facilitate ' the House of Commons 'come what may , do or die ' .\nMr Hammond was n't finished , though . Standing in central lobby with the vote only hours away , he spoke of his 'outrage ' that the party he has been a member of for 45 years was 'thinking of throwing me out ' .\n'Some of my colleagues have chosen to call it a day because they do n't like what 's going on . My approach is to stay and fight and I will fight for the party I joined and the party that I believe the Conservatives must be , a broad inclusive centre-Right party , for as long as I am able to do so , ' he said . Backing down ? Not a chance .", "( CNN ) -- Did waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques that were used on al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody eventually lead to the Navy SEAL operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan early in the morning of May 2 , 2011 ?\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday has a simple answer to that : Hell , no !\nAccording to the Senate report , the critical pieces of information that led to discovering the identity of the bin Laden courier , Ahmed al-Kuwaiti , ( Ahmed the Kuwaiti ) whose activities eventually pointed the CIA to bin Laden 's hiding place in Pakistan , were provided by an al-Qaeda detainee before he was subjected to CIA coercive interrogation , and was based also upon information that was provided by detainees that were held in the custody of foreign governments . ( The report is silent on the interesting question of whether any of these unnamed foreign governments obtained any of their information by using torture . )\nFurther critical information about the Kuwaiti was also provided by conventional intelligence techniques and was not elicited by the interrogations of any of the CIA detainees , according to the report .\nEven worse for the CIA -- which has consistently defended the supposed utility of the interrogation program , including in the hunt for bin Laden -- a number of CIA prisoners who were subjected to coercive interrogations consistently provided misleading information designed to wave away CIA interrogators from the bin Laden courier who would eventually prove to be the key to finding al Qaeda 's leader .\nThe Senate report provides the fullest accounting so far of the exact sequence of intelligence breaks that led the CIA to determine that the courier , the Kuwaiti , was likely to be living with bin Laden in Pakistan .\nThis reads more like a careful Agatha Christie detective story than a story about the efficacy of coercive interrogations , which some have characterized as torture .\nThe report points out that the courier was in touch with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the operational commander of the 9/11 attacks , and that it was SIGINT ( signals intelligence ) from phones and email traffic that made this link first in 2002 , well before any CIA detainees made such a connection .\nIndeed , in a fascinating footnote , the report makes the case that it was `` voice cuts '' of the courier that were first collected in 2002 that were matched eight years later to the Kuwaiti and were `` geolocated '' to an area of Pakistan in 2010 where he was traveling around . This was a crucial lead that helped prompt the CIA to examine the mysterious compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan , where bin Laden was hiding .\nIn 2002 , reports from four different detainees held by foreign governments provided important information about the courier 's age , physical appearance and family , information that was also acquired prior to any information about the courier being obtained from CIA detainees . Detainees held by foreign governments also said that the courier was close to bin Laden .\nIt was Hassan Ghul , an al Qaeda operative captured in Iraqi Kurdistan , who provided the most detailed account of bin Laden 's courier and his relationship to bin Laden in January 2004 , before he entered CIA custody .\nAccording to a CIA official cited in the report , Ghul , who was in Kurdish custody , `` sang like a tweetie bird . He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset . ''\nGhul described the courier as bin Laden 's `` closest assistant '' and `` one of three individuals likely to be with '' al Qaeda 's leader . And he correctly surmised that bin Laden would have minimal security and `` likely lived in a house with a family somewhere in Pakistan . ''\nIf there was good intelligence coming from sources that were not in CIA custody , the Senate report demonstrates that the detainees who were in CIA custody and were subjected to coercive interrogations made every effort to hide the significance of bin Laden 's courier .\nFive of the most senior al-Qaeda detainees in CIA custody , all of whom were subjected to some of the most intensive coercive interrogation techniques , variously said that the courier worked only with low level members of al Qaeda ; that he was not a courier for bin Laden ; that he was n't close to al Qaeda 's leader , and that he was focused only on his family following his marriage in 2002 . None of this , of course , was true .\nThe CIA , of course , is not happy about the portrayal of its work in the Senate report , and in a rebuttal on its website on Tuesday the agency pushed back , saying that detainees `` in combination with other streams of intelligence '' played a role in finding bin Laden .\nIn particular the CIA cites a detainee , Ammar al-Baluchi , who was coercively interrogated and provided what it terms the first information indicating that the Kuwaiti was indeed bin Laden 's courier , rather than just someone who was an ordinary member of al Qaeda .\nThe CIA rebuttal is not , however as persuasive as the very detailed history laid out in the Senate report , which is buttressed by copious source notes .\nAnd , in any event , were interrogations of al Qaeda detainees really the key to how bin Laden ultimately was found ? After all , it still took almost a decade after the first identification of the courier to find bin Laden .\nIndeed , there were a number of key breaks that had little to do with the interrogations of al Qaeda detainees , which I discovered in the course of reporting my book `` Manhunt . ''\nA large break , according to U.S. counterterrorism officials , came in 2007 , when a foreign intelligence service that they wo n't identify told the CIA that the Kuwaiti 's real name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed .\nIt would still take three more years for the CIA to find Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed in Pakistan , a country with a population of 180 million . This involved painstaking work going through reams of phone conversations to try to locate him through his family and circle of associates .\nIn June 2010 , the Kuwaiti and his brother both made changes in the way they communicated on cell phone , which suddenly opened up the possibility of the `` geolocation '' of both their phones , according to U.S. counterterrorism officials .\nFinally , sometime in the late summer of 2010 , the Kuwaiti received a call from an old friend in the Persian Gulf , a man whom U.S. intelligence officials were monitoring . `` We 've missed you . Where have you been ? '' asked the friend . The Kuwaiti responded elliptically . `` I 'm back with the people I was with before . '' There was a tense pause in the conversation as the friend mulled over that response . Likely realizing that the Kuwaiti was back in bin Laden 's inner circle , the caller replied after some hesitation , `` May God facilitate . ''\nThe CIA took this call as a confirmation that the Kuwaiti was still working with al Qaeda , a matter that officials were still not entirely sure about .\nThe National Security Agency was listening to this exchange and through geolocation technologies was able to zero in on the Kuwaiti 's cell phone in northwestern Pakistan . But the Kuwaiti practiced rigorous operational security and was always careful to insert the battery in his phone and turn it on only when he was at least an hour 's drive away from the Abbottabad compound where he and bin Laden were living . To find out where the Kuwaiti lived by monitoring his cell phone would only go so far .\nIn August 2010 , a Pakistani `` asset '' working for the CIA tracked the Kuwaiti to the crowded city of Peshawar , where bin Laden had founded al Qaeda more than two decades earlier . In the years when bin Laden was residing in the Abbottabad compound , the Kuwaiti would regularly transit though Peshawar , as it is the gateway to the Pakistani tribal regions where al Qaeda had regrouped in the years after 9/11 .\nOnce the CIA asset had identified the Kuwaiti 's distinctive white Suzuki SUV with a spare tire on its back in Peshawar , the CIA was able to follow him as he drove home to Abbottabad , more than two hours ' drive to the east .\nThe large compound where the Kuwaiti finally alighted immediately drew interest at the agency because it did n't have phone or Internet service , which implied its owners wanted to stay off the grid .\nSoon , some CIA officials would come to believe that bin Laden himself was living there .", "Meet Gina , a spy for over 30 years , a devoted public servant and a devotee of Johnny Cash . \u201c She \u2019 s dedicated her life to protecting our nation. \u201d Meet Gina , a spy for over 30 years , an overseer of torture , and a destroyer of valuable documents . \u201c She believes that waterboarding should be something that we use. \u201d This is Gina Haspel , the nominee to head the C.I.A . with two distinct storylines about her . A C.I.A . P.R . blitz aimed at bolstering her nomination tells us most of what we know about Haspel . \u201c Gina Haspel is the best prepared person ever to be nominated for this job. \u201d \u201c A nonpartisan person. \u201d \u201c She \u2019 s got a spine of steel. \u201d \u201c Her only goal is to live out the agency \u2019 s mission. \u201d The C.I.A . tells us that she joined towards the end of the Cold War . She wanted adventure and meaning in her life . We don \u2019 t get too much detail . We know she first deployed to Africa , then later overseas during the Gulf War . At one point she helped catch two terrorists linked to an embassy bombing . They don \u2019 t say where . But pretty much everything else about her 33 years at the agency is classified . And all the while , the C.I.A . says she remained a big fan of her alma mater \u2019 s basketball team : the University of Kentucky Wildcats . Now critics of Haspel are more concerned with what the C.I.A . isn \u2019 t saying about her . \u201c America shouldn \u2019 t be known for torture. \u201d \u201c She was supportive of the program. \u201d \u201c A cover-up from A to Z. \u201d \u201c A dirty past. \u201d After 9/11 . she managed a secret C.I.A . prison in Thailand . And at that prison she oversaw the torture of a detainee . And then , later , she helped execute an order to destroy videotapes of brutal interrogations . Here \u2019 s her then-boss explaining why he didn \u2019 t want the tapes kept : \u201c It would make the C.I.A . look bad. \u201d And it would actually , in my view , it almost destroyed the clandestine service because of it. \u201d The president decided to focus on \u2018 good Gina. \u2019 Gina the trailblazer . \u201c Gina , by the way , who I know very well \u2013 who I worked very closely with ... \u201d will be the first woman director of the C.I.A. \u201d Critics worry that the president \u2019 s embrace of torture won \u2019 t get any pushback from Haspel . \u201c What do you think about waterboarding , Mr. Trump ? \u201d \u201c I said , I love it. \u201d \u201c And I \u2019 d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. \u201d \u201c Torture works , O.K. , folks. \u201d Haspel recently gave a very rare public appearance on Capitol Hill .

She smiled and appeared approachable , more public servant than controversial public official .", "CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell is stepping down and being replaced by White House lawyer Avril Haines , who will be the first woman to hold the post .\nWhen President Barack Obama named a successor to former CIA Director David Petraeus in January , Morell was passed over in favor of the White House counterterrorism adviser , John Brennan . Morell had been acting director since Petraeus ' resignation .\nMorell , 54 , announced his retirement Wednesday , saying he will leave his CIA post Aug. 9 . The White House announced he has been appointed to the President 's Intelligence Advisory Board , a group of mostly retired intelligence officers who advise the president on intelligence policy .\n`` While I have given everything I have to the Central Intelligence Agency and its vital mission for a third of a century , it is now time for me to give everything I have to my family , '' Morell said in a statement released Wednesday by the agency .\nMorell is retiring after 33 years at the CIA , including two stints as acting director \u2014 during the last stint he managed the fallout inside the agency after Petraeus resigned over an extramarital affair . Morell ordered an internal investigation into his former boss ' conduct that is ongoing .\n`` I was most looking forward to ... the opportunity to work side-by-side once again with Michael Morell , '' said Brennan , noting that they 'd begun their careers at the CIA in 1980 . `` As much as I would selfishly like to keep Michael right where he is for as long as possible , he has decided to retire to spend more time with his family and to pursue other professional opportunities . ''\nHaines , 43 , has been a White House deputy assistant and deputy counsel for national security affairs since 2010 . Before that , she was assistant legal adviser for treaty affairs at the State Department , according to a White House statement .\nHaines had been nominated to serve as the State Department 's legal adviser earlier this year , but Brennan chose her for the deputy post when Morell made clear that he was retiring .\nBrennan said that Haines had participated in virtually every senior-level meeting at the president 's National Security Council over the past two years and chairs the White House legal team that reviews the CIA 's most sensitive programs .\n`` In every instance , Avril 's command of substance , sense of mission , good judgment , and keen insights have been outstanding , '' Brennan said in his statement announcing the personnel changes .\nMorell bore the brunt of defending before Congress the CIA 's performance after the attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi , Libya , last September , which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans .\n`` Each time , his testimony has been thorough and forthright , '' said the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. C.A . Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland .\nMorell did the final edit of the controversial `` talking points '' memo meant to describe to the public what happened in that attack . Emails exchanged by administration officials that week show Morell deleted references to the CIA warning the State Department of previous militant attacks in Benghazi .\nU.N . Ambassador Susan Rice used those notes on Sunday talk shows , triggering a controversy in which House Republicans accuse the administration of covering up any connections to terror groups in the attack during the presidential campaign .\nRice was named national security adviser last week , replacing long-serving staffer Tom Donilon as part of the Obama administration 's second-term turnover of its national security team .\nMorell also put himself on a political collision course with the White House and top Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee by publicly defending the results of harsh CIA interrogation techniques like waterboarding while not defending the techniques themselves . Morell had said in a statement to CIA employees that while the film `` Zero Dark Thirty '' was wrong to depict harsh techniques as key to finding Osama bin Laden , those interrogations did produce some useful intelligence .\n`` Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques , but there were many other sources as well , '' Morell said .\nA Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the CIA 's detainee interrogation program completed last December concluded that interrogation methods such as waterboarding , which simulates drowning , produced no useful intelligence . And Morell 's new boss , Brennan , told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing that after reading a summary of that report , he is now not sure those techniques produced any useful information .\nBrennan further called the use of such techniques during the George W. Bush administration `` something that is reprehensible and should never be done again . ''\nMorell 's defense of the program won him many backers at agency headquarters at Langley , Va .\n`` Morell is beloved in the building , '' former House Intelligence Committee member Jane Harman said Wednesday . `` But it will be nice to have a woman in the job .

Before all sides can hash out their differences , there must be an understanding of what their words mean .\nFrom the months following 9/11 right up to the current CIA confirmation hearings for Gina Haspel , the misuse of a vital term has hindered clarity and progress on a key issue . On the first day of her answers before the Senate Intelligence Committee , the word even impeded what should be a clear path to the title she seeks .\nSince our nation began undertaking special lengths to extract vital intelligence from high-value detainees , the questions have reverberated : \u201c Does America torture ? \u201d \u201c Do we approve of torture ? \u201d \u201c Does torture work ? \u201d\nThe crucial error has been defining lawful and justifiable questioning techniques as \u201c torture , \u201d a term that denotes abuse of power , motivated by a desire to punish , or even by sadistic satisfaction .\nThe opponents of enhanced interrogation will affix the term to American practices in order to discredit them . Sadly , even defenders of these valuable procedures have allowed themselves to be dragged into absurd arenas of debate in which they \u201c defend torture . \u201d\nThere is no defense for torture , as properly defined . It is what the North Vietnamese did to our soldiers in Hanoi . It is what drug cartels do to captured enemies . It is what North Korea did to Otto Warmbier . It is not what American intelligence officers have done to save lives .\nIf this seems like an assertion that it \u2019 s not torture if we do it , that is precisely my point -- as long as our intentions remain noble , our behaviors clearly defined , and the practices closely supervised . \u201c Torture \u201d has always had a negative connotation presuming a sinister motivation . This is the exact opposite of what Haspel and the CIA have been about , and it is an offense to logic to continue labeling our practices as such .\nOne may favor or oppose sleep deprivation , cramped confinement or waterboarding , but these practices and others were employed in the cases of carefully screened detainees in an attempt to secure information vital to defeating jihadists and saving lives .\nWaterboarding has always been a particularly ill fit for torture designation . It is not torture if we do it to our own people . I have spoken to special forces veterans who endured the practice in training , so as to better brace for it if captured . One told me : \u201c It \u2019 s hell while it \u2019 s happening , but twenty minutes later I was drinking a cup of coffee without a mark on me . \u201d\nIt may be tempting to invoke the views of John McCain , who was indeed tortured by the North Vietnamese . Today , he unfortunately equates that horror to what his fellow Americans honorably did to serve our nation as he has done .\nSo where do I get off questioning McCain \u2019 s view on the subject ? I rest on two answers , one broad , one specific . The broad anecdotal testimony is the nearly two decades I have spent speaking to veterans and active duty military , on and off the radio . They do not unanimously support enhanced interrogations , but I can count on one hand those who have shared the McCain view that we are torturers .\nThe specific voice I rely on the most is Rep. Sam Johnson ( R-TX ) , retiring after nearly 30 years in Congress and his own seven years in the Hanoi Hilton . Like McCain , he was brutally tortured by the North Vietnamese . Unlike McCain , he did not return to America with the willingness to smear our post-9/11 war effort with such harsh criticism .\nIn answering questions Wednesday , Haspel seemed to stub her toe on this years-long mischaracterization of CIA techniques as torture . Under fire from disapproving Democrats , she revealed that she would not oversee a return to such procedures , even under a lawful order from the President : \u201c I support the higher moral standard that this country has decided to hold itself to . I would never , ever take CIA back to an interrogation program , \u201d she said .\nCount me among those who have strongly supported Haspel \u2019 s nomination . But more importantly , count me among those who would expect her to follow lawful orders from the Commander-in-Chief without bogging the nation down in needless moments of introspection .\nOur discourse will be unburdened if we can resist attempts to hijack the language for political gain . The left must be congratulated for its multiple successes . Abortion is \u201c reproductive freedom , \u201d confiscatory taxation is \u201c investment \u201d and enhanced interrogations are torture .\nOpponents of such practices are free to characterize them as unduly harsh , unnecessary , discordant with \u201c American values , \u201d or whatever . I would disagree on all counts , but those are matters of opinion .\nTo fine-tune a famous Daniel Patrick Moynihan quote , we are entitled to our own opinions ; we are not entitled to redefine words . Once we free ourselves from the years of miscast debate over American \u201c torture , \u201d we can honestly argue the pros and cons of how our nation has extracted intelligence from certain sources .\nAnd who knows ? Once we stop surrendering to the language of the CIA \u2019 s detractors , even its future director might rethink her contrived objections to orders she may one day receive .", "WikiLeaks on Tuesday released what it said is the full hacking capacity of the CIA in a stunning 8,000-plus page disclosure the anti-secrecy website contends is \u201c the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency . \u201d\nThe 8,761 documents and files -- released as \u201c Vault 7 Part 1 \u201d and titled \u201c Year Zero \u201d -- were obtained from an \u201c isolated , high-security network \u201d at the CIA \u2019 s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley , Va. , a press release from the website said .

James Alex Fields Jr. , a then-20-year-old white nationalist from Ohio , has been charged with first degree murder .\nSeparately , two Virginia state police officers monitoring events from the air were killed when their helicopter crashed .\nThe backlash came quickly . Numerous lawsuits , still pending , were filed against the organizers , including Kessler and Spencer , who are accused of promoting violence . And the giants of the technology world \u2014 Facebook , Google , Twitter and YouTube \u2014 also intervened in an effort to cull racist voices from their platforms .\n\u201c That \u2019 s probably been one of the most damaging things that \u2019 s happened to the movement in the last couple years , \u201d said Hankes . \u201c They can \u2019 t disseminate propaganda as easily [ and ] it \u2019 s a lot harder to raise money . \u201d\nBlack , of Stormfront , confirmed the trend .

Kessler has taken steps to avoid a repeat of last year \u2019 s violence , prohibiting shields , weapons of any kind and \u201c non-approved flags , \u201d all of which were featured elements of the Charlottesville marches . American and Confederate flags , however , are welcome .\nTorches , another prominent feature of the Charlottesville marches , are also forbidden , given the National Park Service \u2019 s ban on fire in Lafayette Square .\n\u201c No fire allowed , \u201d Kessler wrote on Facebook in May , in a post obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) . \u201c We need to forget about the torch thing . \u201d\nPeter Montgomery , an expert on right-wing extremism at the liberal advocacy group People For the American Way , said the changes reflect a rebranding effort on the part of some white nationalists following \u201c a real blow to their public relations \u201d with the death of Heyer .\n\u201c You had people who wanted to disassociate themselves from who they saw as more embarrassing manifestations \u2014 people who come to these rallies holding Nazi signs and swastikas , \u201d he said . \u201c There \u2019 s a part of the movement that wants to be a kinder gentler face of the alt-right , but as a result it \u2019 s kind of splintered . \u201d\nUnite the Right 2 organizers did not respond to questions posed through the rally \u2019 s website .

More than 600 of those were associated with the white nationalist movement .\nAnti-hate groups are quick to warn that whatever troubles white nationalists are facing , those political conditions remain . Indeed , a number of Republican candidates with nationalistic , if not outwardly racist views , are running for House and Senate seats this cycle , including Arthur Jones in Illinois , Seth Grossman in New Jersey and Paul Nehlen in Wisconsin .\nTrump has endorsed Virginia Senate GOP nominee Corey Stewart , a controversial figure who is a vocal supporter of Confederate heritage and has said the Civil War was not ultimately fought over slavery . The National Republican Senatorial Committee has not pledged support for Stewart .\n\u201c In that big-picture sense , Trump \u2019 s campaign really electrified and energized white nationalists who had been quite marginalized in American political discourse , \u201d Montgomery said . \u201c He really opened up space for them to move more into the political conversation . And they \u2019 ve taken advantage of that . \u201d\nSophie Bjork-James , an anthropologist at Vanderbilt University who has researched the white supremacist movement , agreed , saying \u201c both sides have been galvanized \u201d since the Charlottesville clashes .\n\u201c While there is an increased organized response against white nationalism , many in the movement still feel emboldened by the broader political climate and are trying to use anti-immigrant sentiment as a recruitment tool , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHankes , of the SPLC , said white nationalists aren \u2019 t bowing out post-Charlottesville , even though they may be rethinking their tactics .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s had a chilling effect ; I think basically they \u2019 re being more careful , \u201d he said . \u201c What was illustrated to me very clearly \u2026 last year is they had more to lose than they thought . \u201d", "More than 45 million Americans live under the poverty line , and roughly 30 million more are near-poor ( defined as 1 to 1.5 times the poverty line ) , according to the latest Census Bureau data .\nthinking about poverty as being only about income levels obscures the important dimension of income uncertainty\nPoverty , of course , is determined simply by figuring out who earns below a certain threshold . Leaving aside the obvious problems with how we calculate that threshold , thinking about poverty in this way also obscures an important dimension of what it means to be low-income : uncertainty .\nAs author Linda Tirado explained to \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week , being poor is n't just about money being tight ; it 's about an inability to plan for the future . Volatile income wreaks havoc on finances as workers hope each month goes perfectly , both when it comes to money inflows and outflows . In a passage from her upcoming book `` Hand to Mouth , '' she tells about her life among the working poor :\n`` If I 'm saving my spare $ 5 a week , in the best-case scenario I will have saved $ 260 a year . ... Of course , you will never manage to actually save it ; you 'll get sick at least one day and miss work and dip into it for rent , '' she writes . Or any other litany of misfortunes could strike , she adds : high gas prices , work pants could tear and need replacing . And those sorts of things will almost certainly happen several times per year , which can easily deplete any sort of savings .\nIn other words , it 's not just about how much you 'll put on your tax return ; it 's about how much you 'll get in your next paycheck and the one after that , and what emergencies that money might have to cover .\nAnd that sentiment is borne out by recent research . According to the US Financial Diaries Project ( whose research on savings circles I highlighted yesterday ) , which follows the spending and savings habits of 200 low-to-moderate-income households over the course of a year , volatility makes life much harder . One of their reports from 2013 shows just how this looks more specifically for struggling families . Here 's a look at two different months ' income for one Kentucky family where the mother ( `` Molly '' in the charts below ) works in a school cafeteria and does n't get any income in the summer months .\nMolly may in fact be lucky , because her job is at least regular , despite the three-month summer gaps . The real troubles are for the many people who have temporary or seasonal jobs . Up and down the spectrum of one sample of low-to-moderate-income households , the project found that incomes could swing widely for various jobs .\nThis is n't a representative sample of Americans , but it does illustrate that many of these people 's jobs leave them guessing each month about how they will fare .\nThere 's other evidence of this as well . Fully 20 percent of Americans in the bottom quintile of earners experienced an income drop of 50 percent or more within a year , according to a 2010 paper from the Urban Institute . That 's not a huge share of Americans , but it is a higher share than for any other quintile , and those swings are likely to be more meaningful for a poorer family .\nWhat any of this information means is that poverty is a much more complex phenomenon than it may seem on the surface , and that fixing it might be a question of targeted policies like the EITC and a higher minimum wage , but also simply of boosting the economy to create better , steadier jobs .", "The places that have the very highest rates of mobility for black men , like Boston , actually have lower rates of upward mobility than the very worst places of upward mobility for white men , like Charlotte .\nChetty 's research showed that job growth and investment happening in Charlotte and Atlanta , for example , are n't creating opportunities evenly , and black male youths are disproportionately being left behind .\nWhat they did : The researchers analyzed outcomes of about 4 million families that moved across neighborhoods and tracked the outcomes of children of low-income parents over 30 years .\nWhat they found : Childhood environments are stronger indicators of upward mobility than where individuals go to college or move as young adults .\nMoving to a better neighborhood at a very young age correlated with much stronger upward mobility as adults . In fact , every extra year of exposure to better childhood environments improved outcomes .\nDownward mobility is also critical . White men from affluent families are likely to stay affluent as adults . But black men from affluent backgrounds are nearly just as likely to end up in the bottom tier of the income distribution than the top tier .\n`` If you think of achieving the American dream as climbing an income ladder for white Americans , it \u2019 s more like being on a treadmill for black Americans . Even after you 've made the climb up in one generation , there are tremendous structural forces that tend to push you back down in the next generation and you have to make the climb again . ''\n\u2014 Raj Chetty , speaking at the Results for America Summit in Washington , D.C .\nAnd the disparities are likely to worsen over the next decade .\nBy 2030 , African American workers stand to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs as a result of increased automation , widening the racial wealth gap and weighing down overall U.S. growth , according to a report from McKinsey & Co .\nThe bottom line : A strong national economy only goes so far . The most important factor in determining upward mobility is the conditions in the half-mile radius around where you live , Chetty said .\n`` While we often think of the decline of the American dream as a national problem \u2014 a challenge we \u2019 d like to solve through federal policy solutions \u2014 I really think the roots of these issues are at the very local level . ''", "Across America , there are pockets of poverty , communities that have been left behind or deprived of the basics needed to develop , like Pembroke Township , a small community south of Chicago along the Indiana border . In this community , one-third of the families live below the poverty line . It is one of the poorest communities in the country , with a median income that is among the lowest .\nIn the 1860s , newly freed slaves \u2014 Freedmen \u2014 settled into the rich farmland of the region . It was a land of promise and opportunity . During the Great Migration and the Great Depression , waves of black farmers settled here . Land was still available for black farms in part because much of it was seen as marginal .\nColumnists In-depth political coverage , sports analysis , entertainment reviews and cultural commentary .\nThe land is so bad , the joke became , as Rev . Hezekiah Brady Jr. , reported , \u201c you can \u2019 t raise hell on it . \u201d\nToday , the residents of Pembroke Township are denied the hope that their ancestors once held . In Pembroke , residents lack heat and access to basic necessities . They are the victims of economic violence in many ways . They can \u2019 t develop basic infrastructure without capital investment . Investment won \u2019 t come without basic infrastructure . They face a Catch 22 all too familiar to poor communities in this country .\nIn recent months , this has begun to change for the 2,100 residents of Pembroke . Wi-Fi has come to the community . Now Nicor Gas is joining with local officials trying to work out a plan to bring natural gas to Pembroke . A secure source of energy would help kickstart other development \u2014 and in turn create jobs and generate hope .\nTo bring energy to Pembroke will require regulatory changes , millions in investment and support from the business community , the residents of Pembroke , the state of Illinois and the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Nicor has made a serious commitment . Now it is time to turn up the heat on the others to ensure that the residents of Pembroke have heat .\nDr. Martin Luther King always envisioned the civil rights struggle in three different movements or phases . First would come basic civil rights , the end of segregation . The Supreme Court and the Civil Rights Act of 1965 helped achieve that . Then came political rights : The Voting Rights Act helped move toward that . It wasn \u2019 t just African Americans who profited , but women , young people and other minorities all made great strides to equal justice .\nThe final movement , which Dr. King knew would be the most difficult , was the movement for economic justice . Sadly , the war on poverty that was making great strides was lost in the jungles of Vietnam , and then abandoned under Ronald Reagan in 1980 .\nNow , as America suffers extreme inequality , a declining life expectancy , rising deaths of despair \u2014 from alcohol , or drugs or suicide \u2014 we need a new push for economic justice . It should focus on the pockets of poverty like Pembroke . It must engage the efforts of private enterprise and public and private resources .\nKeystone legislation like that proposed by Rep. James Clyburn , D-S.C. , that would target federal spending to the communities that have been mired in poverty for decades , joining the urban and the rural poor , across regional and racial lines , as the focus for new energy and new hope .\nWhat \u2019 s clear is that our current course won \u2019 t do it . Unemployment is low , but poor urban and rural communities still have not recovered . Communities like Pembroke won \u2019 t recover without focused energy .\nAs Dr. King taught us , that will happen only if citizens organize and lead the way .", "Despite lingering gloom from the economic recession , life is getting much better for the most distressed people all over the world . Since the 1980s , the share of people living on less than $ 1.25 day has plummeted from 53 % to just 17 % in 2011 . Globally , those at the bottom of the economic ladder is \u201c falling faster than ever , \u201d according to Oxford economics Fellow , Max Roser .\nIndeed , the World Bank is so elated by the trend that it believes , for the first time in human history , poverty can be completely eliminated by 2030 .\nYet , at the same time , the global rich-poor class gap is skyrocketing ; as of 2014 , the richest 80 people in the world now control more wealth than the bottom 50 % combined [ PDF ] .\nLund University economist , Andreas Bergh , has a contentious , if fascinating , theory : greater inequality means a greater portion of the population exists at the lowest income , making it cheaper to provide goods to a larger share of lower-income consumers . The more people need cheap products , the more incentive companies have to streamline non-luxury versions of food , education , and other goods . In other words , lower-income people scale .\nIn this way , rather than having an even distribution of income over many economic classes ( e.g . low , low-middle , middle , upper-middle , and upper ) , an economy with only a few classes allows companies to focus on making products for greater portion of similar customers .\nIn his paper , \u201c When More Poor Means Less Poverty , \u201d Bergh finds that as inequality increases around the world , the cheaper rice and Big Macs become .\nOn average , a 10 point increase in the Gini coefficient ( corresponding to shifting from the level of inequality in Latvia to Kenya ) decreases the time required to buy a kilo of rice by 7 minutes ( compared to the 2007 global average of 22 minutes ) . Similarly a corresponding inequality increase would on average decrease the time required for a Big Mac by 16 minutes ( compared to the 2007 global average of 37 minutes ) .\nThink of the difference between the global poor and rich as the difference between the iOS and Android operating systems . Apple designed a phone that only a relatively small portion of the world can afford . But the iPhone opened up an entirely new mobile market , allowing Google to create its free mobile operating system for the rest of the non-iPhone-toting world . Android especially thrives in countries with a broad lower-income base .\nThe more people need a cheap operating system , the more demand Google and its hardware partners have in making smartphones accessible . In other words , the co-existence of an influential rich class and large lower-income class can have economic benefits .\nIndeed , this could be one reason why even in Sweden , the former poster-child for financial equality , poverty is decreasing while the rich are getting richer [ PDF ] .\nNow , careful readers will note that an inverse relationship between poverty and equality is not an iron law of economics . It \u2019 s often the opposite . In many nations and U.S. states , increasing inequality makes life worse for the poor . The rich get richer , and nothing trickles down . Moreover , in nations where poverty is decreasing , it is often because welfare services have expanded . The market itself is not eliminating poverty .\nBut inequality and a shrinking middle class is not inherently bad for the poor . This is not to say we should cheer inequality or that the middle class should donate their money to the rich in the interests of alleviating poverty .\nThere is a nuanced relationship between income distribution and extreme poverty . We must be careful how we model welfare systems and taxes so that we maintain the productive parts of inequality while reducing its ill effects .", "The notion that racism is solely about institutionalized white power simply doesn \u2019 t compute for most Americans .\nA couple of weeks ago , the New York Times editorial board hired a technology writer , Sarah Jeong . When it was revealed that she had tweeted barbs against white people , conservatives formed a Twitter mob to demand her dismissal . While a few on the right said \u2014 or claimed \u2014 that they were offended by the substance of her tweets , the overriding passion derived from an understandable outrage about liberal double standards .\nThe argument took a familiar form : \u201c If a white or conservative person said something like this about any other group , her career would be over ! \u201d\nMany liberals responded that conservatives just don \u2019 t get it . There is no such thing as anti-white racism because racism is all about power . Whites \u2014 or white men \u2014 have power and other groups don \u2019 t .\nPerhaps because this theory defies lived experience , progressives offered a new defense : \u201c We don \u2019 t really mean it when we attack the pale patriarchy . \u201d\nVox \u2019 s Ezra Klein recalled that he didn \u2019 t enjoy the Twitter hashtag # KillAllMen , which apparently became popular in his progressive circle a while back . \u201c I didn \u2019 t like it . It made me feel defensive . It still makes me feel defensive . \u201d\n\u201c But , \u201d Klein added , \u201c I also knew that wasn \u2019 t what they were saying . They didn \u2019 t want me put to death . They didn \u2019 t want any men put to death. \u201d They just wanted things to be better for women .\nKlein has a point , but he also misses one . I have no doubt that many of his female \u2014 or male ! \u2014 compatriots aren \u2019 t much interested in wholesale androcide . Nor do I think Jeong is interested in \u201c canceling \u201d white people . These are shibboleths of the Woke Establishment .\nBut what Klein and others miss is that they can \u2019 t play Humpty Dumpty when it comes to the language they use . \u201c When I use a word , \u201d Humpty Dumpty famously said , \u201c it means just what I choose it to mean \u2014 neither more nor less . \u201d\nThe notion that racism is solely about institutionalized white power simply doesn \u2019 t compute for most Americans . In common parlance , racism means prejudice or bigotry on account of race or skin color . Period . The pathetic racists who marched on Washington this weekend don \u2019 t have much cultural power . Surely that explains their racism more than it mitigates or absolves it .\nIf a neo-Nazi paints a swastika on a Jew \u2019 s front door , no decent person withholds judgment pending an audit of the victim \u2019 s social or institutional power . We just call it anti-Semitism . Would you wait for a clever explanation if someone launched the hashtag # KillAllJews or # CancelBlackPeople ? It makes no sense to claim that Louis Farrakhan is not a racist when he says \u201c White people are potential humans \u2014 they haven \u2019 t evolved yet \u201d but that David Duke is a racist when he says something similar about blacks .\nEven if we were to collectively accept that \u201c racism \u201d means structural oppression by whites , we \u2019 d still need a word for hating or degrading people solely on account of their race . Why reinvent the wheel ? And why muddle the principle that this is bad ?\nThink of it this way : Would you want your kids to go to a school where the white kids were taught that the slightest racial insensitivity was a profound sin but all the non-white kids were free to say whatever they wanted about the white kids ?\nIt is right and proper to teach kids that bigotry against blacks or other particular groups is especially evil for historical reasons . But it is morally daft to celebrate or condescendingly explain away bigotry against whites as some sort of historical comeuppance for the sins \u2014 real or alleged \u2014 of their ancestors . ( It \u2019 s also counterproductive : There \u2019 s ample evidence that calling non-racist people racist actually makes them more racist . )\nDouble standards breed resentment and rage , regardless of ideological orientation . There \u2019 s a reason white supremacists co-opt the language of the Left , demanding identity politics for white people . \u201c I consider myself a civil- and human-rights advocate focusing on the underrepresented Caucasian demographic , \u201d Jordan Kessler , the racist \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally organizer , told NPR .\nThe double standard that says the Left can say whatever it damn well pleases , but the Right must constantly check its privilege , fuels hateful buffoons like Kessler .", "Feeling maligned by the media , Donald Trump is threatening to weaken First Amendment protections for reporters if he were president and make it easier for him to sue them .\n`` I love free press . I think it 's great , '' he said Saturday on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel , before quickly adding , `` We ought to open up the libel laws , and I 'm going to do that . ''\nThe changes envisioned by the celebrity businessman turned Republican front-runner would mean that `` when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles , we can sue them and win lots of money , '' he said at a rally Friday in Fort Worth , Texas .\nTrump added that , should he win the election , news organizations that have criticized him will `` have problems . '' He specifically cited The New York Times and The Washington Post .\nTrump last month threatened to sue the Post after the newspaper wrote an article about the bankruptcy of his Atlantic City casino . On Twitter , Trump has routinely criticized reporters who cover him and their news organizations , including The Associated Press .\n`` The press has to be fair , '' he said in the broadcast interview .\n`` His statement shows why we need libel protections , '' said Gregg Leslie , legal defense director for the Washington-based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press . `` Trump gets offended , he gets upset and he wants to sue to retaliate . That 's not a good reason to sue someone . ''\nLibel law in the United States generally makes it difficult for public figures to sue reporters or other people who criticize them . To win such a case , the plaintiff must demonstrate that factually incorrect statements were made with actual malice or a reckless disregard for the truth .\nTrump said he would like to lower that standard . `` We 're going to have people sue you like you never got sued before , '' he said .\nBecause the Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed the existing legal standard , Trump could not change libel laws as they affect public figures by executive order or even with an act of Congress , Leslie said .\n`` I 've never heard of politicians say they would repeal case law established under the First Amendment , '' he said . `` You 'd really need a constitutional amendment to do that . ''\nTrump 's comments on libel law are not the first time he has disagreed with widely held conceptions of constitutional law . Last year , he said he saw no obstacle to deporting children born to undocumented immigrants in the United States .\nCourts have regularly found that such children are natural born citizens entitled to the same rights as any other American . Trump has said he does not believe a constitutional amendment would be necessary to get his way .\n`` You do n't have to do a constitutional amendment . You need an act of Congress . I 'm telling you -- you need an act of Congress , '' he said in an interview with Bill O'Reilly of \u2588\u2588\u2588 last year .", "A major insight into human behavior from pre-internet era studies of communication is the tendency of people not to speak up about policy issues in public\u2014or among their family , friends , and work colleagues\u2014when they believe their own point of view is not widely shared . This tendency is called the \u201c spiral of silence . \u201d\nSome social media creators and supporters have hoped that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter might produce different enough discussion venues that those with minority views might feel freer to express their opinions , thus broadening public discourse and adding new perspectives to everyday discussion of political issues .\nWe set out to study this by conducting a survey of 1,801 adults . It focused on one important public issue : Edward Snowden \u2019 s 2013 revelations of widespread government surveillance of Americans \u2019 phone and email records . We selected this issue because other surveys by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 at the time we were fielding this poll showed that Americans were divided over whether the NSA contractor \u2019 s leaks about surveillance were justified and whether the surveillance policy itself was a good or bad idea . For instance , Pew Research found in one survey that 44 % say the release of classified information harms the public interest while 49 % said it serves the public interest .\nThe survey reported in this report sought people \u2019 s opinions about the Snowden leaks , their willingness to talk about the revelations in various in-person and online settings , and their perceptions of the views of those around them in a variety of online and off-line contexts .\nOverall , the findings indicate that in the Snowden case , social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues . Further , if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them , they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts , such as gatherings of friends , neighbors , or co-workers . This suggests a spiral of silence might spill over from online contexts to in-person contexts , though our data can not definitively demonstrate this causation . It also might mean that the broad awareness social media users have of their networks might make them more hesitant to speak up because they are especially tuned into the opinions of those around them .\nPeople reported being less willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA story in social media than they were in person\u2014and social media did not provide an alternative outlet for those reluctant to discuss the issues in person .\nFully 86 % of Americans reported in the Pew Research survey they were \u201c very \u201d or \u201c somewhat \u201d willing to have a conversation about the government \u2019 s surveillance program in at least one of the physical settings we queried \u2014at a public meeting , at a family dinner , at a restaurant with friends , or at work . Yet , only 42 % of those who use Facebook or Twitter were willing to discuss these same issues through social media .\nOf the 14 % of Americans who were not willing to discuss this issue in person , almost none ( 0.3 % ) said they were willing to have a conversation about this issue through social media . This challenges the notion that social media spaces might be considered useful venues for people sharing views they would not otherwise express when they are in the physical presence of others .\nNot only were social media sites not an alternative forum for discussion , social media users were less willing to share their opinions in face-to-face settings .\nWe also did statistical modeling allowing us to more fully understand the findings by controlling for such things as gender , age , education levels , race , and marital status\u2014all of which are related to whether people use social media and how they use it . That modeling allowed us to calculate how likely people were to be willing to express their views in these differing settings holding other things constant .\nThe results of our analyses show that , even holding other factors such as age constant , social media users are less likely than others to say they would join a discussion about the Snowden-NSA revelations .\nIn both offline and online settings , people said they were more willing to share their views on the Snowden-NSA revelations if they thought their audience agreed with them .\nPrevious research has shown that when people decide whether to speak out about an issue , they rely on reference groups\u2014friendships and community ties\u2014to weigh their opinion relative to their peers . In the survey , we asked respondents about their sense of whether different groups of people in their lives agreed or disagreed with their positions on the Snowden leaks . There was some notable variance between those who feel they know the views of their peers and those who do not know what others think . Generally , the more socially close people were\u2014e.g . spouses or family members\u2014the more likely it was that the respondents felt their views matched .\nWe again calculated how likely it was that someone would be willing to share their views in different settings , depending on their sense of whether their audience agreed with them . We found that , in the case of Snowden \u2019 s revelations about the NSA , it was clear that if people felt their audience supported them , they were more likely to say they would join a conversation :\nAt work , those who felt their coworkers agreed with their opinion on the government \u2019 s surveillance program were 2.92 times more likely to say they would join a conversation on the topic of Snowden-NSA .\nAt a family dinner , those who felt that family members agreed with their opinion were 1.90 times more likely to be willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA issue .\nAt a restaurant with friends , if their close friends agreed with their opinion people were 1.42 times more likely to be willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA matter .\nOn Facebook , if a person felt that people in their Facebook network agreed with their position on that issue , they were 1.91 times more likely to be willing to join a conversation on the topic of Snowden-NSA .\nThose who do not feel that their Facebook friends or Twitter followers agree with their opinion are more likely to self-censor their views on the Snowden-NSA story in many circumstances\u2014in social media and in face-to-face encounters .\nIn this survey on the Snowden-NSA matter , we found that when social media users felt their opinions were not supported online , they were less likely to say they would speak their minds . This was true not only in social media spaces , but also in the physical presence of others .\nThe average Facebook user ( someone who uses the site a few times per day ) was half as likely as other people to say they would be willing to voice their opinion with friends at a restaurant . If they felt that their online Facebook network agreed with their views on this issue , their willingness to speak out in a face-to-face discussion with friends was higher , although they were still only 0.74 times as likely to voice their opinion .\nThe typical Twitter user ( who uses the site a few times per day ) is 0.24 times as likely to share their opinions with colleagues at work as an internet user who does not use Twitter . However , Twitter users who felt that their online Twitter followers shared their opinion were less reserved : They were only 0.66 times less likely to speak up than other internet users .\nThe survey did not directly explore why people might remain silent if they felt that their opinions were in the minority . The traditional view of the spiral of silence is that people choose not to speak out for fear of isolation . Other Pew Research studies have found that it is common for social media users to be mistaken about their friends \u2019 beliefs and to be surprised once they discover their friends \u2019 actual views via social media . Thus , it might be the case that people do not want to disclose their minority views for fear of disappointing their friends , getting into fruitless arguments , or losing them entirely . Some people may prefer not to share their views on social media because their posts persist and can be found later\u2014perhaps by prospective employers or others with high status . As to why the absence of agreement on social media platforms spills over into a spiral of silence in physical settings , we speculate that social media users may have witnessed those with minority opinions experiencing ostracism , ridicule or bullying online , and that this might increase the perceived risk of opinion sharing in other settings .\nPeople also say they would speak up , or stay silent , under specific conditions .\nIn addition to exploring the impact of agreement/disagreement on whether people were willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA revelations , we asked about other factors that might shape whether people would speak out , even if they suspected they held minority views . This survey shows how the social and political climate in which people share opinions depends on several other things :\nTheir confidence in how much they know . Those who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations .\nThose who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations . The intensity of their opinions . Those who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject .\nThose who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject . Their level of interest . Those who said they were very interested in the Snowden-NSA story were more likely than those who were not as interested to express their opinions .\nPeople \u2019 s use of social media did little to increase their access to information about the Snowden-NSA revelations .\nWe asked respondents where they were getting information about the debates swirling around the Snowden revelations , and found that social media was not a common source of news for most Americans . Traditional broadcast news sources were by far the most common sources . In contrast , social media sources like Facebook and Twitter were the least commonly identified sources for news on this issue .\nThere are limits to what this snapshot can tell us about how social media use is related to the ways Americans discuss important political issues . This study focuses on one specific public affairs issue that was of interest to most Americans : the Snowden-NSA revelations . It is not an exhaustive review of all public policy issues and the way they are discussed in social media .\nThe context of the Snowden-NSA story may also have made it somewhat different from other kinds of public debates . At the time of this study , the material leaked by Edward Snowden related to NSA monitoring of communications dealt specifically with \u201c meta-data \u201d collected on people \u2019 s phone and internet communications . For a phone call , the meta-data collected by the NSA was described as including the duration of the call , when it happened , the numbers the call was between , but not a recording of the call . For email , meta-data would have included the sender and recipient \u2019 s email addresses and when it was sent , but not the subject or text of the email .\nAdditional information leaked by Snowden after our study was completed suggests that Western intelligence agencies monitored and manipulated the content of online discussions and the NSA recorded the content of foreign phone calls . In reaction to these additional revelations , people may have adjusted their use of social media and their willingness to discuss a range of topics , including public issues such as government surveillance . However , given the limited extent of the information leaked by Snowden at the time the survey was fielded , it seems unlikely that the average American had extensively altered their willingness to discuss political issues . Future research may provide insight into whether Americans have become more or less willing to discuss specific issues on-and offline as a result of government surveillance programs . While this study focused on the Snowden-NSA revelations , we suspect that Americans use social media in similar ways to discuss and get news about other political issues .\nAn informed citizenry depends on people \u2019 s exposure to information on important political issues and on their willingness to discuss these issues with those around them . The rise of social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has introduced new spaces where political discussion and debate can take place . This report explores the degree to which social media affects a long-established human attribute\u2014that those who think they hold minority opinions often self-censor , failing to speak out for fear of ostracism or ridicule . It is called the \u201c spiral of silence . \u201d\nThis report is a collaborative effort based on the input and analysis of the following individuals :\nOther major reports from the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Internet Project on the social and political impact of social networking sites on social and political activity can be found at :\nThis report contains findings from a nationally representative survey of 1,801 American adults ( ages 18+ ) conducted by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 and fielded August 7-September 16 , 2013 by Princeton Research Associates International . It was conducted in English and Spanish on landline ( N=901 ) and cell phones ( N=900 ) . The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points . Some 1,076 respondents are users of social networking sites and the margin of error for that subgroup is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points .", "Gloria Alvarez , the young woman from Guatemala I wrote about last week , just got blocked by Facebook . Why ? Because she criticizes socialism .\nAfter Alvarez joined me in my American studio to make a video we titled `` Socialism Fails Every Time , '' she flew to Mexico City to make a speech .\nA few days later she wrote me that `` some leftist 'students ' posted on a fanpage called 'Marxist and Leninist Memes ' : 'BOYCOTT Gloria Alvarez in our University ! We wo n't let her in ! ' ''\nSo Alvarez posted ( in Spanish ) on her own Facebook page : `` My dear Mexican socialists intolerants : Thank you ! for trying to boycott my event\u2026 showing that panic that you have for the debate of ideas . Given yours are so bad , that only with bullets they can be obeyed just like in Venezuela and Nicaragua . You demonstrate once again that you are the intolerant ones against freedom . ''\nShe ended her riff with a wise defense of free speech : `` Where words are exchanged , bullets are no longer exchanged . ''\n`` You recently posted something that violates Facebook policies , '' wrote Facebook .\nWhat violated Facebook policies ? Was it calling the people who demanded that she not be allowed to speak `` socialists intolerants '' whose ideas `` are so bad that only with bullets they can be obeyed '' ?\nWhen social media companies block you , the \u2588\u2588\u2588 is often mysterious .\nFacebook did say , `` For more information , visit the Help Center\u2026 ( U ) nderstand Facebook 's Community Standards . '' Good luck getting an explanation that way .\nAlvarez suspects she was blocked because her opponents , boycott advocates , complained about her . Leftists are good at launching campaigns to shut people up .\nFortunately , Alvarez has connections . A few days later she wrote , `` a friend of mine that has a cousin working on Facebook Latin America ( helped ) me to unblock my page this morning . ''\nExcept , most of us do n't have a friend whose cousin works for Facebook .\nFacebook , YouTube , Twitter , and other social media platforms promote themselves as sites that enhance communication , not censor it .\nI should n't use the word `` censor . '' When a private company blocks someone , it 's called editing . Companies edit to increase civil communication , improve the quality of discussion , delete threats and lies , etc . Editing helps make their sites more pleasant places to visit .\nCensorship and the First Amendment apply to governments . America 's Founders feared government censorship because government can use force , and we have just one government .\nBut if Facebook blocks me , I still can communicate via Twitter , my YouTube videos , or Instagram .\nBut wait . Facebook bought Instagram . And Google bought YouTube . If these big companies edit me out , it will be hard to reach people .\nConservatives claim social media companies are quicker to censor conservative speech . That 's probably true . The people who work for social media companies lean left . Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that , telling CNN , `` We need to constantly show that we are not adding our own bias , which I fully admit is more left-leaning . ''\nThat 's why conservative sites like PragerU have been limited by YouTube . Restricting Prager University 's videos is absurd . The site has millions of followers . It offers dignified lectures on conservative philosophy . They explain things my Princeton professors never taught me .\nThe lectures violate neither YouTube 's standards nor Facebook 's standards . But recently , PragerU discovered that some of its Facebook videos were watched by no one . Zero people .\nFacebook later apologized , saying someone flagged PragerU 's videos as `` hate speech , '' and at least one Facebook human `` content monitor '' agreed . He was being `` retrained , '' said Facebook .\nRight-winger Alex Jones was banned by all major social media platforms . Milo Yiannopoulos was banned by Twitter .\nBut I have n't seen enough data to convince me that the sites actively limit conservative speech alone . Facebook just deleted 800 political pages , including some that criticize police brutality .\nLeftist Glenn Greenwald tweeted after that purge , `` those who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content \u2026 are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed . That 's what has happened to every censorship advocate in history . ''\nThe best answer to speech we do n't like is : more speech .\nI like being able to hear numerous opinions\u2014even if I disagree with them .", "If CNN reporter Jim Acosta is such a troublous force inside the White House Briefing Room\u2014a \u201c rude , terrible person \u201d as President Donald Trump recently put it\u2014deserving of being banned from White House grounds , then why did Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders routinely call on him during the televised question and answer periods at the White House over the past 22 months ?\nHad Acosta \u2019 s behavior truly offended them , Sanders and Trump could have permanently stifled the pesky reporter by treating him like a ghost , averting their gazes and picking other reporters during question time . Acosta couldn \u2019 t have done anything about it . Instead , Sanders and Trump regularly called on Acosta , counting on the likelihood that he would do that Acosta thing of speechifying and playing microphone hog as he attempts to turn a question into an extended back-and-forth . Sanders and Trump have pretended exasperation at Acosta \u2019 s posturing\u2014posturing that hasn \u2019 t broken much news , by the way\u2014but not so secretly they happily wallow in his pomposity . By getting Acosta to play the preening , self-aggrandizing , sanctimonious reporter and using him as the punching bag for the White House \u2019 s anti-press strategy , Sanders and Trump have created a unique public venue to exhibit their hatred for the \u201c fake news \u201d of CNN .\nThe TV moments created by Acosta 's clashes\u2014see the Guardian 's reel of their best sparring matches\u2014have served him , too . If you \u2019 re a fan of reporters who are better at lecturing than asking a question and think White House briefings and presidential press conferences should resemble the bloodsport of duels , then you probably find the Acosta clashes sufficiently enriching to make CNN your cable news destination .\nAcosta \u2019 s forced exile and the lawsuit filed by CNN today demanding that Sanders and Trump return the \u201c hard pass \u201d that will allow him to roam the White House grounds have turned him into a free speech martyr , which I suppose he is . Like all First Amendment radicals , I deplore the Acosta ban and look forward to the day that he \u2019 s back in the White House making a pest of himself again . The case law cited in the suit by lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous , a top cock in the First Amendment bar \u2019 s pecking order , appears to prevent the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities \u201c for less than compelling reasons. \u201d Even Fox News Channel \u2019 s legal analyst Andrew Napolitano predicts that the matter will be resolved \u201c quickly \u201c in CNN \u2019 s favor .\nThe original charge Sanders made when barring Acosta\u2014that he had placed \u201c his hands \u201d on the White House intern trying to retrieve his microphone during the presser\u2014has been disproved . Today , attempting to argue against the CNN suit , Sanders shifted her rationale for the de-Acostafication of the White House , accusing him additionally and accurately for not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern .\nBut as Sanders herself acknowledges , this was not the first time Acosta had resisted yielding the floor . So where is the common justice in ejecting him from White House grounds without so much as a warning ? Sanders and Trump have thrilled in Acosta \u2019 s bad manners not only because his acting out helped personify their critique of CNN but also because it has made great TV drama for the president . Anything that \u2019 s good for ratings is good with Trump . It \u2019 s obvious from viewing the Acosta-Trump faceoff that Trump was spoiling for a fight\u2014 \u201c Here we go , \u201d Trump interrupted as Acosta began the wind-up on his first question\u2014and started swinging back from the get-go . He wanted what Acosta was bringing so he could re-assume his old reality-TV role as the heavy who banishes the pretentious upstart . When the CNN lawsuit rolled in today , Trump must have clicked his heels in joy at the prospect of kicking Acosta and CNN around some more .\nTelevised White House briefings have always been political theater but under Trump \u2019 s management they \u2019 ve generated as much genuine news as a low-wattage kitchen microwave . The endless bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have become the story , much to the detriment of journalism . I wouldn \u2019 t go so far to call the briefings useless\u2014they can connect reporters to otherwise hard-to-find facts and get the administration on the record\u2014but for real news you have to rely on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings waiting for news to arrive .\nLike so many episodes of The Trump Show , the martyrdom of Jim Acosta provides an entertaining sideshow . While it \u2019 s true that he \u2019 s more of a pain in the neck than a true newshawk , we can still call for his return to the White House briefing room in good conscience because being a pain in the neck is often a necessary part of the job . Besides , Sanders and Trump already miss him .", "President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon signed his much-hyped executive order on campus free speech \u2014 which he deemed a `` historic action to defend American students and American values '' that have `` been under siege '' on campuses .\n`` Under the guise of speech codes and safe spaces and trigger warnings , these universities have tried to restrict free thought , impose total conformity and shutdown the voices of great young Americans , '' Trump said Thursday before signing the order .\nThe order , however , essentially reinforces what schools are already supposed to be doing by formally requiring colleges to agree to promote free inquiry in order to get billions of dollars in federal research funding .\n`` While many schools \u2014 or all schools \u2014 are frankly supposed to follow this currently , it will ensure that grant dollars are associated through the grant-making process , and schools will have to certify that they \u2019 re following this condition , '' a senior administration official said earlier Thursday .\nStill the move , and the president 's rhetoric surrounding it , raised alarms for some civil liberties groups and conservatives \u2014 including at least one Republican lawmaker \u2014 who expressed concerns about federal overreach .\n`` I don \u2019 t want to see Congress or the president or the department of anything creating speech codes to define what you can say on campus , '' Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , who chairs the Senate HELP Committee , said in a statement . `` The U.S. Constitution guarantees free speech . Federal courts define and enforce it . The Department of Justice can weigh in . Conservatives don \u2019 t like it when judges try to write laws , and conservatives should not like it when legislators and agencies try to rewrite the Constitution . \u201d\nThe order directs 12 federal agencies that fund university research to add language to existing agreements that colleges have to sign to get the money . Public universities will have to vow to uphold the First Amendment \u2014 something they already must do \u2014 and private universities will have to promise to uphold their own `` stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech , '' essentially setting their own rules .\nIt will be up to the agencies to enforce the agreements , as they already do .\n`` Today we \u2019 re delivering a clear message to the professors and power structures trying to suppress dissent and keep young Americans \u2014 and all Americans , not just young Americans \u2026 from challenging rigid , far-left ideology , '' Trump said . `` If the university does n't allow you to speak , we will not give them money \u2014 it 's very simple . ''\nThe president vowed it was `` the first in a series of steps we will take to defend students ' rights . ''\nThe executive order is `` plainly unnecessary , '' the president of a group of public universities said .\n`` Public universities are already bound by the First Amendment and work each day to defend and honor it , '' Peter McPherson , president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities , said . \u201c As institutions of higher learning , public universities are constantly working to identify new ways to educate students on the importance of free expression , provide venues for free speech , and advance our world through free academic inquiry .\n\u201c This executive order doesn \u2019 t do much with regard to free speech , '' ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane said in a statement . `` Instead , it tells public universities to abide by the First Amendment , as they are already required to do , and private universities to abide by their existing policies . ''\nSome conservatives , however , believe colleges have n't done that , and are regularly stifling speech \u2014 especially conservative speech \u2014 by banning speakers , creating speech zones and pushing trigger warnings .\n`` College campuses are ground zero in the campaign by the liberal left to shut down conservative dissent , '' said Chandler Thornton , chairman of the College Republican National Committee . `` President Trump 's executive order is critically needed because college and university bureaucrats have absolutely failed to protect free speech on campus . ''\nTrump previously threatened to withdraw federal funding to the University of California , Berkeley , after riots on campus led it to cancel an event at which far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak . At Trump 's CPAC speech where he first mentioned the executive order , the president brought to the stage Hayden Williams , a conservative activist who was punched in the face while recruiting on the Berkeley campus for the conservative youth group Turning Point USA .\nThe Justice Department under the Trump administration , meanwhile , has backed lawsuits against colleges it believes are suppressing speech , including Berkeley .\nDonald Trump , Jr. , touted the move on Twitter Thursday morning as `` A big momentous day ! ''\n`` Super excited today that @ realDonaldTrump is signing an executive order today to protect free speech rights for ALL students ! '' he wrote . `` Great work by @ TPUSA and @ charliekirk11 who have been pushing this since the first time I met him years ago . ''\nSome , however , remained skeptical of federal intrusions into campus speech , especially given the president \u2019 s framing of the issue . The conservative Charles Koch Institute pointed to a statement the White House issued in which Trump slammed \u201c oppressive speech codes , censorship , political correctness , and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas . ''\n\u201c We are concerned that wrongly framing censorship as an ideological issue works against efforts to foster open intellectual environments on campus , '' Sarah Ruger , director of Free Speech Initiatives at the Koch Institute , said in a statement . \u201c The best policies are those that empower the academy to uphold its core ideals of academic independence and free inquiry . ''\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , which has sued colleges it believes are stifling speech , said in a statement that the order could result in `` unintended consequences that threaten free expression and academic freedom . ''\n`` To the extent that today \u2019 s executive order asks colleges and universities to meet their existing legal obligations , it should be uncontroversial , '' the group said . `` We note that the order does not specify how or by what standard federal agencies will ensure compliance , the order \u2019 s most consequential component . FIRE has long opposed federal agency requirements that conflict with well-settled First Amendment jurisprudence . We will continue to do so . ''\nThe American Council on Education , the leading higher education lobbying group , meanwhile , said the order is `` unnecessary and unwelcome , a solution in search of a problem . ''\n`` What remains to be seen is the process the administration develops to flesh out these requirements and the extent to which it is willing to consult with the communities most affected \u2014 especially research universities , '' said Ted Mitchell , the group 's president , in a statement . `` No matter how this order is implemented , it is neither needed nor desirable , and could lead to unwanted federal micromanagement of the cutting-edge research that is critical to our nation \u2019 s continued vitality and global leadership . \u201d\nThe order makes some moves beyond free speech , as well .\nIt directs the Education Department to add program-level data , including information on debt , earnings , repayment and default rates , to the existing College Scorecard . In addition , the order directs the department to publish the performance , by college , of PLUS loans for parents and graduate students . It also orders up a report from the department with recommendations on how the administration can put colleges on the hook for how well their students do after graduation .\n`` We \u2019 re going to make them have an incentive to keep their costs down , '' Trump said . `` I \u2019 ve watched this over a period of time . I figured it out very , very quickly . I just see their numbers go up very rapidly , because they do n't have the burden on them . ''", "Twitter 's verification program put the company at the center of another political headache this week , with the social media giant stuck between liberals who demand stricter rules about hate speech and misinformation and conservatives who fear the site will target them for their political views .\nTwitter 's `` blue checkmark '' verification program is meant to authenticate the identities of high-profile users . But it 's also come to be seen as an endorsement or mark of approval from Twitter , sparking outrage when the checkmarks were bestowed on white nationalists like Richard Spencer or Charlottesville , Va. , `` Unite the Right '' rally organizer Jason Kessler .\nThe social media site responded to the criticism Wednesday by taking checkmarks away from several users affiliated with the far right or white nationalism , as well as kicking one prominent Charlottesville marcher off the platform permanently .\nFurther changes are expected next week , when Twitter says it will implement more rules . Twitter declined to comment on the changes .\nWhile liberals cheered the crackdown , conservatives worried that they 'll be punished next . Describing the crackdown , a Breitbart headline declared that \u201c conservative figures \u201d had been \u201c purged . \u201d\nOne user who lost her verification , Laura Loomer , charged that Twitter was trying to \u201c annihilate conservatives from the internet . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re absolutely targeting people on the right , \u201d said Tim Gionet , an internet troll better known as Baked Alaska who attended the Charlottesville march with white supremacists and has made anti-Semitic statements on Twitter . \u201c Can you name one liberal that was deverified ? \u201d\nWhile several far-right and white nationalist figures affected by Twitter \u2019 s policy change on Wednesday lost their verified checkmarks , Gionet appears to be the only one who was outright banned from the platform .\nWhile the punishments focused on Twitter \u2019 s fringe right , some more mainstream conservatives raised concerns about taking away verifications .\n`` If they want to ban people , ban them . But verification is to prevent fraud , not to endorse viewpoints , '' tweeted conservative pundit Ben Shapiro in response to the changes .\nOthers took issue with a specific provision in the company \u2019 s new rules , which states that Twitter can deverify users based on behavior that occurs off Twitter .\n\u201c It 's worth noting that Twitter can remove your verified badge for behaviors made /off/ the platform , \u201d tweeted Ian Miles Cheong , a contributor to Tucker Carlson \u2019 s The Daily Caller . \u201c Just as well , the company can take action against your account for supporting any group or individual that it claims promote certain behaviors . \u201d\n\u201c You know what this means for # MAGA , \u201d he warned , referring to President Trump \u2019 s campaign promise to \u201c make America great again . \u201d\nCheong told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he doesn \u2019 t support the views of white nationalists like Spencer and Kessler , but argues that it \u2019 s damaging for Twitter to censor speech .\n\u201c The reason why is : if you drive them underground ... they \u2019 re going to radicalize further , \u201d Cheong argued . \u201c The best way to counter arguments is to provide good arguments . \u201d\nThe Twitter crackdown comes amid concerns that other Silicon Valley firms are discriminating against the right .\nInternet conservatives similarly fumed after YouTube began to strip their videos of ads , cutting into the revenue right-wing internet pundits receive from them . Some of the community \u2019 s most extreme members were also incensed when Reddit moved to purge Nazi subreddits from its site .\nNew decisions from tech companies are frustrating members of the fringe-right , whose communities had blossomed on sites like Reddit , Twitter and YouTube in recent years .\nTwitter once declared itself \u201c the free speech wing of the free speech party. \u201d While the company still prides itself on being a forum for open discussions , it \u2019 s now less comfortable with that characterization .\n\u201c I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas , the world is automatically going to be a better place , \u201d Twitter co-founder Evan Williams told The New York Times in May . \u201c I was wrong about that . \u201d\nGab \u2014 a Twitter rival with laxer content rules that British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and other fringe right figures have taken to after being banned from Twitter \u2014 agreed with calls from some right-wing figures for Twitter to be regulated as a utility .\n\u201c Twitter essentially is like a telephone , \u201d Gab \u2019 s Chief Operating Officer Utsav Sanduja told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It is a public utility and it needs to be regulated one . \u201d\nSpencer made a similar argument , calling on \u201c Washington to regulate Silicon Valley \u201d on Twitter .\nTheir sentiments echo former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon \u2019 s push to regulate massive Silicon Valley tech firms like Google , Facebook and Amazon .\nSuch arguments have been made more typically by Democrats like Sen. Al Franken Alan ( Al ) Stuart FrankenAl Franken to host SiriusXM radio show \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Morning Report - Presented by National Association of Manufacturers - The impeachment of President Trump has begun GOP Senate candidate said Republicans have 'dual loyalties ' to Israel MORE ( D-Minn. ) , who has advocated for net neutrality-styled regulations of major internet firms .\nDespite increasing calls for tighter oversight of internet firms , such policies are still unlikely in the short term . In the meantime , some high-profile members of the online right see Gab as their next best bet \u2014 albeit one with far less reach than Twitter .\nGab says that Twitter \u2019 s stricter verification rules have benefited it . Sanduja said over email on Wednesday night that the platform saw a spike of 2,000 new user sign ups on Thursday , the day the new Twitter rules went into effect .\nGab platform has 310,000 users in total , according to Sanduja .\n\u201c These unforced errors from Twitter have been fantastic for Gab , \u201d the company said in a statement .", "Earlier this month , I wrote a column asking what Democrats should do about sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden , the party 's presumptive nominee for president . My answer ? Not much . The accusation made by Tara Reade , a former Biden staffer from his days in the Senate during the early 1990s , did n't strike me as especially convincing , so Democrats , I suggested , could move forward without much concern . Though toward the end of the column I included two caveats : If Reade offered further corroboration of her claims or if evidence emerged of a larger pattern of abusive actions toward women on Biden 's part , that could well change my views of the matter .\nJust two weeks later , both of my conditions have been met .\nLast week we learned that Reade 's mother called into the Larry King Show in 1993 to talk about how her daughter had quit working for a `` prominent senator '' after unspecified `` problems '' as a staffer . Then earlier this week Business Insider reported that a former neighbor of Reade 's ( a self-described `` strong Democrat '' ) recalls a conversation with her in 1995 or 1996 in which Reade tearfully described being sexually assaulted by Biden . Together , those two stories help to corroborate Reade 's specific claim about herself .\nFinally , on Tuesday , a 2008 essay by the late Alexander Cockburn surfaced in which the journalist reported that Biden had made `` unwelcome and unwanted '' sexual advances against a woman in 1972 or 1973 . That establishes a possible longstanding pattern of Biden 's behavior that further validates Reade 's accusation ( and potentially opens the door to others ) .\nIn light of these revelations , the time has come for a two new questions : Can Biden survive the gathering storm around Tara Reade 's allegations ? And if so , will that fact be good or bad for the Democratic Party in November ?\nThe first question is the easier one to answer : Biden 's presumptive nomination is quite likely to survive the corroboration of Reade 's claims . That 's because members of Biden 's electoral base in the Democratic Party \u2014 older , culturally moderate white working-class voters in the Midwest and older , culturally moderate African Americans \u2014 are unlikely to be turned against him by one corroborated allegation of sexual assault from nearly three decades in the past . If anything , rank-and-file Democrats have expressed regret that some # MeToo allegations have taken down popular members of the party ( former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken is the example cited most frequently ) \u2014 and they 're also irritated that Democrats are expected to adhere to standards their opponents openly flout .\nThe factions of the party most likely to turn on Biden because of a sexual-assault scandal are those who 've been least wedded to his candidacy from the start \u2014 those firmly on the left , who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders ; and white urban progressives , who tended to favor Sen. Elizabeth Warren 's candidacy . Neither group possesses the numbers or influence in the party to get it to overrule the preferences of the other two electorally crucial factions \u2014 and obviously their opinions will also carry little weight with the candidate himself . This means that , so long as no additional corroborated accusations materialize , Biden will most likely get to hold onto the nomination if he wants to .\nThat might turn out to be a very bad thing for the party come November .\nBut how could this be ? How could a sexual assault allegation place Biden at a disadvantage in the general election against President Trump , a man who has openly bragged on tape of sexual assault and has himself been accused of rape on multiple occasions ?\nOn substance , Trump will have zero moral ground to stand on . But he wo n't be taking a stand in the name of treating women with respect . Neither will he be accusing Biden of being a sexual predator . Instead , he and the entire Republican noise machine will constantly , relentlessly hammer Biden , leading Democrats , and the media for flagrant hypocrisy and double standards . The moral content of the issue wo n't matter one bit . What will matter is that Biden has set himself up as a moral arbiter on issues of sexual harassment and violence , insisting we must `` believe all women , '' and that in the fall of 2018 he and many other members of his party sought to destroy the reputation of Trump 's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for allegations of sexual assault that were less convincingly corroborated than those Reade has lodged against Biden .\nThe Democratic nominee for president and his party are ruthless political operators who seek above all else to destroy their enemies and help themselves , all the while setting themselves up as impartial moral authorities . This will be the message , driven home over and over again : that claims of purity and impartiality are pretense , transparent fakes . Democrats might posture like they 're better than Republicans , including the president , but they are n't . They 're every bit as bad . They 're just more dishonest about it .\nThe Biden campaign 's effort to portray itself as a moral reset from the debasement of the Trump years will run into this counter-message like a power sander . The Trump campaign will strip it away with a barrage of paid ads , prime-time cable news diatribes , and a hailstorm of tweets \u2014 all of it repeating the message ( illustrated with clips from and about the Kavanaugh hearings ) that Biden and his fellow Democrats are every bit the BS artists that Trump is , only they wo n't admit it . They 'll lie about it , right to your face .\nTo Democrats this prediction may sound implausible . There 's no way that Trump , a man whose mendaciousness is well established and total , can possibly succeed in portraying Biden as more dishonest than he is . But he wo n't have to show that Biden is worse , just that he 's no better .\nThat 's Trump 's ( perhaps only ) winning move \u2014 to bring the playing field down to his level , to lower Biden 's favorability rating , to make him seem less admirable , less likable , less morally upstanding , less \u2026 superior than Trump . He did the same thing against Hillary Clinton in 2016 , using the FBI investigation of her email practices while secretary of state as a cudgel . Last summer , the strategy was to impugn Biden 's son , making them both look like corrupt wheeler dealers in Ukraine . That did n't work out , but now Reade 's allegations have made it possible for Trump and his party to do what they love most of all , which is to accuse Democrats and the media of smarmy double standards instead .\nOf course this wo n't work with most Democratic voters , but that wo n't be its aim . The aim will be to ensure maximal turnout and Trump loyalty among Republicans \u2014 and the destruction of Biden 's reputation among independents in crucial swing states .\nWill it succeed ? Trump will be facing re-election while presiding over a deadly pandemic and the early stages of an economic depression , so who knows . What I do know is that the behavior Tara Reade has plausibly alleged about the presumptive Democratic nominee is going to be a major liability for him as we head toward Election Day .\nWant more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox ?

For its part , National Amusements said it would not seek a merger between the two companies for the next two years .\nIn a statement it announced that Mr Moonves would step down as chairman , president and CEO with immediate effect .\nThe Financial Times said Mr Moonves was resigning because this would entitle him to a hefty severance package , including stock options .\nUS media said the resignation package for Mr Moonves could amount to $ 100m .\nHowever , CBS said he would not receive any severance benefits until the result of an independent investigation into him .\nIn a separate move , six directors have stepped down and six new ones have been elected .\nMr Moonves issued a statement on Sunday saying : `` Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am . ''\nThe New Yorker quoted a statement in which he says : `` The appalling accusations in this article are untrue . What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS .\n`` And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women . In my 40 years of work , I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations . ''\nA further six women also accused Mr Moonves earlier this year . All of them said they believed their careers had suffered because they rejected his advances .\nAt the time Mr Moonves said he `` may have made some women uncomfortable '' in the past , adding : `` Those were mistakes , and I regret them immensely . But I always understood and respected ... that 'no ' means 'no ' .\nOn Monday , CBS This Morning presenter Norah O'Donnell told viewers that `` he 's my boss - or he was my boss - and that makes it hard to comment on it '' .\nShe discussed her conversation over the weekend with co-host Gayle King about how it had been less than a year since their fellow CBS presenter , Charlie Rose , resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations against him .\nShe then turned to the camera and said : `` There is no excuse for this alleged behavior . It is systemic and it is pervasive in our culture . ''\n`` And this I know this is true to the core of my being : Women can not achieve equality in the workplace or society until there is a reckoning and a taking of responsibility . ''", "Speaker Ryan On Sexual Harassment : 'We Are Having A Watershed Moment In This Country '\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , says the rash of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations coming to light could end up being a `` watershed moment '' in changing the culture \u2014 including on Capitol Hill \u2014 that has covered them up far too long .\n`` We are having a watershed moment in this country . I think this is a defining moment in this country . And I think it needs to be a defining moment in this country , '' Ryan told Morning Edition 's Steve Inskeep in an interview on Capitol Hill on Thursday .\nPolitics Listen : House Speaker Paul Ryan Defends GOP Tax Plans In 'Morning Edition ' Interview Paul Ryan Defends GOP Tax Plans Listen \u00b7 7:02 7:02\n`` I think we 're all horrified at these stories we 've been seeing unfold in the last few weeks . I think we 're all realizing that sexual harassment in America is absolutely pervasive and it 's got to go and we need to end it , '' Ryan continued . `` And nowhere more is this important to set a standard and an example than elected officials . We should be held to a high standard . ''\nPoliticians in both parties have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks . On Thursday , Ryan called for Rep. John Conyers , D-Mich. , to resign after a former aide made public her allegations of sexual harassment against the veteran lawmaker . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , also called on Conyers to step down . The Michigan Democrat has been hospitalized for stress .\nAnother accuser also came forward on Thursday against Sen. Al Franken , D-Minn. , alleging that he groped her during a 2003 photo opportunity , bringing his total accusers to five women who say the senator groped or forcibly kissed them in recent weeks . The Senate Ethics Committee confirms it has launched an initial inquiry into the allegations against Franken .\nMeanwhile , Republicans are continuing to grapple with Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore , who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault when they were teens and he was in his 30s . Several women say he pursued them romantically , and one woman said he had sexually assaulted her when she was 14 .\nPresident Trump himself was accused of sexual assault by several women during the 2016 campaign , allegations he continues to deny . And in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape that surfaced just ahead of the election Trump bragged about groping and forcibly kissing women . According to reports , Trump has now begun to privately assert that tape was a fake , despite acknowledging its veracity last year .\nInskeep asked Ryan about the differences between the allegations against Moore \u2014 which the House speaker reiterated he believed were `` very , very credible '' \u2014 and the accusations against Trump .\nThe speaker said he was `` focused on Congress '' because that 's where Moore wants to go . `` My job here as speaker of the House is to help make sure that Congress is an institution that we 're proud of and that 's what I 'm focused on , '' he said .\nAsked again about the differences , Ryan said , `` I have n't spent my time reviewing the difference in these two cases . ''\nRyan admitted , `` It 's no secret that [ Trump ] and I have had our differences of opinions , '' but he underscored they still align on policy issues and goals .\n`` What I see is a president who is fighting for the things that I 'm fighting for . I see a president who 's fighting for an agenda that will make a positive difference in people 's lives , '' Ryan said . `` Is this president unconventional ? No two ways about it . He 's very unconventional . But if we make good by the American people by actually improving their lives and fixing problems and finding solutions that are bothering them ? That 's a good thing . ''\nAll these recent political allegations are in addition to women coming forward with stories of sexual assault against high-profile Hollywood moguls such as Harvey Weinstein and journalists like NBC 's Matt Lauer , CBS ' Charlie Rose and top NPR executives as well .\nRyan told NPR that , as a father , the issue is a personal one for him as he has watched the swirl of scandal over the past few weeks .\n`` I want my daughter to grow up in a country \u2014 she 's 15 years old \u2014 where she is empowered and respected . Wherever she goes , wherever she works , and whatever she does . And I think nowhere should that be more obvious and apparent than working here on Capitol Hill , '' Ryan said .\n`` So I think here in Congress we should set ourselves to standards that we expect of other people , '' the House speaker added . `` We should set high standards for ourselves , so that we can be role models and set examples , and clearly people have been falling short of that , and I think we always have to endeavor to do a better job on that . ''\nCongress has recently passed legislation to adopt mandatory training on harassment and discrimination for lawmakers and Capitol Hill employees . In a news conference on Thursday , Ryan applauded the legislation but also said , `` This is an important step , but it 's one step . ''", "A new piece of evidence has emerged buttressing the credibility of Tara Reade \u2019 s claim that she told her mother about allegations of sexual harassment and assault related to her former boss , then-Sen. Joe Biden . Biden , through a spokesperson , has denied the allegations . Reade has claimed to various media outlets , including \u2588\u2588\u2588 , that she told her mother , a close friend , and her brother about both the harassment and , to varying degrees of detail , the assault at the time . Her brother , Collin Moulton , and her friend , who has asked to remain anonymous , both confirmed that they heard about the allegations from Reade at the time . Reade \u2019 s mother died in 2016 , but both her brother and friend also confirmed Reade had told her mother , and that her mother , a longtime feminist and activist , urged her to go to the police . In interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Reade also mentioned that her mother had made a phone call to \u201c Larry King Live \u201d on CNN , during which she made reference to her daughter \u2019 s experience on Capitol Hill . Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that her mother called in asking for advice after Reade , then in her 20s , left Biden \u2019 s office . \u201c I remember it being an anonymous call and her saying my daughter was sexually harassed and retaliated against and fired , where can she go for help ? I was mortified , \u201d Reade told me . Reade couldn \u2019 t remember the date or the year of the phone call , and King didn \u2019 t include the names of callers on his show . I was unable to find the call , but mentioned it in an interview with Katie Halper , the podcast host who first aired Reade \u2019 s allegation . After the podcast aired , a listener managed to find the call and sent it to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOn August 11 , 1993 , King aired a program titled , \u201c Washington : The Cruelest City on Earth ? \u201d Toward the end of the program , he introduces a caller dialing in from San Luis Obispo , California . Congressional records list August 1993 as Reade \u2019 s last month of employment with Biden \u2019 s Senate office , and , according to property records , Reade \u2019 s mother , Jeanette Altimus , was living in San Luis Obispo County . Here is the transcript of the beginning of the call : KING : San Luis Obispo , California , hello . CALLER : Yes , hello . I \u2019 m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington ? My daughter has just left there , after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . KING : In other words , she had a story to tell but , out of respect for the person she worked for , she didn \u2019 t tell it ? CALLER : That \u2019 s true . King \u2019 s panel of guests offered no suggestions , and instead the conversation veered into a discussion of whether any of the men on set would leak damaging personal information about a rival to the press .\nReade , after being read the transcript of the call , said that it gelled with her memory of it , and , after the video was surfaced , confirmed it is her mother \u2019 s voice on the call . \u201c Aww , I have not heard my mom \u2019 s voice in awhile , \u201d she said . There are several notable things about the emergence of the call . On the one hand , the caller does not specifically mention \u201c sexual harassment \u201d or retaliation , as Reade had recalled . On the other hand , the reference to being unable to \u201c get through with her problems \u201d aligns with Reade \u2019 s claim that she complained to superiors in Biden \u2019 s office and got nowhere , and the reference to going to the press makes clear that the caller is talking about more than just generic problems at the office . The problems , she makes clear , would damage the senator if exposed . Reade \u2019 s inability to remember the exact date of the alleged assault , or its precise location , or the precise location of the office where she picked up the form needed to file a complaint , has been used by skeptics to suggest the allegation is fabricated . What the emergence of the call shows is that even if Reade \u2019 s memory is off on timing or details , the substance of her claims \u2014 in this case , that her mother called Larry King and discussed her situation \u2014 can still be true .\nThe call also calls into question the credibility of Biden \u2019 s denial . Reade said that she filed a complaint about Biden \u2019 s harassment with Marianne Baker , effectively the office manager in the Biden office . The Biden campaign released a statement from Baker , which said that neither Reade nor any other employee had ever complained about improper behavior . \u201c In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period \u2014 not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone , \u201d Baker said in the campaign \u2019 s statement . \u201c These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades. \u201d For Baker \u2019 s statement to be true , Reade would have had to have lied to her friend , brother , and mother about having complained to Biden \u2019 s office . There is no obvious reason Reade would make up a story to those closest to her about the Senate office not taking Biden \u2019 s harassment seriously , while at the same time resisting pressure to go to the press . Reade has said that the complaint she filed was related to the harassment she said she faced , and did not address the assault . The complaint was left with Biden \u2019 s office , and if it still exists , is with Biden \u2019 s papers at the University of Delaware . The school recently told reporter Rich McHugh that the papers are sealed until two years after Biden leaves public life .\nAnd @ UDelaware -- which houses the collection of Joe Biden 's senatorial papers -- just confirmed to me that the papers `` will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life . '' \u2014 Rich McHugh ( @ RichMcHugh ) April 21 , 2020", "Former Vice President Joe Biden addresses a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , April 30 , 2019 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nIt \u2019 s just basic American due process , so why is Betsy DeVos getting slammed ?\nWhy should Joe Biden get due process , but not others accused of sexual misconduct ?\nThat \u2019 s the question raised by the progressive reaction to Tara Reade \u2019 s accusation against Biden on the one hand , and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u2019 s new rules for handling sexual-harassment cases on college campuses on the other .\nThere have been voices on the left who believe Reade , but generally the note has been one of skepticism about her allegation , along with admonitions that the evidence must be considered carefully .\nMany of the popularizers of the phrase \u201c believe women \u201d have climbed down to simply saying that women \u2019 s accusations should be heard and then evaluated in light of the facts .\nIn other words , what any fair-minded person has maintained throughout the # MeToo era , including during the Brett Kavanaugh battle .\nAnd yet there is still progressive outrage over the new Title IX rules developed by DeVos that seek to bring balance and fairness to the consideration of accusations against people who aren \u2019 t the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States .\nThe actor/activist Alyssa Milano , an erstwhile vocal advocate of \u201c believe women , \u201d has now modulated her view to accommodate her continued support of Biden . She explains that we need to shift our mindset \u201c to believing women . But that does not mean at the expense of giving men their due process and investigating situations , and it \u2019 s got to be fair in both directions . \u201d\nThis is an unassailable position , and one that obviously has implications for the Title IX debate . Even if it doesn \u2019 t entail supporting every particular of DeVos \u2019 s reforms , it should mean an openness to them . Nonetheless , late last year Milano slammed DeVos over the proposed changes in highly personal terms .\nThe upshot of Milano \u2019 s inconsistency is that a famous and powerful man , whom she happens to know and support , should get more consideration than a young , politically powerless , unknown student somewhere .\nA piece from Vox on what \u201c believe women \u201d means in the context of Reade \u2019 s allegation quoted Sage Carson , manager of an advocacy organization called Know Your IX . According to Carson , the concept has been twisted \u201c into this idea that you never provide a fair process for folks to go through . \u201d\nAn article in Mother Jones reported that anti-sexual-assault activists still supporting Biden have a number of reasons . One of them is \u201c an eagerness to replace Trump \u2019 s cabinet , including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , whose overhaul of campus sexual assault policy has prompted outcry from survivors . \u201d\nIn other words , Biden gets the benefit of the doubt on Tara Reade explicitly as a means to continue to deny the accused on campus any such benefit of the doubt .\nThe DeVos changes are meant to inject elementary fairness into proceedings that went off the rails in response to Obama-administration guidance in 2011 . Students punished by these kangaroo courts have had considerable success appealing their cases in the courts .\nThe DeVos rules reverse the single-investigator model that empowered one person to investigate a case and recommend a decision .\nNow the investigator and adjudicator must be different . Students must have access to evidence , and the accused must know what is alleged and by whom and when .\nThere must be a live hearing and an opportunity for cross-examination by both sides .\nTitle IX coordinators and investigators can \u2019 t be biased one way or the other .\nThese measures are so in keeping with basic American traditions that it \u2019 s hard to believe that anyone could oppose them .\nThe ultimate irony is that Joe Biden was a prime mover behind the Obama-era Title IX rules . As Robby Soave of Reason magazine notes , \u201c If the allegation against Biden were being decided by the kind of adjudication system that he helped enshrine on college campuses , it \u2019 s quite likely that he would be found guilty . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a lesson there , although it \u2019 s doubtful anyone \u2014 emphatically including Biden himself \u2014 is willing to learn it .", "House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing a backlash for defending Rep. John Conyers and even questioning those accusing him of sexual harassment during a Sunday interview .\nPelosi , D-Calif. , touted Conyers , D-Mich. , on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d as an American icon .\n\u201c John Conyers is an icon in our country , \u201d she said . \u201c He has done a great deal to protect women . \u201d\nShe added : \u201c I believe he understands what \u2019 s at stake here . He will do the right thing . \u201d\nPelosi said Conyers , and the women accusing him , were entitled to \u201c due process , \u201d but also asked : \u201c I don \u2019 t know who they are\u2014do you ? \u201d\nHost Chuck Todd asked whether Pelosi believed the women alleging Conyers treated them inappropriately .\nPelosi \u2019 s interview drew harsh criticism on Twitter from those who accused her of playing party politics and focusing on \u201c power . \u201d\n\u201c Pelosi is a survivor and knows she can \u2019 t lose support in black caucus so she is gentle w Conyers . It \u2019 s always about power , \u201d Chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp tweeted Monday .\nPolitical editor for TownHall.com and Fox News contributor Guy Benson pointed to Pelosi \u2019 s interview as an example of a \u201c double standard \u201d used by Democrats in regard to sexual harassment allegations . Benson cited Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore , who has been accused of pursuing teenage girls when he was in his 30s , and even sexual assault -- claims he denies .\n\u201c I \u2019 m no Roy Moore defender , to put it mildly . But for those unable to comprehend why many conservative voters are willing to stand by him , look no further than Pelosi \u2019 s MTP performance today . Many GOP voters see Dems as ruthless defenders of power & are sick of double standards , \u201d Benson tweeted Sunday .\nDespite Pelosi \u2019 s defense of Conyers ' record , she applauded the Democratic congressman 's decision later Sunday to step down from his leadership position on the House Judiciary Committee while the Ethics Committee reviews the harassment allegations against him .\n\u201c Zero tolerance means consequences , \u201d Pelosi said in a statement Sunday , noting that she asked for an ethics investigation into Conyers and that he \u201c agreed to step aside \u201d as ranking member on the committee .\n\u201c We are at a watershed moment on this issue , and no matter how great an individual \u2019 s legacy , it is not a license for harassment , \u201d Pelosi said . \u201c I commend the brave women coming forward . \u201d\nPelosi \u2019 s statement seemed to add more fuel to the Twitter fire , as pundits and journalists pointed out the difference in tone from her comments earlier that day .\nThe ethics committee announced last Tuesday that it began an investigation into Conyers , after receiving allegations of sexual harassment and age discrimination involving staff members and about the congressman using \u201c official resources for impermissible personal purposes . \u201d\nThe announcement followed a BuzzFeed News report last Monday that Conyers \u2019 office paid a woman more than $ 27,000 under a confidentiality agreement to settle a 2015 complaint that she was fired from Conyers \u2019 staff for rejecting his sexual advances .\nAlso last week , Melanie Sloan , a lawyer who worked with Conyers on the House Judiciary Committee , alleged that she was called into Conyers \u2019 office to discuss an issue and found him \u201c walking around in his underwear. \u201d It is unclear when the alleged incident occurred . She also claimed Conyers screamed at her , fired and re-hired her , and criticized her for not wearing stockings .\nConyers has continued to deny the allegations , but said he would fully cooperate in the probe .", "Yesterday the New York Post reported that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is having an affair with Democratic strategist Tim Mynett . The allegation was made in divorce papers filed by his wife . In July , Omar filed for divorce from her current husband . A refresher :\nDr. Beth Jordan Mynett says her cheating spouse , Tim Mynett , told her in April that he was having an affair with the Somali-born US representative and that he even made a \u201c shocking declaration of love \u201d for the Minnesota congresswoman before he ditched his wife , alleges the filing , submitted in DC Superior Court on Tuesday .\nIt turns out Mynett 's firm was funneled a boat load of Omar 's campaign cash . He was paid more than $ 200,000 for consulting and the campaign reimbursed at least $ 21,000 for his personal travel . That travel was n't properly reported or itemized .\nAn official complaint regarding the large payments to Mynett 's firm has already been filed , alleging she broke the law .\n`` Today , NLPC filed a Complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) against Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) alleging that she and her campaign violated the prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by reimbursing political consultant Tim Mynett for his travel in 2019 . The Complaint also alleges that Omar and her campaign failed to itemize the travel reimbursements , as required , '' the National Legal and Policy Center released in a statement Wednesday .\n`` Although Mynett 's formal relationship with Rep. Omar 's campaign began in July 2018 , with the payment of $ 7000 directly to Mynett , the reimbursements for Mynett 's travel did not commence until April 2019 , the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her filing that her husband told her of the affair , and made a 'shocking declaration of love ' for Rep. Omar , '' the complaint states .\nAccording to the divorce filing , Mynett 's `` more recent travel and long work hours now appear to be more related to his affair with Rep. Omar than his actual work commitments . ''\nAnd then there are these timing details from the Washington Examiner :\nHere 's the odd thing : The overwhelming majority of Omar 's funds spent on the E Street Group were paid after she won the contested primary and during the totally noncompetitive general election race in her D+26 district . Contrary to FEC rules , Omar 's filings did not designate whether her E Street Group disbursements ( or any of her disbursements ) were for the primary election or the general election .\nOmar is refusing to discuss her `` personal life '' and has not commented on the issue of campaign funds being improperly used .\n`` I have no interest in allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it , '' Omar told CBS Minnesota today .\nIn June , Omar was ordered to payback thousands of dollars to her campaign after breaking campaign finance laws .", "Judge Rules Fewer Political Groups Can Keep Their Donors Secret\nA U.S. district court judge awarded a victory to campaign finance reform advocates on Tuesday when she ruled the Federal Election Commission was too loosely enforcing a campaign finance regulation passed in 2007 , allowing some big-money donors to remain anonymous .\nThe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act required the identification of contributors giving $ 1,000 or more to fund `` issue ads '' near Election Day . But since it was enacted , only a few of those contributors have been revealed , because the FEC ruled those disclosures were n't required for ads supporting specific candidates . The Los Angeles Times reported the details of the ruling :\n`` The decision concerns a type of issue ads that became ubiquitous in recent elections . Typically , the ads suggest that voters call a senator or congressman and give an opinion about something . When those ads mention a candidate and are run close to elections , they 're known as 'electioneering ' communications , and the amount of spending has to be reported . ''\nRep. Chris Van Hollen ( D-Md . ) , along with reform advocacy groups Campaign Legal Center , Public Citizen and Democracy 21 , sued the FEC in 2011 to overturn the 2007 regulation . The Associated Press reported that Democracy 21 's president , Fred Werthiemer claimed the FEC allowed loopholes in the regulation to fund federal elections with `` dark money . ''\nVan Hollen called Judge Amy Berman Jackson 's Tuesday decision `` a victory for democracy . '' His partners in the lawsuit also hailed the ruling .\n`` We are seeing a full-throated endorsement of disclosure by the lower courts , '' said Tara Malloy with the Campaign Legal Center . `` We are enjoying the victory , though I am sure the fight will continue . ''\nConservative groups that attempted to intervene in the case have voiced their disappointment . Thomas Kirby , an attorney who represents the Center for Individual Freedom , told The Washington Post that `` the ruling created an upside-down world in which greater burdens are imposed on those who merely refer to a candidate than on those who expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate . ''\nIn Tuesday 's decision , Jackson ruled that the FEC `` overstepped '' when it wrote the 2007 regulation into the campaign finance laws . That regulation , among other cases , led to the victory of the 2010 Citizens United case in the Supreme Court , which allowed nonprofits to hide their funding sources .\nThat decision essentially deleted the restrictions of the McCain-Feingold Act . The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that over $ 140 million of the so-called `` dark money '' was spent in the 2014 election . Bloomberg 's Businessweek reports that tens of thousands of TV ads run this year by GOP fundraising operation Crossroad GPS , founded by former Bush administration adviser Karl Rove , `` helped Republicans win control of the Senate . ''\nJackson 's decision that the regulation was `` arbitrary , capricious and contrary to law '' recalled an original report by the Sunlight Foundation in January . The report stated that Crossroads GPS violated election laws by failing to register itself as a political group instead of a nonprofit , social-welfare operation \u2014 a distinction that came with a huge impact .\n`` In recent years , the group Crossroads GPS has spent tens of millions on political ads fueled by anonymous donors . Registering as a political group would have forced the nonprofit to begin naming its big-time benefactors . Crossroads has also become a model for hundreds of other committees that during the last election cycle pumped more than $ 300 million into the campaign \u2014 an estimate that is undoubtedly low because of the lack of disclosure required of these organizations . ''\nIt was also noted in the judge 's ruling that the FEC reported their findings in 2007 at 5:05 p.m. before a weekend \u2014 what 's known in the news industry as a `` Friday night news dump '' because people are believed to be paying the least attention to the news during that portion of the week .\nThe FEC now has the option of either appealing Jackson 's decision or change its regulations . The six members are evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats and likely will have a difficult time agreeing on a course of action .\nFEC Chairman Lee Goodman told The Washington Post , `` I 've always said that I 'm open to judicial guidance on this issue , and now we 'll have to study the court 's opinion to determine exactly what obligation the FEC has in response . ''", "More trouble is looming for Sen. Robert Menendez ( D ) of New Jersey : According to an Associated Press investigation , the embattled New Jersey Democrat sponsored legislation that , if passed , would have aided one of his biggest donor 's investment in a natural gas vehicle conversion company .\nThe report , published Monday , stated that Senator Menendez sponsored a bill to give tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to natural gas . The bill could have benefited Salomon Melgen , the Florida eye doctor whose close relationship with Menendez has spurred a Senate ethics investigation . Dr. Melgen is an investor and member of the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. , which designs , manufactures , and sells products to convert diesel- and gas-fuel vehicles to natural gas .\nMenendez \u2019 s backing of the natural-gas bill marks another convergence of interest between the politician and a major donor and is a thorn for the senator . But political watchers in New Jersey say the bill sponsorship is one part of a larger clean-energy agenda from the senator , who has a history of supporting environmental causes . As such , it is unlikely this latest allegation represents a conflict of interest , says Brigid Harrison , a political scientist at Montclair State University , who predicts that Menendez will survive the latest storm .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still not convinced ... that this kind of behavior reaches to the status where it becomes enormously problematic in voters \u2019 minds , \u201d says Professor Harrison . \u201c I \u2019 m not seeing any illegality or conflict of interest here . \u201d\nThe bill-sponsorship revelation revives the larger issue of the senator \u2019 s relationship with Melgen , with recent reports suggesting that Menendez was providing political favors for Melgen in exchange for campaign support .\nMenendez used Melgen \u2019 s private jet for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic in 2010 , flights that were not reimbursed until three years later , when news reports called the senator \u2019 s conduct into question .\nMenendez also intervened in a Medicare billing dispute between Melgen and federal authorities , as well as a port security contract , allegedly in order to protect the interests of his friend and donor , according to news reports . The allegations are compounded by a $ 700,000 donation Melgen made to Majority PAC , a `` super political-action committee '' created to elect Senate Democrats that ultimately made a $ 582,500 contribution to Menendez \u2019 s 2012 reelection campaign , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .\nMenendez has vehemently denied all allegations of impropriety , including any allegations of conflict-of-interest stemming from this latest report . His office did not respond to calls regarding his sponsorship of the natural gas bill .\nAccording to the AP report , Menendez joined Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R ) as a key backer of the natural gas bill . Soon after , Melgen joined the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. , which makes technology to perform such conversions . Though his investment in the company is confidential under US Securities and Exchange Commission rules , the company required a minimum investment of $ 51,500 , according to the AP .\nUltimately , the bill didn \u2019 t get enough votes to make it out of the Senate . However , while it was under consideration , a consultant for Gaseous Fuel Systems spent $ 220,000 lobbying Menendez and other congressional officials , according to interviews and Senate records as reported by the AP .\n\u201c There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen , \u201d the AP said in its report . \u201c Instead , the connection between the two men \u2019 s interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator \u2026 and his millionaire backer . \u201d\nEvidence of \u201c close symmetry \u201d in this latest development , say analysts , is not enough to topple Menendez .\n\u201c Menendez has been involved in clean-energy technology for a long time , \u201d says Ross Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J. \u201c In light of Melgen 's apparently limited and distant role in GFS , I think it is more of a coincidence than anything more sinister . I think it is as likely that Menendez got Melgen interested in converting truck fleets to natural gas as it was the other way around . \u201d\nOther clean-energy initiatives the senator has supported include co-sponsoring legislation aimed at jump-starting offshore wind energy , extending solar energy tax credits , and creating block grants to spur green-energy projects .\nMenendez recently reintroduced the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act and Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act , legislation he originally introduced in the 112th Congress to end tax subsidies for the \u201c Big 5 \u201d oil companies .\n\u201c It isn \u2019 t that this came out of the blue , it \u2019 s part of a larger cohesive agenda ... to deal with energy issues the country is facing , \u201d says Harrison of Montclair State University . \u201c His record is an accurate reflection of his policy concerns , and this is one part of that . \u201d\nAnd though the AP report singled out Menendez , the senator isn \u2019 t alone in supporting the natural gas bill \u2013 or in sharing a passion with supporters for similar causes . In fact , the House version of the natural gas legislation had 181 co-sponsors .\nThe natural gas industry spends hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying members of Congress , including Menendez and his staff . \u201c They are not alone in being lobbied , \u201d says Harrison .\nMenendez \u2019 s ethics controversy has had an impact on his poll numbers , and this latest development may further damage the senator \u2019 s image .\nA Quinnipiac University poll found Menendez \u2019 s approval ratings plummeted 15 percentage points between January and February , as news reports emerged about his relationship with Melgen . His approval rating dropped form 51 percent in mid-January to 36 percent in mid-February . The same poll found only 28 percent of New Jersey voters said the senator was \u201c honest and trustworthy . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

In one case , a retired member of Congress with money left in his account used the cash to pay his wife roughly $ 20,000 since Election Day .\nDisgraced former Rep. Aaron Schock ( R-Ill. ) resigned after a firestorm of criticism over his use of campaign dollars to underwrite a lavish lifestyle , among other alleged misdeeds . But the truth is , while Schock was by all accounts an extreme case , he is far from the exception . It fact , elected officials routinely tap their campaign accounts to pay for things that appear to have little to do with seeking another term in Congress , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of campaign documents .\nIndeed , donor dollars can , at times , resemble a slush fund . And experts say the reason is because lawmakers have almost complete latitude to decide what constitutes a campaign expense .\n\u201c The House Ethics Committee typically gives ( members of Congress ) a wide berth in defining what is considered campaign or officially connected activities , \u201d said Kenneth Gross , a veteran ethics and election lawyer at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . \u201c However , under House and [ Federal Election Commission ] rules , personal use of campaign funds is strictly prohibited . \u201d\nIn the wake of revelations that Schock allegedly misrepresented his congressional expenses by tens of thousands of dollars , Michigan Republican Rep. Candice Miller \u2019 s House Administration Committee is reviewing internal procedures and controls on the spending of taxpayer dollars . A grand jury is currently hearing testimony related to Schock \u2019 s alleged misspending of taxpayer dollars .\nBut unlike official expenditures , campaign expenditures are barely monitored . Case in point : Schock publicly admitted to several errors on FEC reports and promised to file amendments . More than a month after resigning , the Illinois Republican still has not filed any corrected records .\nCongress ' petty cash problem Members of Congress have almost total discretion to determine what is a legitimate campaign expense . Here are some of the more unusual ways they have used donor dollars : Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D-Ca . ) : Gifts for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi from swank stores such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman , more than $ 2,000 . Rep. Bob Brady ( D-Pa. ) : Christmas gifts from Capital Grille , upwards of $ 10,000 per year . Rep. Henry Cuellar ( D-Texas ) : Servicing his BMW in Alexandria , Virginia , nearly $ 3,400 . Sen.

Gene Green ( D-Texas ) : Gifts for his D.C. and district staff , roughly $ 3,000 . Retired Rep. Buck McKeon ( R-Ca . ) : Money left in campaign post-retirement in January , $ 250,000 .\nPaying for gifts is one of the unique ways that members of Congress use their campaign accounts . Most corporations wouldn \u2019 t allow the boss to withdraw thousands of dollars from business coffers without any oversight to hand out cash gifts to employees , yet that \u2019 s essentially what Rep. Gene Green does . At the end of each year , the Texas Democrat takes roughly $ 3,000 from his reelection fund and gives each staffer in his Washington and district offices $ 200 as a holiday present .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t buy gifts , \u201d Green said . \u201c I give , typically , [ it ] started out at $ 100 and now I give the staff whether D.C. staff or district staff $ 200 at Christmas . \u201d\nDozens of members of Congress reward people who work on their reelection campaigns .\nRep. Robert Brady , a powerful Democrat from Philadelphia , shells out more than $ 10,000 every year at Capital Grille , buying Christmas gifts for campaign aides . He hasn \u2019 t won with less than 74 percent of the vote since he was first elected in 1998 .\n\u201c Since members run for reelection every two years , it \u2019 s important to say \u2018 thank you \u2019 to the men and women who volunteer so much of their time and energy to his campaigns , \u201d said Stanley V.

Louie Gohmert represents a district on the eastern border of Texas , but one of his campaign line items last year was $ 272 for a meeting room at the Intercontinental Victoria Island in Lagos , Nigeria . In three expenditures in November and December , Gohmert paid more than $ 5,400 at the Andaz Hotel in London . He also spent time in Oxford at the Old Bank Hotel .\nGohmert \u2019 s spokesman , Kimberly Willingham , said Gohmert was giving political speeches in England , but did not respond to questions about whom Gohmert addressed .

Nor is it clear how much came from the small donors about whom Trump boasts .\nSome of those answers wo n't be revealed until the middle of October , when the campaign and its joint fundraising committees with the RNC will be required to file financial reports with the Federal Election Commission . But other details \u2014 including the amount raised from small donors in the 24 hours after the debate \u2014 may never be independently verifiable , thanks to the nuances of campaign finance reporting requirements .\nThose nuances were lost in Trump \u2019 s boasts about the fundraising haul during a Tuesday evening speech in Melbourne , Florida , nearly 24 hours after the debate .\n\u201c Today , we had something where I understand through largely small donors and some others , we had the biggest day we \u2019 ve ever had , \u201d Trump told the crowd in a humid airplane hangar . \u201c Because of the success last night of the debate , they raised almost $ 18 million today . Can you believe it ? $ 18 million . That \u2019 s a lot . $ 18 million in one day , think of that . And that was largely because of last night . \u201d\nTrump carried the theme through Wednesday night , boasting to a raucous crowd at the Waukesha County Expo Center about the $ 54 million he \u2019 d put into his campaign , and adding \u201c but we \u2019 re being helped by the small donors . And yesterday , because of the tremendous success of the debate , we raised almost $ 18 million in one day . \u201d\nIf Trump \u2019 s post-debate fundraising haul is anywhere near $ 18 million , it would be a major boost for a campaign that has lagged behind that of Hillary Clinton in fundraising and advertising . ( In fact , Trump 's campaign has said it plans to spend the cash infusion on a planned $ 140 million ad buy . ) And it would stand as the biggest single-day fundraising haul , by far , of Trump 's campaign , though it \u2019 s not possible to track such tallies precisely .\nBut it \u2019 s become an increasing political tactic to embellish selective details about fundraising \u2014 especially small-donor fundraising \u2014 to enhance the appearance of grass-roots momentum at critical moments of a campaign . Clinton used the tactic during her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign and again after her party \u2019 s nominating convention in July . Her campaign boasted that in the 24 hours after she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination , it raised $ 8.7 million \u2014 which at the time stood among the biggest single-day fundraising tallies .\nA Trump campaign source said that only $ 5 million of the $ 18 million haul came in online donations made directly to the campaign , which tend to be the types of donations most driven by organic grass-roots energy . Online donations also usually are smaller and can be more useful in the long term since the donors who give them can continue to contribute without hitting the cap on donations of $ 2,700 for the primary election and $ 2,700 for the general election .\nThe remaining $ 13 million came through phone call solicitations made as part of a campaign \u201c call day \u201d in which about 100 major donors and campaign insiders \u2014 including Trump \u2019 s children and his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence \u2014 made telephone solicitations from the campaign \u2019 s headquarters in Manhattan \u2019 s Trump Tower .\nThose donations would most likely be larger , since they would come from donors who either had a track record of writing big checks or who knew the person making the call .\nThe campaign source said that the call day donations were about equally split between the campaign and a joint fundraising committee called Trump Victory that includes the Trump campaign , the RNC , and about a dozen state party committees .\nTrump Victory can accept checks as large as $ 449,500 , making it easier to bring in huge sums of cash quickly . But , no matter how large the check to Trump Victory , only $ 2,700 can go to the Trump campaign , with the rest going to the RNC and the state parties .\nSteve Mnuchin , the Trump campaign \u2019 s finance chairman , would not say how much of Tuesday \u2019 s haul would end up in the campaign \u2019 s coffers , but he pointed out that having a well-funded RNC also helps the campaign .\n\u201c From our standpoint , we were raising money for the joint fundraising committee and the campaign , it \u2019 s all very important because it \u2019 s all going to support either the ground campaign or more media , \u201d said Mnuchin .\nHe participated in the call day and issued a statement afterward declaring that \u201c with this kind of energy and generous support behind us , we are going to have President Donald J. Trump in the White House . \u201d\nMnuchin would not comment , however , on how much of the money raised during the call day was in the form of pledges versus actual cash donations .\n\u201c We have a very high collectability rate on any pledges we get , \u201d he said . \u201c We are at close to 100 percent . \u201d\nBut a leading Republican fundraiser said that , with call days , there \u2019 s often a \u201c difference between pledged and collected \u201d contributions , so finance professionals are \u201c always skeptical when a call day is included in any explanation . \u201d\nAdditionally , GOP finance professionals have raised concerns about the return on investment from Trump \u2019 s small-dollar fundraising operation , which is run largely through a San Antonio-based Web design firm with no previous political experience that has been paid $ 12.5 million by the Trump campaign .\nThe online fundraising effort has relied on heavy spending to rent email lists and place digital ads soliciting small donations , sometimes producing duplicative or poorly targeted results .\nAnd on Wednesday , Trump \u2019 s campaign sent three very similar emails from his son Eric Trump boasting that the campaign was \u201c on path now to shatter a 48-hour fundraising record , and you could help us do it , Friend . \u201d", "A protestor outside the location for the 2017 \u201c Congress of Tomorrow \u201d Joint Republican Issues Conference in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , January 25 , 2017 . REUTERS/Mark Makela\nConservatives who enter progressive domains like the academy or elite media are quite familiar with the idea of tolerance . Such institutions place an enormous amount of emphasis on it , in fact , so much so that they reserve the right to be intolerant to preserve the tolerant ethos of the community , sometimes explicitly . In one of my favorite First Amendment cases , I sued a university that declared in no uncertain terms , \u201c Acts of intolerance will not be tolerated . \u201d\nYes , it used those exact words . Think for a moment \u2014 isn \u2019 t every act of enforcement a new violation that requires a new act of enforcement , triggering another violation ? Ah , never mind . We know what the university wanted , a catch-all provision it could use to expel , punish , and silence anyone who ran afoul of the prevailing campus orthodoxy .\nBut I don \u2019 t want to focus on intolerance . Let \u2019 s talk about tolerance , instead . Earlier this week I read an old post by \u201c Scott Alexander , \u201d a pseudonymous psychiatrist who writes at the blog Slate Star Codex . Called \u201c I can tolerate anything except the outgroup , \u201d it blows up the notion that the kind of inclusion the Left claims it values bears any relationship at all to true tolerance .\nAs Alexander notes , a person on the left will claim that they \u2019 re tolerant because of their regard for \u201c gays , lesbians , bisexuals , asexuals , blacks , Hispanics , Asians , transgender people , and Jews. \u201d But ask that same person a simple question , \u201c What \u2019 s wrong with gay people ? \u201d and the answer is immediate : \u201c What do you think I am , some kind of homophobic bigot ? Of course I have nothing against gay people . \u201d\nThen , guess what , you \u2019 re not tolerating anything . You \u2019 re mistaking tolerance for fellowship or tolerance for tribalism . The word \u201c tolerance \u201d of course implies that there is something to tolerate .\nTo the very marrow of their being , they believe that they \u2019 re something they \u2019 re not . They have taken the vice of their particular brand of tribalism and transformed it into the false virtue of fake tolerance .\nI like Alexander \u2019 s definition of true tolerance : \u201c Respect and kindness toward members of an outgroup \u201d \u2014 not respect and kindness toward members of what others would define as an outgroup , but rather respect and kindness toward people that are out of your group . His concept reflects Christian values like grace or charity , which imply that there is something to forgive or something to overlook in your relationships with others . When there is nothing to forgive or nothing to overlook and no patience required , there \u2019 s no tolerance . There \u2019 s no grace . There \u2019 s no charity .\nThe result of this flawed understanding is that millions of people misapprehend their own values . To the very marrow of their being , they believe that they \u2019 re something they \u2019 re not . They have taken the vice of their particular brand of tribalism and transformed it into the false virtue of fake tolerance .\nTo be clear , there are some progressives who are wise to this game . They \u2019 ve read their Herbert Marcuse , and they know quite well that the new tolerance \u2014 what Marcuse called \u201c liberating tolerance \u201d \u2014 means \u201c intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left. \u201d But most progressives haven \u2019 t read Marcuse . They \u2019 ve never heard of him , and they \u2019 d be shocked at the notion that one of the alleged defining characteristics of their lives is a fiction .\nI \u2019 m of course thinking of all this in connection with The Atlantic \u2019 s termination of my friend and former colleague Kevin Williamson yesterday . The justification for Kevin \u2019 s firing \u2014 as repeated endlessly on Twitter \u2014 is that women don \u2019 t want to \u201c share office space with a man who wants them dead. \u201d There are two easy responses to this assertion .\nFirst , it \u2019 s false . As Kevin has explained elsewhere , he \u2019 s generally against the death penalty , he \u2019 s against lynching , and he \u2019 s against ex post facto laws . So , no , women would not be sharing office space with someone who \u201c wants them dead . \u201d\nSecond , is there no appreciation for Kevin \u2019 s tolerance ? He \u2019 s the son of a teen mom , born shortly before Roe v. Wade , and narrowly escaped being aborted . He \u2019 d be sharing office space with people who believe it would have been totally fine , completely morally acceptable , and possibly virtuous if a doctor had ripped him to pieces in his mother \u2019 s womb .\nThe bottom line is that one party in this controversy \u2014 Kevin Williamson \u2014 was willing to be tolerant . As Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg related in his termination memo , Kevin had been \u201c nothing but professional \u201d in his interactions . In other words , Kevin had \u201c shown kindness and respect toward members of [ his ] outgroup . \u201d\nBut all too many progressives don \u2019 t see that . To them , there was nothing for Kevin to tolerate . Their views on abortion aren \u2019 t just tolerable , they \u2019 re glorious . They \u2019 re liberating .

What was intolerable was the notion that a man \u2014 no matter how courteous and professional in person \u2014 could sit next to them advocating ideas they hate .\nThere is a conversation to be had about whether a writer \u2019 s views should disqualify him from employment at any given magazine . Mission-driven journals , like Reason or The Nation or \u2588\u2588\u2588 , hire people who share and broadly advance the mission of the magazine ( while of course permitting and encouraging debate from within their respective ideological camps ) . Journals like The Atlantic at least seem to aspire to something different . They \u2019 re left-leaning , to be sure , but do not have an explicit ideological bent . In fact , the magazine explicitly claims to be \u201c of no party or clique \u201d and has certainly published works from left and right . It \u2019 s printed my work , for example . I doubt The Nation would be interested in doing the same .\nBut in polarized times , \u201c of no party or clique \u201d is a hard space to occupy . It requires moral courage . It requires the ability to withstand considerable internal and external pressure . It requires the ability to treat with respect and kindness even people you might otherwise despise . The Atlantic has the right to define its own mission and message . It has the right to hire and fire writers according to their viewpoints . It \u2019 s not the government . It \u2019 s a private actor with its own rights to free speech and freedom of association .\nExercise those rights , but progressives be honest about your purpose . You can call it tribalism . You can call it social justice . Just , please , do not lie and call it tolerance .", "A hair \u2588\u2588\u2588 owner in Dallas , Texas ; then , armed protestors in Michigan and other states ; recently , images of packed boardwalks and swimming pools ; and now the `` mass debate '' urging parishioners to attend regular religious services .\nAll of this in the face of dire consequences for public health amid an unrelenting global pandemic . These events are a mere smattering of a series of protests throughout the country that seek to resist the `` tyranny '' of state governors who have imposed lockdown restrictions in their states . These protests took what has now become a far too familiar form in American politics , connecting extremists waving Confederate `` battle flags '' and brandishing assault weapons to people demanding a right to shop without taking health precautions .\nAs Republican lawmakers assert that the `` cure ca n't be worse than the disease '' and the need to reopen the economy , they extol a neo\u2013Social Darwinist worldview that privileges a survival of the fittest \u2013 or , at least , those who are wealthy enough and have the health insurance to cloister themselves for the duration .\nTo some , this problem may seem to pose a genuine paradox : on the one hand , the rights of the individual and individual choice ( liberty ) and the restriction of that liberty in the face of government actions to protect public health . But this is no paradox at all \u2013 in fact , it reflects a deeper degeneracy of the concept of freedom in contemporary American politics and culture . The cracks and fissures in American society that we have seen opening during this pandemic are rooted in a broader change in Americans ' understanding of the concept of freedom and the ways that this has been exploited and manipulated by the powerful . Understanding this requires some sense of where the modern idea of freedom came from and how it was defended .\nThe birth of modern political philosophy had at its core a crucial idea about what political freedom actually meant . According to many early modern political theorists , the concept of liberty denoted the capacity to follow rules and norms that one was able to accept based on one 's conscience . Laws , norms and institutions were not to be arbitrarily enforced upon individuals \u2013 i.e. , according to the whim or interest of some powerful agent \u2013 but , rather , were to be ratified by one 's own reason and reflection . Liberty was a freedom from dependence and control as well as a freedom to create and follow laws that had the common interest as the foundation of their legitimacy .\nThis idea of liberty as freedom from the domination of others as well as a freedom to create laws and impose them upon one 's own actions in accordance with the common good and interest was worked out by thinkers such as Machiavelli and Spinoza no less than Locke and Jefferson , among others . It was weaponized during the age of democratic revolutions in Britain , the United States , France , and Haiti and formed the basis for a modern view of politics and human freedom .\nBut defenders of monarchy and feudal hierarchy , status and privilege demonized the concept of liberty , likening it to a devolution of order and the slide into chaos . Thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes , Robert Filmer and others saw any notion of liberty as essentially linked to a decay of social order . Hobbes saw liberty as a cause of chaos and a state of nature where each did as he pleased . And as Filmer famously put the matter in the opening chapter of his `` Patriarcha '' ( 1680 ) that it was a new and `` dangerous opinion '' where liberty was essentially the power of each to act without the guidance of a sovereign .\nLocke pointed out that these thinkers confused liberty with license , and later philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau would argue that our freedom as persons was dependent on our ability to think in terms of a `` general will , '' or in the common interest , even as Immanuel Kant would later make the concept of autonomy the cornerstone to any modern notion of freedom . All agreed , in the end , that liberty was the capacity for one to make laws of action for oneself according to reason , and this reason was one that was anchored in the common , universal parameters of our living in a social world with and among others . All agreed that freedom required responsibility : that to be free meant to take on the burden of self-legislation as a member of a free community . Only in this way could the principle of self-determination and self-rule be secured . Without the ethos of social responsibility , freedom would devolve back into tyranny and dominance : if you could not govern yourself as a member of the community , then others would step in to govern for you .\nMuch of American political history took a similar course with respect to the idea of liberty . Initially concerned with the conscience of the individual and the ability to protect property , the concept of liberty gradually matured into one where the freedom of each was interdependent on the freedom of others . After the Civil War and the emergence of the Gilded Age , the Progressive movement began to rework the concept of liberty more extensively . Thinkers such as George Herbert Mead , Charles Cooley and John Dewey reworked liberalism into a doctrine that held that the freedom of the individual was not a matter of removing their constraints to accumulate property or do as they pleased , but one that was a function of the extent to which each could partake in the highest caliber of public goods . The expansion of intelligence , the enrichment of one 's capacity to make choices , deliberate about the problems of their community , were all dependent upon this new concept of the individual . Castigating the persistence of the older , individualistic conception of liberty , Dewey argued in 1935 : `` It is absurd to conceive liberty as that of the business entrepreneur and ignore the immense regimentation to which workers are subjected . . . . [ F ] ull freedom of the human spirit and of individuality can be achieved only as there is effective opportunity to share in the cultural resources of civilization . ''\nThe cultivation of this kind of freedom required a rich nexus of public goods and regulation . Dewey and other progressives rightly saw that modern technological society needed this sense of responsibility even more to guarantee individual freedom . The New Deal and the social democratic welfare state of post-World War II America can be seen as an application of this reworked theory of liberty . But today this has degenerated as we see a reprise of the very narrow conception of liberty that Dewey and his contemporaries attacked as outmoded and out of step with the modern world . Neoliberalism has pushed this reductive , anti-social form of liberty against the social liberalism of the preceding decades . In many ways , the presence of a pathological understanding of freedom has its foundations in the very ways we conducted our pre-pandemic lives . Over the last four decades , neoliberal policies have chipped away at our public institutions , drained state budgets , marginalized public goods like education , and de-regulated our economy . Public life has shriveled as a consequence . Privatization has only reinforced our separateness from the public realm . Ideas about freedom have therefore been retuned to a condition not unlike a Hobbes ' state of nature where a war of all against all prevails .\nThe ideological project of neoliberalism has been to re-appropriate the concept of liberty and circumscribe it to the narrow realm of property , privacy and economic interest . What use are common goods when each lives according to one 's own efforts ? Liberty now is the absence of restraint , the elimination of any kind of direction over your life and your choices . The political right has made much of this simplistic philosophy : they convinced many citizens to sign on to a corporate agenda that has been able to undo the reforms made throughout much of the twentieth century in economic and social policy . The backlash against technical experts , unions , a robust social safety net , and other struts of an enlightened , socialized democracy is only gaining in momentum .\nBut there are other forces sustaining this culture of degenerate liberty . Alongside the undermining of the public institutions and spaces that interconnect us , neoliberalism has fostered a hyper consumerist culture . We are a nation of frantic consumers . Those individuals who , in highly publicized instances , stockpiled urgently needed medical supplies were trained by a culture that eagerly awaits Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales . Freedom is the freedom to violently consume . Deprived of the addiction to consumption or confronted by the idea that someone else might need something more urgently than you , it is easy to see why the closure of the economy might inspire rage . Entangled with the false conception of freedom is a false conception of human needs and human dignity .\nAnd so , when we consider again the protests against instructions to stay at home or consider the well-being of fellow citizens by social distancing or wearing masks , we should be aware that these behaviors are the product of the long cultivation of a particularly malign understanding of freedom \u2013 one forged to legitimate a public philosophy of anomic individualism that could justify neoliberalism and that is now quite literally making our republic sick . Freedom without responsibility no longer is freedom , it is a kind of licentiousness that is socially as well as personally damaging . Neoliberalism helped rot out the ethos of social responsibility that accompanied modern norms of freedom . The paranoia that accompanies relentless economic competitiveness and social inequality , extended working hours , a culture of senseless consumption and hedonism \u2013 all have contributed to the sense that one is in this alone for one 's own benefit . Indeed , it is no accident that the largest percentage of victims of this pandemic have been essential workers deprived of the right unionize , elderly residents of for-profit nursing homes with little regulation , and people of color whose communities have been marginalized by austerity budgets .\nIn many respects , what Bernie Sanders calls democratic socialism owes far more to the brand of liberalism advocated by Dewey and other philosophers of the Progressive and New Deal eras than to any socialist thinker . Indeed , Sanders has been right that this tradition of thought is more authentically American than the more recent short-sighted and acquisitively individualistic public philosophy nurtured by neoliberalism . In planning its strategy to combat the pandemic , the Biden campaign will also have to confront the pathological conception of freedom that has made the United States one of the worst victims of this pandemic . It will have to show that an orientation toward the common good is requisite for any vital sense of individual liberty . For now we are once again facing the prospect that an unmanaged form of license , masquerading as liberty , will force us to accept more coercive forms of political life .\nAnd as Americans reflect on what the COVID-19 crisis means for the future of American politics and culture , they may want to reflect anew on the ways our ideas about freedom have devolved and instead seek to retrieve once more a sense of social purpose to our degenerated culture of freedom . As Democrats suit up for their match with Donald Trump , this renewed sense of freedom should be the cornerstone for a new public philosophy : one that has democratic purpose , common interest and individual liberty together at its center . To lose this fight will give aid to the enemies of human progress and the culture of freedom that many fought and died for over the course of centuries .", "\u201c The 360 \u201d shows you diverse perspectives on the day \u2019 s top stories and debates .\nDebates over masks and other face coverings have been at the center of discussion since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. For much of that time , the conversation focused largely on practical matters , like how effective masks are at stemming the spread of the virus and questions about shortages for health care workers .\nThe debate has shifted in recent weeks . There are no longer questions about whether masks prevent infection . Experts agree that even homemade ones help . The current conversation is more contentious . Those who refuse to wear masks have been accused of ignorance or selfishness while the mandates that they be worn outside or in shops have been painted as violations of civil liberties .\nThe discontent over masks has been strong enough to force some politicians to change their policies . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine , who has been praised for his early and aggressive response to the virus , has lifted the state \u2019 s order requiring masks be worn inside stores , saying , \u201c People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do. \u201d The city of Stillwater , Okla. , rescinded its mask policy after employees at some stores faced threats of violence .\nThe disagreements over masks have even turned violent . In Michigan a security guard was killed after reportedly demanding a patron wear a mask .\nHow did the discussion of masks morph from a conversation about their medical merits to a clash over politics and liberty ?\nOne of the most obvious answers is the partisan divide over how best to respond to the pandemic . After facing criticism for his administration \u2019 s actions during the onset of the outbreak , President Trump has turned his focus to reopening the country and accused skeptics of his largely unpopular plan of playing politics . Declining to wear a mask could be , for many , a gesture of support for the president and his vision that it \u2019 s time to start returning to normal .\nTrump may have solidified this view by refusing to wear a mask at recent public appearances despite the administration \u2019 s recommendations for U.S. residents .\nWearing a mask can be a symbol of trust in leaders and scientists who set health policies . Refusing to wear one suggests a rejection of that authority . The mishmash of laws from state to state combined with confusing messaging from medical authorities like the World Health Organization may be contributing to doubts about the importance of face coverings .\nThe intensity of the disagreement may have more emotional roots , some psychiatrists say . In times of difficulty , humans are wired to look for someone to blame for the challenges they face . Mask wearers may see the bare-faced as responsible for exacerbating the health risks of the outbreak . Non-wearers might believe that overzealous restrictions are causing severe economic pain . For these groups , masks can be a symbol of a disagreement that goes much deeper than whether someone has a piece of cloth over their face .\n\u201c The wearing of masks is morphing into an unnecessary and unhealthy political test in which your face is the bumper sticker. \u201d \u2014 Jim Galloway , Atlanta Journal Constitution\n\u201c The way we do things is right . The way others do things is wrong . Usually the gulf between the two is a matter merely of frustration ; now it \u2019 s also a matter of fear . And for those of us who are told we \u2019 re not being careful enough when we \u2019 re convinced we \u2019 re being very careful indeed , it \u2019 s a matter of resentment tinged with guilt. \u201d \u2014 Molly Roberts , Washington Post\nMasks are symbolic of big government control to some people\n\u201c The decision not to wear a mask has , for some , become a rebellion against what they regard as an incursion on their personal liberties. \u201d \u2014 Rick Rojas , New York Times\nTrump \u2019 s strategy of reopening the country made masks a political statement\n\u201c Trump has apparently decided that the way out of the current crisis is to be bold about reopening as quickly as possible in as many places as possible . \u2026 So we can expect to see the president out and about around the country , projecting confidence in the nation \u2019 s health and resilience . And that is what he is modeling by not wearing a mask. \u201d \u2014 Ron Elving , NPR", "Remember when the scariest kid in your neighborhood was the football jock who terrorized the high school with his minions in tow , and got bailed out by his rich parents when he went too far ? Or it was the gothic malcontent with the switchblade and the swagger . Either way , what made these high-status alphas so terrifying was that they came at you in numbers . They travelled in packs . This has been our narrative , in the stories we tell\u2014from Henry Bowers in Stephen King \u2019 s It , to Biff Tannen in Back to the Future , to Billy Hargrove in Stranger Things , central-casting bullies attracted followers . They belonged .\nAs any grade eight schoolgirl who \u2019 s been bullied off Instagram can attest , this stereotype still holds . But when it comes to the most dangerous and sociopathic actors , the opposite is true . All three of the young mass shooters who terrorized the United States in recent nationally reported scenes of carnage\u2014Connor Betts in Dayton , Ohio ; Patrick Crusius in El Paso , Texas ; and Santino William Legan in Gilroy , California\u2014acted alone . The old image of the bully as locker-room alpha or goth leader now seems pass\u00e9 . Often , it is the kid who used to be the fictional protagonist , the social outcast , the member of the Losers Club from It , whose face now appears on our screens with a nightmarish empty stare .\nThese recent shooters fit a similar profile . They were outsiders , all seemingly socially awkward , who became emboldened through fringe online communities that act as mutual-support societies for violent malcontents . This phenomenon is fuelled by hate , guns , mental illness and ideological extremism . But there is another factor at play here , too . Before a youth makes the decision to murder , before the gun is stashed in his backpack , before his state of mental health is so deteriorated that he commits the unthinkable , what has happened to him ? It \u2019 s important to remember that these murders are also , in most cases , suicides .\nIn his 2008 article School Shooting as a Culturally Enforced Way of Expressing Suicidal Hostile Intentions , psychiatrist Antonio Preti summarized existing research on school shootings to the effect that \u201c suicidal intent was found in most cases for which there was detailed information on the assailants. \u201d The research also indicated that \u201c among students , homicide perpetrators were more than twice as likely as their victims to have been bullied by their peers , and also were described as loners and poorly integrated into school activities\u2026In most of the ascertained cases , perpetrators prepared a well-organized plan , and often communicated details about it to acquaintances or friends , who failed to report threats because they did not consider them serious or were embarrassed or ignorant of where to go for help . The most antisocial peers sometimes approved the plan , sharing the same anger against the stated target of violence . \u201d\nPreti \u2019 s article predated the rise of some of the most notorious web sites\u2014including 8chan , which was shut down this week after several mass shootings were linked to its users . But the nihilistic phenomenon these killers represent predates modern social-media culture . Indeed , it predates digital communication , and even broadcast media more generally .\nIn 1897 , French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim noted that suicides overall were increasing in society . But there were differences among the affected populations , he noticed . Men were more likely than women to commit suicide\u2014though the chances decreased if the man was married and had children . Durkheim observed that social groups that were more religious exhibited lower suicide rates . ( Catholics were less likely to commit suicide than Protestants , for instance . ) Durkheim also noted that many people who killed themselves were young , and that the prevalence of such suicides was linked to their level of social integration : When a person felt little sense of connection or belonging , he could be led to question the value of his existence and end his life .\nDurkheim labelled this form of suicide as \u201c anomic \u201d ( others being \u201c egoistic , \u201d \u201c altruistic \u201d and \u201c fatalistic \u201d ) . Durkheim believed that these feelings of anomie assert themselves with special force at moments when society is undergoing social , political or economic upheaval\u2014especially if such upheavals result in immediate and severe changes to everyday life .\nDurkheim came from a long line of devout Jews . His father , grandfather and great grandfather had all been rabbis . And so even though he chose to pursue an academic career , his experiences taught him to respect the mental and psychological support that religious communities supplied to their members , as well as the role that ritual plays in the regulation of social behavior . In the absence of such regulation , he believed , individuals and even whole societies were at risk of falling into a state of anomie , whereby common values and meanings fall by the wayside . The resulting void doesn \u2019 t provide people with a sense of freedom , but rather rootlessness and despair .\nDurkheim \u2019 s thesis has largely stood the test of time , though other scholars have reformulated it for modern audiences . In his 1955 book The Sane Society , for instance , Erich Fromm wrote that , \u201c in the nineteenth century , the problem was that God is dead . In the twentieth century , the problem is that man is dead. \u201d He described the twentieth century as a period of \u201c schizoid-self alienation , \u201d and worried that men would destroy \u201c their world and themselves because they can not stand any longer the boredom of a meaningless life . \u201d\nIn her 2004 book Rampage : The Social Roots of School Shootings , Katherine Newman described findings gleaned from over 100 interviews in Arkansas and Kentucky . The male adolescent shooters at the center of her study , she concluded , \u201c shared a belief that demonstrating strength by planned attacks on their respective institutions with ( too ) easily available guns would somehow mitigate their unbearable feelings of inadequacy as males and bring longed-for respect from peers. \u201d Ten years later , in a 2014 article titled The Socioemotional Foundations of Suicide : A Microsociological View of Durkheim \u2019 s Suicide , sociologists Seth Abrutyn and Anna Mueller set out to update Durkheim \u2019 s theory about how social integration and moral regulation affect suicidality . \u201c The greater degree to which individuals feel they have failed to meet expectations and others fail to \u2018 reintegrate \u2019 them , the greater the feelings of shame and , therefore , anomie , \u201d they concluded . \u201c The risk of suicidal thoughts , attempts , and completions , in addition to violent aggression toward specific or random others , is a positive function of the intensity , persistence , and pervasiveness of identity , role , or status-based shame and anomie . \u201d\nWriting in the 1890s , Durkheim was highly conscious of all the ways that industrial capitalism corroded traditional forms of social regulation in society , often at the expense of religious\u2014and even governmental\u2014authorities . ( \u201c Depuis un sie\u0300cle , en effet , le progre\u0300s e\u0301conomique a principalement consiste\u0301 a\u0300 affranchir les relations industrielles de toute re\u0301glementation . Jusqu \u2019 a\u0300 des temps re\u0301cents , tout un syste\u0300me de pouvoirs moraux avait pour fonction de les discipliner\u2026En effet , la religion a perdu la plus grande partie de son Empire . Le pouvoir gouvernemental , au lieu d \u2019 e\u0302tre le re\u0301gulateur de la vie e\u0301conomique , en est devenu l \u2019 instrument et le serviteur. \u201d ) But if he were to visit us in 2019 , Durkheim would be surprised at the extent to which once-dominant ideas with no connection to economics have been marginalized as regressive and hateful\u2014such as nationalism , patriotism and even masculinity .\nThis is one reason why so many people now feel unmoored . As Canadian science fiction writer Donald Kingsbury eloquently put it in his novel Courtship Rite , \u201c Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems . Throw away the solution and you get the problem back. \u201d Faith in god , country and manhood might be seen as regressive by modern lights . But insofar as they were holding back male anomie , we perhaps neglected to consider what damage would be done if we discredited those ideas before finding replacements .\nIn the history of our species , there has never been ( to the knowledge of modern scholars ) a human society that did not express belief in some sort of supernatural force\u2014which suggests that we are programmed by a need to believe in something bigger than ourselves . Sociologist Max Weber warned in 1919 that \u201c science deals with facts . It can \u2019 t tell us what to do or what \u2019 s important. \u201d This is to say that while the scientific revolution did a good job of helping us explain and harness the natural world , it did nothing to fill the god-shaped hole that Blaise Pascal identified in the 17th-century : \u201c What else does this craving , and this helplessness , proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness , of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace ? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him , seeking in things that are not there the help he can not find in those that are , though none can help , since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object ; in other words by God himself . \u201d\nIf we are to resign ourselves to the fact that \u201c God himself \u201d isn \u2019 t going to intercede any time soon , then we are left with the ordinary tools of policy , such as Robert Putnam outlined in his famous 2000 book , Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of the American Community , in which he pointed to the value of \u201c the connections among individuals \u2019 social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. \u201d These connections could be strengthened , Putnam argued , through improved civics education , more extra-curricular activities for youth , smaller schools , family-oriented workplaces , a more enlightened approach to urbanism , technology that reinforces rather than replaces face-to-face interaction , as well as a decentralization of political power . These recommendations were written 19 years ago , before Facebook , Twitter or 4chan existed . It would be interesting to know how he would revise his recommendations now that we have a better appreciation for the massive effects of digital culture on our social dynamics .\nIn a 2017 article I wrote , titled Towards a Theory of Virtual Sentiments , I argued that real-time empathy generation often requires some degree of eye contact\u2014which is hard to generate through online interaction . Moreover , it is shockingly easy to get worked up into a rage when you are interacting with an online avatar of a person you have never met . Simply put , the more we physically see each other , the less likely we are to be awful to each other . As Louis CK said in an interview about youth and technology , \u201c They don \u2019 t look at people when they talk to them and they don \u2019 t build empathy . You know , kids are mean , and it \u2019 s cause they \u2019 re trying it out . They look at a kid and they go , \u2018 You \u2019 re fat , \u2019 and then they see the kid \u2019 s face scrunch up and they go , \u2018 Oh , that doesn \u2019 t feel good to make a person do that. \u2019 But when they write \u2018 You \u2019 re fat \u2019 [ online ] then they just go , \u2018 Mmm , that was fun , I like that. \u2019 \u201d Even putting aside the extreme cases of forums that cater to homicidal shooters , I remain unconvinced that any community that exists primarily in online form can be a force for long-term good . Perhaps more time offline is a good start for anyone seeking to enhance \u201c the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness . \u201d\nDo we need a new nationalism ? A new religion ? What common human project can we collectively embrace that gives a sense of mission to everyone , regardless of skin color , religion , economic class or ideology ? It would be presumptuous for me to suggest I have the answers . All I know is that men who see human life as meaningless are symptoms of a larger sense of anomie that , in less dramatic and destructive form , increasingly grips us all .\nTerry Newman is currently an MA student in the Sociology Department at Concordia University in Montreal .

Communism is seen across the political spectrum as discredited . However , given the rising popularity of Democratic Socialists , the memes that Marx birthed could see a revival . If Neo-Marxists can offer a compelling narrative and escape the capitulation and nihilism of Accelerationist thought , they might be able to piggy-back on the DSA \u2019 s popularity . Watch for Douglas Lain \u2019 s Zero Books imprint to capitalize on this opportunity .\nEven without identifiable chieftains , Antifa has played an important part in the culture war and continues to benefit from people \u2019 s fear of Trump and dissatisfaction with mainstream responses . Watch for the normalization of a violent offline culture war .\nThe tribe that coalesced around radical leftism , hope , and physical presence has been shattered . Dormant , it lives on in the 99 % meme and in the pages of Adbusters .\nThe drama of the Bernie campaign and dissatisfaction with the lack of leftism in the Democratic Party has led to a surge in a radical wing of the American left . The ironic fringe still rests at the top of the podcasts , and the push for mainstreaming socialism has been growing ever since Trump \u2019 s election . Watch for further infighting with Social Justice Activists .\nIn reaction to the polarization and catastrophizing they see on both the left and right , this nascent tribe has coalesced around the idea that the world is in fact improving , and whatever challenges society faces can be solved through the institutions and values we currently hold . Watch for an increased presence as neoliberalism converts libertarians and shifts to be embraced as a contrarian ideology .\nThe zeitgeist of our times gives the palpable sense that the establishment left and right are dramatically on the decline , especially amongst millennials and Generation Z . Those in power within the establishment are experiencing increased pressure from rapidly rising elements within their parties . Democratic and liberal parties worldwide are contending with socialist and far-left elements . Conservative parties have seen populists and illiberal democrats take over . And everyone , everywhere , has been blindsided by the rise of white identitarian and nationalist elements . Watch for these tribes to make a last grasp at power during the 2020 elections .\nThe atheist tribes are indirect participants in the culture war .

Watch for a popularity boost to Effective Altruism , a struggle with the downsides of increased attention , and possible pressure from the SJAs for the Rationalists to commit to progressive values .\nThis is another observer tribe , and possibly the most interesting one . If the rationalist motto is \u201c the map is not the territory , but it is important to create the most accurate map possible , \u201d then the post-rationalist motto is \u201c the canvas is not the territory , but it is important to create the most interesting canvas possible. \u201d This observer tribe has the potential to generate innovative solutions to the seemingly intractable problem of the differend .\nKen Wilber , who lost some momentum in his \u201c Wyatt Earp \u201d incident , is steadily gaining a strong following amongst cultural influencers . Like the Rationalists and Post-Rationalists , Integralists are an observer tribe . Unlike them , they have a teleological narrative that instills existential hope . This will be a tribe to watch if it moves away from its observer capacity and becomes more active in the war .\nJordan Peterson is the common denominator of these two tribes . One of the most important figures in Culture War 2.0 , his central message emphasizes free speech and the importance of truth-speaking . His following of mostly young men , which we dub the Sorters , are attracted to Peterson \u2019 s style and message of personal responsibility . The \u201c Intellectual Dark Web , \u201d coined by Eric Weinstein , consists of thinkers who have experienced what they view as thought-policing by politically correct elements of the left . With the ever-increasing popularity of Peterson \u2019 s brand and related platforms such as Quillette , the Rubin Report , and the Joe Rogan Experience , watch for both of these tribes to gain members and make a strong push for a return to a classically liberal center in our culture .\nWith a religious right increasingly subservient to Trump , it is becoming incumbent for Christians who put faith first to organize collectively . This memetic tribe is aware of its own mortality and is putting survival before the culture war . Watch for a siphoning of disillusioned Christians and rightists .\nThe religious right is quickly transitioning into a nationalist right . The culture war goals of the Moral Majority have largely been set aside in favor of punishing the left via Trump . Unless there is a public evangelist revival , watch for this tribe to dissolve into Trumpists and Benedictines over the next few years .\nSince its decline following the 2013 government shutdown , this tribe has largely been subsumed by the Trumpists . Watch for a continued decline in libertarian activism as believers drift towards Trump or neoliberalism .\nThis new tribe makes up for a lack of experience and policy through power and \u201c high energy. \u201d They are engaged in a fight for control over the mainstream perception of conservatism with a blindsided establishment right . Watch for a push for votes from racial minorities and a scramble to stay in line with Trump \u2019 s thought .\nThese are the conspiracy theory tribes of the culture war . Alex Jones and Infowars represent \u201c established \u201d conspiracies such as the New World Order and Illuminati . With his manic energy , Jones has successfully turned conspiracy into a profitable business . QAnon is a grassroots emergence of conspiracy theories originating on /pol/ . Given the intense passion their reality tunnel engenders , we speculate that QAnon will grow amongst Trumpists and will be censored on social media platforms , which will only further fuel its growth .\nThese three tribes are concerned with issues surrounding white people and are often lumped together by the mainstream media , but they are actively fighting amongst themselves ( \u201c punching right \u201d ) in order to create distance and avoid conflation . The Alt-Lite would be quick to point out that they are less defined by white identity and more by western chauvinism , an unapologetic view that western culture is the best . Watch for massive fluctuations and changes in the composition of all three , and a continued fight amongst themselves to gain adherents .\nThis semi-dormant tribe has partly been subsumed into the Alt-Right . Lack of public direction from its key figures has led to a decline in influence . Watch for Nick Land \u2019 s return to the blogosphere and keep an eye on Social Matter and the Hestia Society for a potential revival .\nLike the dissident right tribes , these masculine tribes are usually lumped together . Like the far-right tribes , these masculinist tribes also signal to create distance from each other . The Manosphere , the largest of the three tribes , reached its peak around Gamergate and has lost momentum due to its lack of a non-hedonistic strategy , and due to men \u2019 s attention being divided by the competing message of Jordan Peterson . See a continued declined with these three groups , unless new voices emerge .\nThese self-described involuntary celibates could be placed in the masculinist cluster if not for their view of themselves as having been \u201c black-pilled \u201d instead of \u201c red-pilled. \u201d They agree with most of the descriptive views of the masculinist tribes , but see their situation as radically hopeless and unfair . The more extreme adherents have a belief space that shares more with terrorist groups like ISIS than any of the memetic tribes listed above . Copycat attacks mimicking Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian might grow in number unless a memeplex emerges that can inspire and provide meaning to sexually unsuccessful males in society .\nWe conclude this white paper by offering speculative proposals that are not meant to treat the culture war as a solvable problem , but as an opportunity for personal and collective growth .\nWe view the noosphere as an emergent phenomenon , a consequence of globalization and digitalization . When Pierre Teilhard de Chardin introduced the term , he adopted a teleological perspective and saw the collective consciousness of humanity developing towards an \u201c Omega Point. \u201d While we are agnostic about whether there is an endpoint , we do think that looking at the noosphere as being in the process of evolution can help with regards to making speculative proposals . In this section we shift our focus from seeing memetic tribes as individual entities to viewing them as fragments of the larger noosphere .\nBruce Tuckman , a psychology researcher in group dynamics , established his famous \u201c stages of group development \u201d model in 1965 . He believed that there were four necessary stages that newly formed groups need to progress through in order to tackle their shared challenges . The first stage is forming , when a team first comes together and individuals , mainly focused on themselves , operate with a degree of politeness . The second stage is storming , when comfort within the group allows for conflicting opinions to be voiced . Team members may wrestle for control of the group \u2019 s values and goals . The third stage is norming , when \u201c resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy , and a spirit of cooperation emerges. \u201d The fourth stage is performing , where , with \u201c group norms and roles established , group members focus on achieving common goals , often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success . \u201d\nNot all groups are successful . Some abort during the storming phase \u2014 and if we apply this model to the noosphere , we see that all the memetic tribes are in the midst of it . The emergent collective consciousness of the internet began as the relatively innocent forming stage of Web 1.0 . Now that we are in the storming phase , we are plagued by mobs , trolls , and doxxing .\nIf we are to survive as a species , we must address our collective challenges and existential risks \u2014 from rogue A.I . to environmental disaster . To do so , we \u2019 re going to have to build the bridge from storming to norming . This norming phase may not involve feel-good utopianism , but it must involve deep negotiations and compromises between tribes , or alternatively , a peaceful geopolitical instantiation of the growing memetic divides .\nThese eight speculative proposals are meant as a launching pad for discussion . They are not proposals for government or corporate policy . Rather , they are ideas for readers to explore , small but meaningful steps to push against the overwhelming whirlwind of the culture war . It is our hope that interested minds and entrepreneurial spirits will take these proposals and advance them further .\nThe Hippocratic Oath was an oath that physicians were required to take before they began practicing medicine . Its modern iteration is a rite of passage for graduates of some medical schools . While today the oath is not a binding contract , there is a degree of ritualistic magic in formally committing to ideals . Could there be a Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath ? One that chieftains of the memetic tribes could affirm ? It would prove beneficial if journalists , authors , bloggers , and professors alike took this oath , but any social media user could take the oath , by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e-badge . Promises can be broken , but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback .\nWhat would this Oath consist of ? At the bare minimum : a commitment to good faith dialogue , the principle of charity , and intellectual humility . The last virtue is critical . A caveat of \u201c I could be wrong \u201d underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult conversations , a shared commitment to that caveat helps even more . If enough culture warriors take such an Oath , it could pave the way for a Geneva Convention of the Culture War .\nIt is increasingly hard for media outlets to approximate \u201c performative neutrality , \u201d thanks to the perverse incentives of outrage porn and the need to appease dwindling subscribers for survival . Is there a way to satisfy the collective hunger for \u201c unbiased news \u201d ? While we try to figure that out , cynicism spreads , as rightists increasingly find traditional media \u2019 s claims of neutrality laughable . Is there an alternative ?\nWe could all start by putting our skin in the game , by being honest about our biases and tribal affiliations . We could abandon the pretense to neutrality and more honestly engage with each other , knowing where we stand . Arguments could go to our philosophical foundations more quickly , instead of expending themselves on object-level disagreement .\nWe call this \u201c clean bias , \u201d an admission of an epistemic framework and value structure . It is in contrast to \u201c dirty bias , \u201d unspoken and denied framework and values while purporting universality . Thanks to the reality crisis , we are shedding our faith in universally imposed and agreed-upon truths . Clean bias is a necessary part of a new peace in our fractured reality . A first step could be for memetic creators , from journalists to bloggers , to commit to including their foundational presumptions in their bios .\nDebate is broken . Nobody actually likes \u201c gotcha interviews \u201d or debates plagued with strawmanning , question-begging , bad faith , and side-stepping . Debate needs to be rebuilt . We suggest that debate currently tries to inhabit two contradictory roles . On the one hand , it is a source of entertainment through combat ; On the other , it is an avenue for improved understanding and wisdom . We propose that these two roles should be formally separated into distinct types of debates : Sport Debates and Sensemaking Debates .\nIn Sport Debates , participants debate for combat and entertainment . This would gamify the desire to engage in verbal combat for its own sake , with truth as a potential byproduct . They could be viewed as the UFC of the mind . While it may seem cynical to sponsor an avenue for the fiery and often toxic form debates can take , we think that diverting those urges away from sensemaking desires is a good harm-reduction strategy .\nIn Sensemaking Debates , participants debate for understanding and exploration . This would allow the purported values of debate to actually flourish . This can also include philosophical sandboxing , the adoption of ideologies as a method actor . Spaces could be made where participants take on ideological roles so as to better understand them , and to develop the skill to take them off .\nDavid Brin \u2019 s idea of \u201c Disputation Arenas \u201d and William MacAskill \u2019 s \u201c Anti-Debates \u201d can map over to the two types of debates , with Bryan Caplan \u2019 s \u201c Ideological Turing Test \u201d as another potential modality that falls somewhere between both types . Peter , the co-author of this white paper , has been experimenting with both of these debate modalities inside his Intellectual Explorers Club . He welcomes suggestions and participants .\nDue to technological innovation , industries are being disrupted the world-over , from the sharing economy to AI developments . We suggest that it is time for philosophy to endure similar disruptions . In Disabling Professions , Ivan Illich argues that professionalization can have a damaging effect on society , as expert culture induces knowledge-distance , blindness , and reliance on experts by non-experts . While Illich \u2019 s focus was the medical establishment , this also applies to philosophy , which has been inaccessible to most non-professionals for decades . This has in turn led to a sense of philosophy \u2019 s irrelevance amongst non-academics .\nBut as practical philosopher Andrew Taggart points out , philosophy is much more than an academic discipline , it is as a way of life : \u201c Philosophy is not theoretical discourse but a way of being . Philosophical discourse , accordingly , appears only when necessary and is always put in the service of leading a certain kind of life. \u201d Indeed , we are seeing the beginnings of a reclaiming of philosophy as a way of life in the new popularity of the longform podcast and of philosophies of virtue , such as Stoicism .\nOur hope is that with these and other disruptions to the philosophical status quo , people will gain the tools to think critically and avoid being drawn into convenient and prepackaged worldviews . Philosophy could be a guard against the pressure to join an existing memetic tribe . R.J. Hollingdale \u2019 s aphorism may come to fruition : \u201c If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones . \u201d\nA new role might be required in the Culture War , that of the Memetic Mediator . This mediator would be a pan-tribalist participant who has the ability to communicate across tribes in a way that seems fair and reasonable to each tribe . They would have the mental agility , empathy , and wisdom needed to shift between a multitude of perspectives .\nMemetic mediators could be called in for memetic battles where both participants prefer peace to continued civil decay , but can not come to an accord without facilitation . These mediators would require a multitude of tools at their disposal . They would need to be fluent in multiple tribal paradigms and give the impression of fairness . And because each tribe has their own method and claims to truth , Memetic Mediators would have to be skilled at finding any common ground and building from it .\nAs we do not have an existing example to point to , we can only speculate that the role will emerge out of necessity in the coming war . They could even emerge as consultants for social media companies .\nVenkatesh Rao has introduced the term \u201c grey pilling , \u201d which he views as the third pill in the blue-red pill dichotomy . Blue pills are unquestioned consensus realities we are socialized into . A red pill , as Venkatesh puts it , is :\na dose of information that awakens you to the existence of a world beyond the one you are unconsciously immersed in , like a fish being taken out of water . Red-pill moments sensitize you to the previously invisible boundaries and structural lies of the world you knew , and make you alive to astounding possibilities beyond it .\nA grey pill , according to Venkatesh , is the process of \u201c relearning the value of questioning and doubt after you \u2019 ve been seduced by answers and certainties ; it \u2019 s leaving comforting \u2018 secret \u2019 societies for continued intellectual growth. \u201d Grey pills can engender an existential crisis , but at the right dose they can provide a confident unknowing and a sexy uncertainty , what Stephen Fry calls \u201c passionate and positive doubt. \u201d In a world of tyrannical certainty , grey pilling may be an ethical act .\nIn 1964 , Ken Kesey , smitten with the experience that LSD provided him , drove around the country with his Merry Band of Pranksters and offered \u201c acid tests \u201d to anyone they could find with the intent to open minds and transform the consciousness of society . Some may argue that they were successful in doing so , as his adventures chronicled in Tom Wolfe \u2019 s book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test are credited with giving birth to the hippie movement . What if we grey-pilled the way Kesey acid-tested ?\nThis would be the return of Socrates , the original gadfly , who grey-pilled anyone who dared to converse with him . The method of the Street Epistemologists are instructive and may be repurposed for this proposal . Their conversational method of innocently starting dialog is well-structured , but instead of atheists inquiring into the epistemic methodology of their \u201c irrational \u201d interlocutors , performative agnostics could inquire with the intention to get mutually , philosophically lost . This may be our most dangerous , and most fun , speculation .\nManagement theorist Robert Katz made a distinction between three critical skills for professional success : technical skills , conceptual skills , and human skills . Technical skills are practical skill-sets that can be mastered . Conceptual skills are effective ways of thinking about complex problems . And human skills can be understood as the ability to connect with what is \u201c human \u201d about another person . While the \u201c marketing mentality \u201d invokes the need for social skills , which are instrumental towards salesmanship or leadership persuasion , \u201c human skills \u201d invokes the framework of authentic relationships with other humans . It has the potential to lend itself to a non-instrumental view of relationships . In Buberian terms , this is a movement from an I-It way of relating to one of I-Thou .\nThe Authentic Relating and Circling Movement aims to cultivate WE Spaces , which are intersubjective I-Thou spaces where collective consciousness can emerge . For individuals concerned by their own culpability in the Culture War , these spaces give an opportunity to develop Human Skills . We speculate that if one becomes skilled at relating to another for its own sake , across tribal affiliation , it may allow people to bypass tribalistic affinities and a Protean Tribalism to emerge . One \u2019 s tribe would be fluid and context-based , in contrast to the increasingly rigid identities we currently find comfort in .\nThe Culture War is a vicious cycle \u2014 those who suffer from it feel they have to perpetuate it . Initiating conversations about alternatives can be the start of a positive feedback loop . Individuals looking to improve the atmosphere in their communities could initiate workshops to that end .\nA promising example to this end is the OpenMind platform . As per its website , \u201c OpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses , companies , organizations , and communities . OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding , while equipping them with the essential cognitive skills to engage constructively across differences. \u201d A combination of online program and workshop , OpenMind is one avenue to develop viewpoint diversity and diffuse political tensions in relationships . Any organized , good faith approach to repairing fraying communities is likely to have a positive effect .", "Manson and his \u2018 family \u2019 became notorious for the murder of Sharon Tate and six others during the summer of 1969\nCharles Manson , the pseudo-satanic sociopath behind a string of killings that shocked California out of its late 1960s cultural reverie , died on Sunday after almost a half century in prison .\nThe 83-year-old , who died of natural causes , had been serving multiple life sentences in state prison in Corcoran , California , for orchestrating the violence in 1969 that claimed the lives of Sharon Tate , the heavily pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski , and six others .\nWhile his death prompted the inevitable and renewed questioning around why his grim notoriety had been so enduring , Michele Hanisee , president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County , said : \u201c Today , Manson \u2019 s victims are the ones who should be remembered and mourned on the occasion of his death . \u201d\nShe went on to quote the late Vincent Bugliosi , the prosecutor who put Manson behind bars , who had said : \u201c Manson was an evil , sophisticated conman with twisted and warped moral values . \u201d\nAs the leader of a cult known as the Manson Family , Manson had instructed his followers , made up mostly of disaffected young women , to carry out the killings . The brutality of the murders set Los Angeles on edge , and ended the sunny optimism of the 60s counterculture and its aspirations to a new society built on peace and love . Manson presented himself as a demonic force : at trial , he carved a Nazi swastika into his forehead .\nThe five received the death penalty but were spared when capital punishment was temporarily abolished following a ruling by the supreme court in 1972 .\nManson and three female followers , Susan Atkins , Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten , were convicted of murder and conspiracy to murder . Another defendant , Charles \u201c Tex \u201d Watson , was convicted later .\nThe second summer of Charles Manson : why the cult murders still grip us Read more\nTate , the wife of Polanski , who was out of the country the night of her murder , was eight and a half months pregnant when Manson \u2019 s followers broke into her home in Los Angeles . They stabbed and shot Tate and her visitors , Jay Sebring , Voytek Frykowski , coffee heiress Abigail Folger and Steven Parent . The word \u201c Pig \u201d was written in blood on the front door . Tate , who had starred in The Valley of the Dolls , was stabbed 16 times , and an \u201c X \u201d was carved into her stomach .\nThe next night , his followers murdered couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca .\nAlthough the followers committed the murders , Manson had ordered them . At the LaBianca home , he tied up the couple before leaving others to carry out the killings .\nAfter his death on Sunday night , Tate \u2019 s sister Debra told NBC : \u201c One could say I \u2019 ve forgiven them , which is quite different than forgetting what they are capable of . It is for this reason I fight so hard to make sure that each of these individuals stays in prison until the end of their natural days . \u201d\nIn the 2004 book Sharon Tate Recollection , Polanski wrote : \u201c Even after so many years , I find myself unable to watch a spectacular sunset or visit a lovely old house or experience visual pleasure of any kind without instinctively telling myself how much she would have loved it all . \u201d\nProsecutors at the time said Manson and his cult were trying to spark a race war that he believed was foretold in the Beatles song Helter Skelter , and hoped the Black Panthers would be blamed for the killings .\nBefore the murders , Manson spent most of his teens and 20s in and out of prison , and he later became a singer-songwriter . He got a break in the music industry when he met the Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson . The group later recorded Never Learn Not to Love , which Manson had written .\nHe became friends with the Byrds producer Terry Melcher ( the son of Doris Day ) and even recorded 13 folksy songs for an album that eventually was titled Lie : The Love and Terror Cult ; it was released in March 1970 to help pay for his defense .\nManson had established himself as a would-be cult leader in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco . He took a handful of followers , some of whom would later be convicted in the killings , to the old Spahn Movie Ranch north of LA and turned it into a hedonistic commune .\nVan Houten , the youngest member of the original Manson Family , later said that Manson had used sex , LSD , Bible readings , repeated playing of the Beatles \u2019 White Album and rambling lectures about triggering a revolution to brainwash her .\nVan Houten , 68 , was convicted of the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca . She was recommended for parole in September but California \u2019 s governor , Jerry Brown , has yet to approve the recommendation . He rejected an earlier decision , concluding that Van Houten posed \u201c an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison \u201d .\nIn June , officials denied a parole request by Krenwinkel , the state \u2019 s longest-serving female prisoner , after her attorney said she had been abused by Manson or another person . She has been denied parole multiple times in the past .\nManson \u2019 s lawyer , Irving Kanarek , claimed his client was innocent during a 2014 interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c No question he was legally innocent . And , more than that , he was actually innocent , \u201d Kanarek said , arguing that there was no evidence connecting him to the case .\nAt a 2012 parole hearing , which was denied , Manson was quoted as having said to one of his prison psychologists : \u201c I \u2019 m special . I \u2019 m not like the average inmate . I have spent my life in prison . I have put five people in the grave . I am a very dangerous man . \u201d\nAccording to the LA Times , Manson committed hundreds of rules violations while being held at the Corcoran state prison , including assault , repeated possession of a weapon and threatening staff . Officials said he has spat in guards \u2019 faces , started fights , tried to cause a flood and set his mattress ablaze .\nIn 2014 , Manson and Afton Elaine Burton , a 26-year-old Manson devotee , were granted a marriage license , but it expired before the two could marry . She had faithfully visited him in prison for seven years . Manson had been denied parole 12 times , with his next hearing set for 2027 .\nHis death is unlikely to end interest in his crimes . Quentin Tarantino is believed to be preparing a film that uses the murders as a backdrop for its main plot , and an adaptation of Emma Cline \u2019 s bestselling 2016 novel , The Girls , is on the way .\nWriter Joan Didion interviewed Linda Kasabian , the Manson family member who acted as a lookout in the Tate and LaBianca killings and later gave evidence at the trial , and described the atmosphere in Hollywood in an essay from her collection The White Album ( 1979 ) .\n\u201c Everything was unmentionable but nothing was unimaginable\u2026 \u201d Didion wrote . \u201c A demented and seductive vortical tension was building in the community . The jitters were setting in . I recall a time when the dogs barked every night and the moon was always full .\nReached at home in Manhattan , Didion , 82 , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c Manson \u2019 s legacy was never obvious to me . It wasn \u2019 t obvious when I went to talk with Linda Kasabian , and it isn \u2019 t obvious to me now . But I do find it easy to put him from my mind . \u201d\nIn 2008 , California officials ordered the search of a deserted ranch in Death Valley where Manson and his family briefly resided . The search turned up no evidence of human remains .\nManson may be gone but the persistence of his dark vision endures . \u201c I am crime , \u201d he proclaimed in a telephone call to the New York Post from prison in the mid-2000s .", "Donald Trump likes to deliver big promises on infrastructure . Delivering an actual infrastructure plan , though , is a different matter . ( Sound familiar ? ) Trump \u2019 s problem is that while strengthening the nation \u2019 s infrastructure would be very popular with voters , who would benefit from the improved transit and water systems and new schools and the millions of jobs that would come from repairing or building all of that , Republican politicians are not interested in making rich people pay for any of that . ( Trump , you may recall , is a Republican politician . ) Also , Trump \u2019 s strong suit has not exactly been delivering workable plans to fulfill his positive campaign promises . He \u2019 s good at signing orders and bills undoing things President Obama did , but he \u2019 s not so good at coming up with his own policies , from health care to infrastructure .\nAnd so Trump keeps talking about infrastructure in his speeches :\nBut at this point , White House spokesman Sean Spicer has only said the Trump Administration is in the \u201c beginning phases \u201d of putting together an infrastructure plan \u2013 which means there is no legislative text ready for action in the Congress .\nThere have been indications that any infrastructure bill coming out of the Trump White House will be less about investing in America and more about gutting environmental regulations and selling roads and bridges off to corporations , but at this point even that is extremely hazy , and while Republicans seem content about it , Democrats are getting impatient :\n\u201c Every conversation or any interaction I have had with the president has been infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure , \u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said at a news conference last week . \u201c Where 's the bill ? Show us the bill . \u201d\nDemocrats would love a real infrastructure bill that put people to work repairing or replacing crumbling bridges , building tunnels to improve transit in congested areas\u2014you could list important projects pretty much all day . But with Trump \u2019 s popularity and credibility in the basement , Democrats don \u2019 t seem like they plan to roll over and gratefully accept a massive privatizing giveaway to the wealthy . And Trump\u2014or at least some of the people around him\u2014may realize that continuing to talk vaguely about a popular idea serves his ego more as an applause line than unveiling a disappointing betrayal of an actual plan would . Don \u2019 t hold your breath on a solid infrastructure plan that Congress could vote on , in other words .", "Story highlights `` Too early to conclude pilot error , '' NTSB chief says\nThe agency is also looking to see if the plane 's computer was handling landing\nSaturday marked the pilot 's first time landing a Boeing 777 at the San Francisco airport\nAsiana Airlines Flight 214 was flying far slower than recommended as it approached San Francisco International Airport just before its crash landing on Saturday , the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday .\nThe Boeing 777 was traveling at approximately 106 knots ( 122 mph ) upon impact and at about 118 knots ( 136 mph ) 16 seconds before impact at an altitude of about 200 feet ; the recommended speed upon approach to the runway threshold is 137 knots ( 157 mph ) , Deborah Hersman told reporters .\nThe onboard systems warned the crew the plane was about to stall four seconds before the crash , she said .\nThat warning comes in the form of a `` stick-shaker , '' said Arthur Rosenberg , a pilot , engineer and partner with the New York-based law firm Soberman & Rosenberg , which specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes . `` It 's basically saying , 'Hey idiot , wake up and do something ... Now ! ''\nThat something typically is to lower the nose of the plane and apply power , he said .\nJUST WATCHED Young plane crash survivors speak Replay More Videos ...

But the crew apparently boosted the power to the engines , which were increasing from 50 % capacity three seconds before impact , according to Hersman .\nOne-and-a-half seconds before impact , the crew called for a `` go-around , '' meaning that they wanted to abort the landing and go around in the air to try to make another landing , she said .\nBut they did n't make it . `` There just was n't enough room to recover , '' Rosenberg said .\nInvestigators have found a path of wreckage that started at the seawall and continued to the main wreckage site hundreds of feet up the runway , Hersman added .\nThe pavement itself was scarred from contact with the landing gear , the engines and the fuselage , Hersman said .\nThe tail 's lower portion was in the rocks at the seawall and `` a significant piece of the tail '' was in the water , she said . Additional aircraft parts were visible at low tide . On the path that leads along the pavement away from the seawall were horizontal stabilizers , a vertical stabilizer and an upper portion of the tail cone , she said .\nThe air-traffic control team found no evidence on voice communications of any distress calls before the accident , she said .\nBut investigators have found that the pilots had the appropriate charts for the airport and approach in place in the cockpit , she added . The NTSB was working to find out what the four pilots had done during the 72 hours before the crash in an attempt to determine whether fatigue or sickness may have played a role , she said .\nA preliminary review of FAA radar data indicates that there was `` no abnormally steep descent curve that 's been detected '' in the landing approach of the jet , she said , reacting to media reports citing a steeper descent .\nAnd a preliminary review of the engines indicates that both engines were producing power when the plane crashed , she said .\nInvestigators were focusing on the crew and aircraft as they try to learn why the giant jet clipped the end of runway before crashing , she had said earlier in the day .\n`` We 're certainly looking at the crew and how they operated , how they were trained , at their experience , '' Hersman told CNN 's New Day .\n`` We 're also looking at the aircraft . We 're looking to see if the crew was using automation or was flying on autopilot , or they were hand-flying the airplane , '' she said .\nBoeing 777s can land automatically , but it was unclear if the plane 's computer was handling Saturday 's attempted landing or if it was being done by the pilot , who Asiana said was making his first San Francisco landing at the controls of that model of aircraft .\nThe flight , with 307 people on board , originated in Shanghai , China , and stopped in Seoul , South Korea . It was preparing to land Saturday in San Francisco when the rear of the plane struck the edge of the runway , severing the tail . Most passengers were able to escape before the plane erupted in smoke and flames .\nJUST WATCHED Up-close look at crash scene Replay More Videos ...

''\nLee Kang-kuk , the pilot who was in the captain 's seat of Flight 214 , had flown from Seoul to San Francisco several times between 1999 and 2004 , the airline said .\nBut Saturday marked his first time landing a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport and was the ninth time he had flown the model , with 43 hours at the controls , the airline said . He has about 10,000 hours as a pilot , Asiana said .\nHersman , who has discouraged speculation about whether the crew bore responsibility for the crash , downplayed the significance of the pilot 's experience in her New Day interview .\n`` It 's not unusual for crew to change aircraft types , '' she said . And with air crews flying all around the world , it 's not unusual for pilots to fly into unfamiliar airports for the first time either .\nShe said it 's important for the two pilots in charge of the aircraft during the `` very risky '' landing phase to work closely together , and while she said investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems , it 's something investigators will be looking at .\nMary Schiavo , a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation , said video and other data related to the crash suggest the crew `` lost situational awareness '' while approaching the airport .\n`` They 're low and slow , and that 's a problem , '' Schiavo said .\nAll four pilots have been interviewed by NTSB and South Korean investigators , said Choi Jeong-ho , the head of South Korea 's Aviation Policy Bureau .\n`` We can not reveal what 's been said as it is an ongoing investigation , '' Choi said .\nThe pilots represented two teams -- a crew and a relief crew , said Hersman .\n`` I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error , because there is so much that we do n't know , '' she told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .\nThe cockpit voice recorder -- which has been flown to Washington for analysis -- contains conversations between the pilots that were carried out in a combination of English and Korean , she said .\nHersman said that in most airplane crashes , investigators rarely find a single explanation for what went wrong .\n`` In most of our investigations , we find that it 's not just one thing , it really is a combination of factors that lead to an accident , '' she said .\nWhile weather has been ruled out as a factor , other factors officials are investigating include whether construction at the airport may have played a role , Hersman said Sunday .\nWork to extend a runway safety area required the temporary shutdown of a system designed to help pilots land planes safely , she said .\nThe pilots apparently tried to speed up seven seconds before the crash , cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed .\nA stall warning sounded three seconds later , telling the pilots the plane was about to lose its ability to stay in the air .\nThen -- just 1.5 seconds before the plane slammed into the runway -- the crew decided to call off the landing and try to pull up for another try , Hersman said .\nWith no warning from the cockpit , survivors said , the plane 's rear struck the sea wall at the end of the runway . The impact severed the plane 's tail and sent the rest of the body spinning on its belly .\nIn addition to the two deaths , 182 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe scrapes to paralysis .\n`` We 're lucky there has n't been a greater loss of life , '' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said .\nSome injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday , including six in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital , said Dr. Margaret Knudson , the hospital 's chief of surgery .\nAbout half of those admitted to the hospital had spinal fractures , she said . Others have head trauma .\n`` Their recovery could be months and months and maybe not even to full recovery , '' she said .\nMany of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft , Knudson said .\nBut 123 of the 307 people on board walked away uninjured . Benjamin Levy was among them .\n`` Honestly , I was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down , in which case I think a lot of people would have not made it , '' Levy said .\n`` If we flipped , none of us would be here to talk about it , '' he said .", "The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that slammed into the Alps appears to have practiced for the deadly descent by setting controls to dangerously low altitudes during a flight earlier that day , French investigators said Wednesday .\nThe revelation contained in a 30-page interim report from the French accident investigation agency BEA appeared to support the theory that the crash was deliberate and premeditated .\nThe Airbus 320 co-piloted by Andreas Lubitz crashed in the French Alps on March 24 , killing all 150 people aboard , while on a flight to Duesseldorf , Germany , from Barcelona .\nThe agency said Lubitz set the plane into a descent several times during the earlier flight into Barcelona from Duesseldorf that morning . The plane 's `` selected altitude '' changed repeatedly and several times was set as low as 100 feet above sea level .\nThe report said Lubitz also put the engines on idle , which gives the plane the ability to descend quickly .\nOn the doomed flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf , Lubitz set a 100-foot altitude before the plane crashed into the Alps .\n`` Several altitude selections towards 100 ft. were recorded during descent on the flight that preceded the accident flight , while the co-pilot was alone in the cockpit , '' the preliminary report said .\nAccording to the report , the resetting of automatic flight controls occurred during a four-minute period that begins after sounds picked up on the voice recorder indicate that the pilot had left the cockpit .\nAviation experts say it would be highly unusual for a pilot to repeatedly set a plane for such a low altitude for no apparent reason .\nThe report said Lubitz did so while air traffic controllers were asking him to bring the airplane down gradually from 35,000 feet to 21,000 feet for its descent to Barcelona .\nA BEA chart showed the plane did n't actually descend sharply while Lubitz was repeatedly adjusting the settings , so the passengers and crew might not have noticed any change .\n`` The captain did n't realize at all , because the co-pilot 's tests during the outgoing flight took place during a normal , preprogrammed descent and it never had an impact on the plane 's trajectory , '' said Remi Jouty , the director of BEA\nBecause the plane was already on descent into Barcelona , the setting of 100 feet minimum would not be noticeable to air traffic control or others on the plane . Lubitz kept the plane on this trajectory for about a minute and a half , leveling off at 25,000 feet shortly before the voice recorder notes the return of the pilot .\n`` I ca n't speculate on what was happening inside his head ; all I can say is that he changed this button to the minimum setting of 100 feet and he did it several times , '' Jouty said .\n`` These very brief actions on the previous flight were a sort of rehearsal of the maneuver , '' Jouty said .\nOn the flight that crashed into the Alps , only hours later , French and German prosecutors say Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately steered the plane into a ravine .\nHelmut Tolksdorf , a spokesman for Lufthansa , the parent company of Germanwings , told the Associated Press that the airline had not had time to analyze the new details and planned no immediate comment .\nThe BEA report also showed that the Lufthansa aeromedical center twice turned down Lubitz 's bid for a medical certificate re-validation in April 2009 because of depression and the medication he was taking to treat it , according to DPA , the German news agency .\nWhen he was eventually issued a new certificate in July 2009 , a note was attached specifying that he was required to undergo regular medical examinations . The limitation also required the medical examiner to contact the issuer of the license before conducting an evaluation for a medical certificate renewal .\nLubitz 's most recent medical certificate was issued in July 2014 and was valid until August 2015 .\n`` We are in a situation where the medical problem was known , was investigated and a decision was made , '' Jouty said .\nLubitz , who struggled with depression , had a doctor 's note excusing him from flying the day of the crash , but he had hidden it and been cleared for flying by Germanwings .", "Trump \u2019 s proposal would be a step in the right direction .\nIf you think about the businesses you really hate , you \u2019 ll notice that many of them have something in common : They are in industries with a big federal footprint \u2014 banks , cable companies , health-insurance providers , and , bane of my personal existence , airlines .\nIf the word \u201c capitalism \u201d makes you think of the Apple Store , then it gives you a nice fuzzy Milton Friedman vibe ; if the word \u201c capitalism \u201d makes you think of Wells Fargo \u2019 s shenanigans or trying to get Nasty McEvil Stupidface Health Partners to approve your mom \u2019 s dialysis , then it gives you more of a Karl Marx , Shining Path kind of a feeling .\nAir travel in the United States is terrible , both in absolute terms and relative to air travel in other parts of the world . President Donald Trump has proposed trying to fix one of its defects \u2014 air-traffic control \u2014 by privatizing the activity and entrusting it to a new nonprofit corporation . The model here isn \u2019 t some Rothbardian fantasyland or a hypercapitalist city-state such as Singapore but our nice neighbor to the north , Canada , which keeps out-scoring the United States on the Heritage Foundation \u2019 s economic-liberty rankings in spite of its commie health-care system . Canada \u2019 s air-traffic control is managed by a truly private corporation , Nav Canada , which receives no government funding but instead operates on fees charged to airlines and other flight operators and raises capital in the private markets the same as any other business . It seems to work pretty well , and Nav Canada recently \u2014 get this \u2014 lowered its fees . The Trump administration , taking up legislation authored by Bill Schuster ( R. , Pa. ) , wants to emulate that model in the United States .\nThis is one of those blessed occasions when corporate management ( the airlines ) is on the same side as labor , with the air-traffic controllers \u2019 union friendly toward the idea : Privatization would not change the union \u2019 s status , and the FAA is so screwed up that even American union bosses shake their heads in dismay and disbelief at its incompetence . The main opposition comes from . . . people like Donald Trump , i.e. , the private-jet set and the firms that serve them . The general-aviation crowd fears that the board of the new nonprofit corporation will be too entirely dominated by the big commercial airlines , who may be tempted to use their position to shift some costs onto the smaller and less powerful private-flight industry . A few left-wing ideologues who oppose the privatization of anything also have made it known that air-traffic control falls within the category of \u201c anything , \u201d and that they oppose privatizing it .\nWhile the eternal plight of the private-jet owner must never be far from our thoughts , arranging the new nonprofit corporation in such a way that their interests are not overwhelmed by those of the major carriers ought not be too difficult . It certainly does not represent , on its own , a persuasive argument against privatization .\nIs this proposal an instance of \u201c corporatism \u201d ? Of course it is : Organizing industry and government interests into a cartel in the form of a nonprofit charged with serving the public interest is classical corporatism . Our progressive friends have a great affection for corporatism when it is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , and some of our Chamber of Commerce friends seem to think that they would wither up and die without the Overseas Private Investment Corporation or the Export-Import Bank . But a genuine free-market alternative is not on the table . So , setting aside the question of nomenclature : Is this likely to improve air travel in these United States ? Put another way : Will this corporatist cartel represent an improvement over the current monopoly model ?\nWill this corporatist cartel represent an improvement over the current monopoly model ?\nThe problems with air travel are legion , and there is no single reform that will address all of them . The airlines are part of the problem in that they are poorly managed but big and politically connected enough to protect themselves from more nimble competition ( for example , foreign carriers are prohibited from operating domestic flights within the United States ) , which explains why airline incompetence rather than weather trouble was the biggest cause of flight delays in 2016 , according to the FAA ; the various unions are part of the problem , inflicting work rules on the industry that inhibit innovation and flexibility , contributing to those flight delays by making flight crews unavailable ; antiquated regulation is part of the problem . And the FAA is a big part of the problem , too : Supporters of privatization point out that its defective procurement process means that equipment often is outdated by the time it is installed , and a recent program to modernize its traffic-control practices descended into fiasco . And part of the reason the FAA is a problem is that Congress is part of the problem , with its unsteady budget practices making it difficult for federal agencies to commit convincingly to long-term projects .\nYou know what else is part of the problem ? New York . As recently as 2012 , problems originating in the New York air space accounted for more than half of all flight delays in the United States .\nAir-traffic control is one part of a very big picture , but making it more effective and more efficient would do a great deal to improve the overall functionality of the air-travel system , which would give airlines , airport authorities , and other responsible parties some breathing room to work on their own particular reforms . \u201c Privatization \u201d is a word that warms libertarian hearts , but institutional design matters a great deal here , too : The new private nonprofit will be theoretically accountable to federal regulators , but how that actually works in practice will end up mattering more than whether the new entity is formally private .\nThis is a step in the right direction , and we should take that step \u2014 carefully .", "The Trump administration on Tuesday ended the most popular forms of U.S. travel to Cuba , banning cruise ships and a heavily used category of educational travel in an attempt to cut off cash to the island 's communist government .\nCruise travel from the U.S. to Cuba began in May 2016 during President Barack Obama 's opening with the island .\nIt has become the most popular form of U.S. leisure travel to the island , bringing 142,721 people in the first four months of the year , a more than 300 % increase over the same period last year .\nFor travelers confused about the thicket of federal regulations governing travel to Cuba , cruises offered a simple , one-stop , guaranteed-legal way to travel .\nBanned : Tourists ride inside a vintage car as they pass by the Norwegian Sky cruise ship in Havana . Cruises from U.S ports will be banned from Wednesday\nMassive activity : Tourists such as these near the Majesty of the Seas cruise ship , owned by Royal Caribbean , have become a key part of the Cuban economy - prompting the move by the Trump administration\nLocal concern : In Havana , businesses are concerned that the ban on U.S. cruise tourists will hit their income\n'Cruise ships as well as recreational and pleasure vessels are prohibited from departing the U.S. on temporary sojourn to Cuba effective tomorrow , ' the Commerce Department said in a statement to The Associated Press .\nThe new restrictions are part of a broader effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to roll back the Obama-era efforts to restore normal relations between the United States and Cuba , which drew sharp criticism from the more hardline elements of the Cuban-American community and their allies in Congress .\nU.S. national security adviser John Bolton , who declared Cuba part of a 'troika of tyranny ' along with Nicaragua and Venezuela as he outlined new sanctions in November , said the new policy is intended to deny the Cuban government a vital source of revenue .\n'The Administration has advanced the President 's Cuba policy by ending 'veiled tourism ' to Cuba and imposing restrictions on vessels , ' Bolton said on Twitter .\n'We will continue to take actions to restrict the Cuban regime 's access to U.S . dollars . '\nCruise lines carrying passengers booked before Tuesday had been hoping that they could request specific federal permits to complete their trips to Cuba , said Pedro Freyre , a Miami-based attorney who represents Carnival and three other major cruise lines .\n'For now , it 's prohibited unless the cruise lines requests a specific license , ' Freyre said . He said cruise lines had been trying to determine 'if there 's any opening there to at least complete trips that have been booked and passengers that have made travel plans . '\nNorwegian Cruise Line said in a statement that it was scrutinizing the new rules and consulting with lawyers and trade experts .\n'We are closely monitoring these recent developments and any resulting impact to cruise travel to Cuba , ' Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement . 'We will communicate to our guests and travel partners as additional information becomes available . '\nShore excursions from cruise ships tend to be organized by the cruise lines in cooperation with Cuban government tour agency Havanatur .\nA smaller number hire private tour guides or drivers of restored classic cars who wait outside Havana 's cruise docks .\n'This affects all of us , ' said William M\u00e1rtinez , 58 , a Cuban-born American who lived in Florida for 46 years but returned five years ago to drive a classic car for tourists . 'It 's inhuman , the sanctions that they 're putting on Cuba . '\nHardline move : John Bolton , Donald Trump 's national security adviser , unveiled the action against Cuba earlier this year , accusing it , Venezuela and Nicaragua of being a 'troika of tyranny '\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the measures are a response to what it calls Cuba 's 'destabilizing role ' in the Western Hemisphere , including support for the government of President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela .\n'This administration has made a strategic decision to reverse the loosening of sanctions and other restrictions on the Cuban regime , ' Mnuchin said . 'These actions will help to keep U.S. dollars out of the hands of Cuban military , intelligence , and security services . '\nCruise ships have brought thousands of Americans to Cuba since the U.S. began restoring full diplomatic relations with the communist government in December 2014 and have provided an important economic lifeline to the island .\nAlong with the cruise ships , the U.S. will also now ban most private planes and boats from stopping in the island .\n'Consequently , private and corporate aircraft , cruise ships , sailboats , fishing boats , and other similar aircraft and vessels generally will be prohibited from going to Cuba , ' according to the new rules published by the Commerce Department .\nThe new restrictions take effect Wednesday , but the government will allow anyone who has already paid for the trip to go ahead with it .\nCruises have become more popular than flights for leisure travelers to Cuba - nearly 30,000 more came by cruise ship than flights this year . The figures exclude Cuban-born Americans visiting family on the island .\nCommercial airline flights appear to be unaffected by the new measures and travel for university groups , academic research , journalism and professional meetings will continue to be allowed .\n'It kills the people-to-people category , which is the most common way for the average American to travel to Cuba , ' said Collin Laverty , head of Cuba Educational Travel , one of the largest Cuba travel companies in the U.S .\nThe new restrictions had been previewed by national security adviser John Bolton in an April speech in Miami to veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion but details of the changed were not made public until Tuesday .

The pair will be joined by other key Democrats in Congress , including those on committees overseeing infrastructure issues .\nThe Democrats made no mention of Trump \u2019 s demand on Tuesday that Congress first approve a new North American free trade deal before moving to infrastructure . Trump also suggested Congress use a surface transportation measure that expires in September 2020 as a vehicle for infrastructure spending .\nOn April 30 , Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to build roads , bridges , power grids , water and broadband infrastructure , but delayed the tough decisions on how to fund it to another meeting .\nAdministration officials and congressional aides are skeptical that 18 months before the election both sides will have the political will to find substantial new revenue .\nSenator Tom Carper , the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee , said in an interview on Tuesday that the United States has an $ 800 billion backlog of badly needed projects .\n\u201c We need for ( Trump ) to show some leadership , \u201d Carper said , saying Trump needs to explain how he will fund repairs . \u201c If he does ... he will not be by himself . \u201d\nFitch Ratings said last week that any U.S. plan for boosting infrastructure \u201c will need to provide for consistent , continued federal funding and more diverse funding sources to fully address the infrastructure deficit . \u201d\nFitch noted that as the federal government has failed to act , 31 states have raised gas taxes since 2013 , including four in 2019 . But Fitch said state and local governments are unable to raise adequate funds to fully address infrastructure needs on their own .\nRepublicans are not willing to roll back tax cuts from Trump \u2019 s 2017 tax reform legislation , an idea Democrats who largely opposed that measure have floated as a way of financing the infrastructure plans .\nU.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the Infrastructure Initiative at the Local 18 Richfield Training Site in Richfield , Ohio , U.S. , March 29 , 2018 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Yuri Gripas\nLast month , top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump has not decided whether he would support an increase in fuel taxes to fund infrastructure projects .\nOn Tuesday , Representative Earl Blumenauer , a Democrat , introduced legislation to hike the fuel tax by five cents a year over five years and index it to inflation to pay for repairs .", "The left generally supports the deal as a marginal improvement on NAFTA and a win for organized labor .\n\u201c While this measure has some things not to like , it has others that are worthy . The USMCA would do away with a back-channel dispute resolution mechanism that corporations have used to demand concessions from the member governments . And the pact includes significant provisions on e-commerce , which was in its infancy when NAFTA was passed , as well as protections for U.S. copyright holders . The simple truth is that NAFTA has been a success , so a modest update is not a bad thing . Critics point to job losses in manufacturing since it went into effect . But most of the losses were from technological change or trade with countries like China\u2026 While not perfect , and leaving out some crucial areas like climate change , the USMCA is worth passing . \u201d\n\u201c The most important improvement \u2014 the one for which workers \u2019 advocates fought for hardest \u2014 is the facility-specific labor enforcement measures , because without those , the improved labor standards mean nothing . For the first time in any trade agreement , tariffs and fines can be imposed against specific products produced in facilities that are determined to deny workers collective-bargaining rights . If there are repeated violations , goods can be blocked at the border\u2026\n\u201c The AFL-CIO has vehemently opposed almost every significant trade deal since NAFTA , but after playing an active role in the USMCA negotiations and forcing labor standards and enforcement improvements in Trump \u2019 s 2018 deal , they told their members , \u2018 We have secured an agreement that working people can proudly support . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Democrats seem to have secured other important concessions in the deal . The original USMCA was widely considered a giveaway to pharmaceutical companies because it guaranteed the makers of expensive biologic drugs 10 years of protection from cheaper competition . That provision , which could have made it harder for the U.S. to lower its own drug costs , is out . The new agreement also adds more enforcement on environmental rules . The deal isn \u2019 t perfect : Nancy Pelosi failed to remove protections for internet companies that could make it more difficult for the U.S. to amend its own laws\u2026\n\u201c But , at first glance , it looks like an improvement over both the original-recipe NAFTA and the first draft of the USMCA , and it could help set better standards for America \u2019 s future trade deals . \u201d\nCritics , however , contend that \u201c The United States International Trade Commission predicts the measures will succeed in the narrow purpose of shifting work to the United States , but only at a high cost : Consumers will pay more for new vehicles , resulting in fewer sales , and economic growth will suffer . There is a broader threat , too . Shifting work to Mexico has allowed American car companies to reduce costs , and to compete more effectively with foreign producers . Without NAFTA , there might be even fewer car-making jobs in the United States today . And as a result of the changes , there may be fewer in the future\u2026\n\u201c The best argument for passage is prophylactic . President Trump has threatened to abandon NAFTA in the absence of a new deal , and the changes are less important than the part that would stay the same : a free-trade area for most goods encompassing the three largest nations of North America . \u201d\n\u201c Just what would the USMCA do for the economy in 2020 ? Not much , it turns out\u2026 One of the two big economic projections on the deal , performed by the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , estimated it would add 176,000 jobs to the economy over the next six years . For context , that 's about as many jobs as we add in any single month of decent economic growth\u2026\n\u201c The USMCA will add 51,000 new jobs to manufacturing , mining , and farming over its first six years of operation . For context , those three industries employ something in the vicinity of 14 million people . That 's an increase of less than one percent \u2014 and not even in 2020 , but spread out over six years . Similarly , employment in the auto sector would increase by about three percent over the deal 's first six years . The idea that such minute changes will lead to meaningful differences that workers in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Indiana , Iowa , and Wisconsin would see and feel in their lives and communities before November 2020 seems like a stretch . \u201d\n\u201c By declaring that the United States will respond with airstrikes to any attacks on American targets or assets , Mr. Trump is drawing a bright red line that Iran can not cross . And yet , Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen , Syria , Iraq and Lebanon . Must they all respect Mr. Trump \u2019 s red line ? There are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination , the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are\u2026 Mr. Trump can \u2019 t keep an entire region from crossing his red line , making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it\u2026 \u200d \u201c It is crucial that influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham , Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell remind Mr. Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep Mr. Trump from stumbling further into war with Iran . \u201d", "The Trump administration has quietly altered its handling of visas granted to immigrants who cooperate with criminal investigations , allowing people to be deported even while they are waiting for their visas .\nThe change to U visas will make immigrants far less likely to report serious crimes , say immigration attorneys , who argue it also reflects the Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to deport as many immigrants as they can from the United States .\n\u201c This is going to have a chilling effect , \u201d Eileen Blessinger , a Falls Church , Va.-based immigration attorney , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , because \u201c by applying , you \u2019 re essentially reporting yourself to ICE but now there \u2019 s a risk that ICE might pick you up . \u201d\nThe change was announced in a revised Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) directive released on Aug. 2 .\nThe directive allows ICE to give permission for people to stay in the country as they await their U visas , which is a class of visa given to people who are cooperating with criminal investigations . But it also allows ICE to deport pending U visa applicants at their discretion .\nApplications for U visas can take up to four years . The government issues 10,000 per year but puts no limit on the number of visas that can be issued to spouses and children of applicants or to parents of applicants who are themselves under 21 .\nThe directive reserves the right for the agency to \u201c review the totality of the circumstances , including any favorable or adverse factors , and any federal interest ( s ) implicated and decide whether a Stay of Removal or terminating proceedings is appropriate . \u201d\nICE adds in the directive that it will \u201c exercise its discretion \u201d in determining whether to grant stay of removal requests , but cautions that the agency \u201c no longer exempts classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement . \u201d\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , an ICE spokesperson defended the change as necessary due to the volume of applications .\n\u201c As the number of U visa petitions submitted increased , this process became burdensome on both agencies and such determinations didn \u2019 t reflect a qualitative assessment of any assistance provided to law enforcement , '' the spokesperson said .\nBlessinger said the new directive piggybacks on another policy change that began about a year ago , when United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended its practice of waiving fees for U visa applicants . This change cut down the number of people who could even seek out U visas .\nWhile the application itself does not cost any money , applicants with past criminal or immigration violations must pay a $ 585 fee to apply for a waiver .\nBlessinger told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that her firm , Blessinger Legal , had a client who had been deported twice before whose daughter was a victim of child sexual abuse and who had cooperated with the investigation .\nThe man was able to file for a U visa , which was eventually approved , and will be able to stay in the United States and continue to cooperate with the sexual abuse investigation .\nIf he had applied for the U visa under the terms of the new ICE directive , however , he could have been deported .\nAnother of her clients , Blessinger said , is a Salvadoran immigrant and victim of domestic violence who came to the U.S. in 2004 and has been detained in Caroline Detention Facility in Fort A.P . Hill , Va. , after failing to appear in court in El Paso , Texas , after receiving a notice to appear that Blessinger said did not include her hearing \u2019 s date or time .\n\u201c She missed the court hearing and got a deportation order and the motion to reopen was denied , but while it was pending we were able to get U visa certification signed off saying she was a victim of domestic violence and cooperated with the investigation , \u201d Blessinger told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c She \u2019 s not a criminal , she \u2019 s someone that in the past would be released on an ankle bracelet , \u201d added Blessinger .\n\u201c The U visa was created in 2000 by a bipartisan majority in Congress with two important purposes : one , to be a tool for law enforcement to investigate or prosecute criminal activity , and the other is to provide protection for immigrant survivors in coming forward and seeking protection , \u201d Cecelia Friedman Levin , senior policy counsel at ASISTA Immigration Assistance , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c What we see here with new ICE policies that impact the U visa program is that some of these changes really contravene the purpose that Congress created these protections for , \u201d she added .\nComplicating the process further , Friedman Levin said , ICE has yet to publicly issue the full guidance for the new U visa policy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s leaving everyone in the dark in terms of what they \u2019 re actually supposed to do , \u201d she said , calling the change \u201c just another way of just continued and deliberate erosion of access to protection . \u201d\nKristian Ramos , communications director at the immigrant advocacy group Define American , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the change was indicative of the administration \u2019 s general handling of long-standing immigration policy .\n\u201c This administration \u2019 s reckless changing of long-standing laws has very human casualties , \u201d Ramos told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe client \u201c came forward under the auspices that the law would protect her from deportation and it \u2019 s incredibly unfair to literally just change the rules on someone who is just trying to get help , \u201d he added .", "A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration can make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for immigration court hearings while the policy is challenged in court , handing the president a major victory , even if it only proves temporary .\nThe 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 a frequent target of the president 's complaints \u2014 reversed a decision by a San Francisco judge that would have prevented asylum seekers from being returned to Mexico during the legal challenge .\nThe case must still be considered on its merits and could end up at the Supreme Court . But allowing the policy to remain in effect in the meantime lets the administration carry out an unprecedented change to U.S. asylum practices .\nThe administration has said it plans to rapidly expand the policy across the border , which would have far-reaching consequences for asylum seekers and Mexican border cities that host them while their cases wind through clogged U.S. immigration courts . Cases can take several years to decide .\nThe policy was challenged by 11 Central Americans and advocacy groups that argued it jeopardized asylum seekers by forcing them to stay in Mexico , where crime and drug violence are prevalent .\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg agreed April 8 and said the policy should be halted because it failed to evaluate the dangers migrants faced in Mexico .\nThe administration introduced its `` Migrant Protection Protocols '' policy on Jan. 29 in San Diego and later expanded it to Calexico , California , and El Paso , Texas . Under the policy , asylum seekers report to a border crossing in the morning . The U.S. government provides transportation to immigration court and returns them to the border after the hearing .\nThe U.S. has returned 3,267 Central American asylum seekers through three border cities , Mexico 's immigration agency said Monday .\nThe administration briefly halted the policy after Seeborg 's ruling but resumed on April 16 , sending 673 people to Tijuana from San Diego since then , 298 to Mexicali from Calexico and 967 to Ciudad Juarez from El Paso .\nThe policy was introduced to deal with a growing number of asylum-seeking families from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador arriving at the U.S. border with Mexico . Under a court order , children generally can not be detained more than 20 days , which has led to widespread releases of families almost immediately after they are stopped by authorities .\nThe January launch followed months of delicate talks between senior U.S. and Mexican officials that culminated in dual announcements after a meeting in November in Houston . Both sides characterized it as a unilateral move by the Trump administration and Mexican officials have made clear that they do not endorse the policy .\nThe three-judge appeals court panel cited Mexico 's position to reject the argument that asylum seekers were at risk .\nThe judges said the `` likelihood of harm is reduced somewhat by the Mexican government 's commitment to honor its international law obligations and to grant humanitarian status and work permits to individuals returned under the ( Migrant Protection Protocols ) . '' In fact , Mexico said Dec. 20 that it would allow foreigners to apply for a work permit , not necessarily get one .\nJudge Diarmuid O'Scannlain , who was appointed by President Ronald Regan , offered the strongest backing for the administration 's position . Judges William Fletcher , an appointee of Bill Clinton , and Paul Watford , who was named by Barack Obama , were more critical .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union , Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for Gender & Refugee Studies sued over the policy .\nOmar Jadwat , director of the ACLU 's Immigrants ' Rights Project , said remarks by two of the three judges give reason to believe that the policy will eventually be halted but also raised concern about the impact of Tuesday 's decision .\n`` Asylum seekers are being put at serious risk of harm every day that the forced return policy continues , '' he said .\nJustice and Homeland Security Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Tuesday , and neither did Mexico 's Foreign Relations Secretary officials .\nMexicans and children who travel alone are exempt from the policy .", "WASHINGTON \u2013 Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said President Trump is \u201c deadly serious \u201d about imposing tariffs on Mexico to push the country to stop the flow of migrants crossing the US southern border .\n\u201c He is absolutely , deadly serious , \u201d Mulvaney said on \u201c Fox News Sunday. \u201d \u201c I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10th . The president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border . \u201d\nTrump announced the tariffs via tweet on Thursday , saying they would gradually increase .\n\u201c On June 10th , the United States will impose a 5 % Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico , until such time as illegal migrants coming from Mexico , and into our country , STOP , \u201d Trump wrote . \u201c The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied at which time the Tariffs will be removed . \u201d\nThe White House later said that the tariffs would go to 10 percent on July 1 , 15 percent on August 1 , 20 percent on September 1 and 25 percent on October 1 .\n\u201c The purpose of this is not to create uncertainty . The purpose is to fix the situation on the southern border .

We need them to put their authorities down there and interdict these folks before they make this route all the way to the U.S . \u201d", "The Trump administration has reportedly found a way to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico during the months , or longer , that it takes to apply for protection in the US , making the tens of thousands of Central Americans and others who flee northward to the US each year essentially Mexico \u2019 s problem to solve .\nOn Saturday , Nick Miroff and Joshua Partlow of the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration had made a deal with the incoming president of Mexico , Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , to implement a \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy .\nThe incoming Mexican administration released a statement Saturday night that looked like a denial of the Washington Post story \u2014 but didn \u2019 t actually contradict that a deal was being discussed , or even that they \u2019 re close to finalizing one .\nContemplated since the earliest days of the Trump administration ( one of the first executive orders the president signed instructed the Department of Homeland Security to look into the prospect ) , the policy would bar asylum seekers from entering the US until their applications were approved , or until they got deported , unless they had a \u201c reasonable fear \u201d of staying in Mexico .\nWhile the two countries are still hammering out the details , it appears that the biggest question \u2014 whether Mexico would cooperate \u2014 has now been settled .\nThe appeal to the Trump administration is clear . The administration is desperate to reduce the number of people entering the US without papers to the anomalously low levels of Donald Trump \u2019 s first few months in office \u2014 even if it means asylum seekers face a bevy of human rights concerns while they remain in Mexico , from criminal victimization to concerns about food and shelter .\nThe US could start implementing the new policy in the coming days or weeks , likely starting at ports of entry ( official border crossings ) in San Diego , where thousands of asylum seekers have been waiting on the other side .\nThere \u2019 s a lot we still don \u2019 t know about how this is going to work , either because it hasn \u2019 t actually been worked out yet or because details aren \u2019 t yet public . As it stands , this could be a temporary inconvenience \u2014 or lead to the US essentially creating refugee camps just across the border . Here \u2019 s what we do and don \u2019 t know .\nWhat we know about the US-Mexico asylum deal and the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy\nThe Washington Post reported that the Trump administration has negotiated a tentative deal with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , or AMLO , the incoming president of Mexico , who takes office December 1 . The Washington Post confirmed the tentative deal in an interview with Olga Sanchez Cordero , AMLO \u2019 s incoming interior minister .\nLopez Obrador \u2019 s administration-in-waiting responded to the Post story with a non-denial denial . On Saturday night , a lot of press outlets reported that the Mexicans had denied there was a deal . But the actual statement , issued by Sanchez Cordero \u2019 s office , didn \u2019 t actually deny that the incoming administration is working on a deal with the Trump administration , or even that they have agreed in principle to allow asylum seekers to stay in Mexico and are just working out the details .\nThe statement said that \u201c there is no agreement of any sort between the government-elect of Mexico and the government of the United States , as the next president , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , will take office on December 1. \u201d In other words , they deny that the incoming government was already making official deals behind the outgoing government \u2019 s back .\nAnd it said that the incoming Mexican government isn \u2019 t considering becoming a \u201c safe third country \u201d for asylum seekers trying to enter the US \u2014 referring to a specific kind of diplomatic agreement that is different from the plan the Post reported on .\nUnder the deal , asylum seekers would have to demonstrate a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico to be allowed to stay in the United States . The initial screening interview for asylum seekers requires them to show a credible fear of persecution if they \u2019 re deported to their home countries . If they meet that standard , they \u2019 re allowed to stay in the US while their full application for asylum is pending ; if they don \u2019 t ( and they don \u2019 t appeal the decision ) , they \u2019 re deported .\nUnder the agreement , as the Post describes it , asylum seekers who meet the credible fear standard would also be asked about the prospects of staying in Mexico . If they couldn \u2019 t show a reasonable fear ( a higher standard than credible fear ) of staying in Mexico , they \u2019 d still be allowed to apply for asylum in the US , but they \u2019 d wait in Mexico until their case was completed .\nAs a result , in theory , the majority of Central Americans and other asylum seekers who travel through Mexico would be required to stay in Mexico while their asylum cases were pending in the United States . Right now , it can take months , or years , for an asylum seeker who \u2019 s not detained in a US immigration detention center to have her asylum case evaluated . It \u2019 s not clear whether asylum seekers waiting in Mexico would be processed on an expedited schedule , and , if so , whether that wouldn \u2019 t further delay processing for people waiting for asylum in the US .\nKey details of the plan are still being worked out . According to the Post article , \u201c Senior U.S. officials said they want more assurances on how Mexico intends to keep asylum seekers safe and to ensure they don \u2019 t get deported back to Central America before their asylum claims get resolved. \u201d Those are substantial questions , not least because the US is obligated under international law not to send an asylum seeker back to persecution \u2014 even if it is not the country doing the deporting .\nAsylum officers are already being sent to San Diego to prepare for implementing the policy . An email from a senior official at US Citizenship and Immigration Services , sent out late Wednesday , asked for volunteers who might be sent to San Diego \u201c as early as Friday , \u201d though details were scarce . The Post believes the officers are being sent to implement the new policy , as the US will need a lot of asylum officers at ports of entry to conduct the interviews that will ensure they \u2019 re not sending anyone back to danger in Mexico .\nWhat we don \u2019 t know about the US-Mexico asylum deal and the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy\nWhen the US will start implementing a \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy . L\u00f3pez Obrador takes office on December 1 , so it \u2019 s probable that the US-Mexico agreement will be signed no sooner than that . ( And it could take several more days or even weeks to work out remaining details . )\nBut it \u2019 s not totally clear that the US is going to wait to have a formal agreement . On Wednesday , the Post reported that Trump senior policy adviser and immigration guru Stephen Miller wanted to start implementing a \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy immediately \u2014 even while negotiations with Mexico were ongoing . The Saturday report from the Post doesn \u2019 t clarify whether this possibility is still on the table .\nWhat legal authority the US will use to implement \u201c Remain in Mexico. \u201d There is a provision in US law that allows the US to force applicants for admission to remain in a \u201c contiguous country \u201d while their claims are being processed . But it \u2019 s not clear whether they \u2019 re using this provision for the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d plan . Because that \u2019 s ambiguous , there are lots of other unresolved questions , including ...\nWhether the policy will apply to people apprehended by Border Patrol after crossing into the US , or whether it will only apply for people presenting themselves legally at official ports of entry to seek asylum . The \u201c contiguous countries \u201d provision applies to both cases . But the Post \u2019 s reporting implies that \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d will only apply at ports .\nOn the one hand , pushing people back to Mexico after they \u2019 ve crossed into the US could run afoul of the statutory US right to seek asylum . On the other hand , allowing people who cross into the US illegally to stay , while barring those who enter legally by presenting themselves at a port of entry , would make it even harder for the Trump administration to argue they \u2019 re trying to encourage asylum seekers to come legally . ( That \u2019 s the argument the White House is currently using to defend the asylum ban in federal court . )\nWhether the US will need to do anything beyond signing an agreement with Mexico to ratify the policy . In theory , if the policy requires the US to do things differently than the current regulations regarding asylum specify , they \u2019 ll have to rewrite those regulations . ( That \u2019 s something the executive branch can do without Congress , as long as it follows proper procedures and doesn \u2019 t contradict the law . )\nThey could propose a regulation that would take effect immediately , as they did with the asylum ban . Such a change would probably be challenged in court ( as the asylum ban was ) but might be on firmer legal ground than the asylum ban .\nHow people will be taken care of while waiting in Mexico . Migrant shelters along the border are already overcrowded , and Tijuana is currently struggling to house 5,000 asylum seekers . Thousands of them have arrived in the past week as part of the fall \u201c caravan , \u201d but others have been waiting for weeks or months to be admitted at the port of entry .\nThe Post says the US doesn \u2019 t appear to be offering any financial support to Mexico to feed , shelter , and care for asylum seekers while they wait . Some business owners in Tijuana have reportedly offered to give jobs to asylum seekers , but it \u2019 s not clear how they \u2019 d be able to work legally in Mexico without seeking legal status there \u2014 and getting legal status in Mexico could make it much harder for them to get asylum in the US .\nHow this will be challenged in court and if it will ultimately be found legal . It is inevitable that advocates will sue to block the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy . But because so many things about it are still unclear , it \u2019 s not apparent what exactly their basis for a lawsuit will be . The \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy is another legally aggressive step on asylum , an area of law where Congress has pretty clearly spelled out what \u2019 s supposed to happen . On the other hand , the judicial branch tends to extend the executive branch a lot of deference when foreign policy is involved .\nUltimately , the prospects of the Remain in Mexico policy might not be apparent until the policy has already been put in place \u2014 and in the meantime , asylum seekers will be the subjects of a binational experiment .", "The US and Canada struck a last-minute NAFTA deal Sunday night .\nHours before the midnight deadline , the two countries agreed to a framework for a renewed trilateral agreement between the United States , Mexico , and Canada . Newly dubbed the \u201c USMCA \u201d \u2014 the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 it \u2019 s basically an updated version of the original North American Free Trade Agreement between the three countries .\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland \u2014 the two top negotiators on USMCA \u2014 said in a joint statement late Sunday night that , together with Mexico , they had reached a \u201c new , modernized trade agreement . \u201d\n\u201c USMCA will give our workers , farmers , ranchers , and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets , fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region , \u201d the statement read . \u201c It will strengthen the middle class , and create good , well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home . \u201d\nThe breakthrough marked a reversal of a weeks-long impasse and a flurry of tough rhetoric , especially on the part of President Donald Trump and his administration . Both Trump and Lighthizer made it known last week that the US was prepared to move ahead with a bilateral deal between the US and Mexico , leaving Canada out .\nBut on Friday , the US and Mexico agreed to hold off publishing the bilateral text , in the hopes of using the weekend to hammer out an agreement between the US and Canada to update the decades-old NAFTA .\nAnd now a deal has been reached , and both sides notched victories . Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it a \u201c good day for Canada . \u201d\nTrump , tweeting Monday morning , congratulated Canada and Mexico and called it a \u201c great deal for all three countries . \u201d\nLate last night , our deadline , we reached a wonderful new Trade Deal with Canada , to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico . The new name will be The United States Mexico Canada Agreement , or USMCA . It is a great deal for all three countries , solves the many ...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 1 , 2018\n.... deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA , greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers , reduces Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations together in competition with the rest of the world . The USMCA is a historic transaction ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 1 , 2018\nSenior Trump administration officials are calling this a big win for the US , Canada , and Mexico and say the deal \u201c represents fulfillment of one of the president \u2019 s most important campaign promises . \u201d\nA peek at what the US and Canada agreed to during negotiations\nA few notable issues stalled the negotiations between Canada and the US over the past month \u2014 and at the outset , these appear to have been mostly resolved , giving each side a chance to declare victory .\nThe US wanted greater access to Canada \u2019 s dairy market , and according to senior Trump administration officials , they won \u201c a good deal for American farmers \u201d on that front . The deal also calls for the elimination of Class 7 milk pricing , a new class of dairy Canada created that US dairy farmers said decreased their ability to export to Canada .\nCanada wanted to preserve NAFTA \u2019 s Chapter 19 , an independent panel set up to resolve special trade disputes . Though it \u2019 s renumbered in the final USMCA agreement , the provision stays mostly intact .\nOttawa also wanted some protections from Section 232 tariffs \u2014 the mechanism the Trump administration used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on countries , including Canada , which requires a national security justification . Senior Trump administration officials said accommodations would be made to protect Canada from tariffs on automobiles . Canada did not get guarantees over those over steel and aluminum tariffs , and they \u2019 ll be dealt with separately .\nThese , of course , are not the only components of the deal , and this new agreement incorporates the components of the bilateral agreement between the US and Mexico , including rules of origin for automobiles ( meaning a certain percentage of parts have to be manufactured in each country to avoid tariffs ) as well as new digital trade rules , intellectual property protections , and strengthened labor rules .", "A defiant Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urged Greeks on Wednesday to reject an international bailout deal , wrecking any prospect of repairing broken relations with EU partners before a referendum on Sunday that may decide Greece 's future in Europe .\nLess than 24 hours after he wrote a conciliatory letter to creditors asking for a new bailout that would accept many of their terms , Tsipras abruptly switched back into combative mode in a television address .\nGreece was being `` blackmailed , '' he said , quashing talk that he might delay the vote , call it off or urge Greeks to vote yes .\nThe remarks added to the frantic and at times surreal atmosphere of recent days in which acrimonious messages from the leftist government have alternated with late-night offers of concessions to restart negotiations .\nA day after Greece became the first advanced economy to default on debt to the IMF , long lines at cash machines provided a stark visual symbol of the pressure on Tsipras , who came to power in January vowing to end austerity and protect the poor .\n`` A 'No ' vote is a decisive step toward a better agreement that we aim to sign right after Sunday 's result , '' he said , rejecting repeated warnings from European partners that the referendum would effectively be a vote on whether Greece stays in the euro or returns to the drachma .\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk retorted in a tweet : `` Europe wants to help Greece . But can not help anyone against their own will . Let 's wait for the results of the Greek referendum . ''\nEuro zone finance ministers held an hour-long conference call to discuss the previous night 's offer from Tsipras , but were adamant that no further discussions would be held until after the Sunday vote . The head of the currency zone ministers ' Eurogroup , Jeroen Dijsselbloem , said he saw `` little chance '' of progress after Tsipras ' latest comments .\nGlobal financial markets have reacted remarkably calmly to the widely anticipated Greek default , strengthening the hand of hardline euro zone partners who say Athens can not use the threat of contagion to weaker European sovereigns as a bargaining chip .\nIn his overnight letter to creditors , seen by Reuters , Tsipras agreed to accept most of their demands for taxes and pension cuts and asked for a new 29 billion euro ( $ 32.21 billion ) loan to cover all debt service payments in the next two years .\nHowever even if negotiations do restart after the referendum , Germany and others made clear that any talks on a new program would have to start from scratch with different conditions .\nThe exasperated tone to public comments of European leaders exhausted by the chaotic turnarounds of the past few days offered little hope of a breakthrough .\nTsipras has suggested he would step aside if Greeks vote yes in Sunday 's referendum , and many other euro zone countries have made little secret that they see no point in negotiating with him before then .\n`` This government has done nothing since it came into office , '' German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in a speech in the lower house of parliament in which he accused Athens of repeatedly reneging on its commitments .\n`` You ca n't in all honesty expect us to talk with them in a situation like this , '' he said .\nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin , among Greece 's strongest sympathizers in the euro zone , told RTL radio : `` The aim is to find an agreement before the referendum if possible ...

Even with a withdrawal limit of only 60 euros a day , there were signs of banknote shortages , with bankers saying 50-euro and 20-euro notes were running low .\nKiki Rizopoulou , a 79 year-old pensioner from Lamia in central Greece had to travel to Athens to collect her pension , spending 20 euros of the 120 euros she was allowed to take out .\n`` I already have to pay back 50 euros that I owe . It 's embarrassing , '' she said .\nAn opinion poll showed opposition to the bailout in the lead but also that the gap had narrowed significantly as the bank closure and capital controls began to bite . But the hardship facing pensioners added to the pressure facing Tsipras , who has indicated he will resign if he loses the referendum .\nEurope 's top human rights watchdog criticized the haste with which the vote had been arranged but posters from the ruling Syriza party calling for a `` No '' vote started to appear in central Athens . The center-right opposition also ran television spots mocking previous comments from the government that capital controls would never be imposed .\nThe Tsipras letter contained only a single sketchy reference to labor market reform , which was one of the creditors ' key demands to make the Greek economy more competitive , and no mention at all of frozen privatizations , another bugbear .\n`` The new framework will be legislated in autumn 2015 , '' it said without saying what measures it contained . Tsipras ' leftist government wants to restore collective bargaining rights scrapped under previous bailout-driven reforms , and opposes a demand to make collective layoffs easier in the private sector .\nTsipras did agree to implement immediately a range of measures recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to make it easier to do business and open up closed business sectors .\nIn the letter , he asked to keep a discount on value added tax for Greek islands , stretch out defense spending cuts and delay the phasing out of an income supplement to poorer pensioners .\nEuropean financial markets remained strikingly calm in the light of the upcoming referendum , the IMF default and heightened concerns about the risk of Athens sliding out the euro .\nThe lack of panic or contagion to other euro markets stood in marked contrast to 2011 , when the Greek crisis was perceived as a threat to the future of the single currency .\nAnd this lack of overspill has emboldened the more hawkish of Greece 's sovereign creditors , including those in Berlin , who insist Greece had been effectively ringfenced by a host of financial buffers and its fate would not undermine the integrity of the euro in the same way it did four years ago .\nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin , who has been Greece 's strongest sympathizer in the euro zone , told RTL radio : `` The aim is to find an agreement before the referendum if possible ...

Walmart also saw increased demand for adult-sized bikes .\nBJ \u2019 s CEO Lee Delaney told investors on Thursday that the company saw \u201c relatively significant growth \u201d in discretionary categories , including electronics and TVs .\n\u201c We would imagine that there is certainly an impact from stimulus checks that are impacting the business , \u201d Delaney said . \u201c But I think it \u2019 s right to assume there is some benefit flowing through from stimulus checks in the business . \u201d\n( BJ \u2019 s did not respond to a request for a further comment . )\nAt Best Buy , customers used their stimulus checks to buy computing and gaming equipment , Corie Barry , the company \u2019 s CEO , said on it Thursday earnings call .\n\u201c Like many other retailers , we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide , \u201d Barry said .\n( Best Buy did not respond to a request for a further comment . )\nThe different phases of the pandemic have shaped shoppers \u2019 choices . As stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country , \u201c parents became teachers , \u201d McMillon said on Walmart \u2019 s earnings call . \u201c Adult bicycles started selling out , as parents started to join the kids . An overlapping trend then started emerging related to DIY and home-related activities . \u201d\nConsumers also bought sewing machines and bandanas to make their own face masks , he said .\nSales took off in mid-April when many Americans began to receive their $ 1,200 stimulus checks . Within 10 days of receiving their stimulus checks , households spent around one quarter to one third of it , research shows .\nSee also : Walmart spent nearly $ 900 million on the coronavirus in Q1 and says it \u2019 s a \u2018 reasonable assumption \u2019 that they \u2019 ll spend that much in Q2\nBefore the checks were issued on April 15 , there was \u201c not as much demand \u201d for discretionary goods at Walmart , said spokesman Randy Hargrove , adding that sales increased \u201c towards the end of the quarter . \u201d\nTarget Corp. also experienced \u201c a rapid increase in traffic and sales \u201d for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks , CEO Brian Cornell said on the company \u2019 s Wednesday earnings call . \u201c We certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15 , as those checks arrived across America , \u201d Cornell said on the company \u2019 s call .\n\u201c Before the checks were issued on April 15 , there was \u2018 not as much demand \u2019 for discretionary goods at Walmart , said spokesman Randy Hargrove \u201d\nCustomers , he said , are \u201c still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check. \u201d People are shopping across all categories including apparel , which has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn .\n( Costco COST , +0.99 % declined to comment on whether it has experienced the same trend in sales related to stimulus payments . )\niPhone maker Apple also saw sales increase after stimulus payments went out , Cook said on the company \u2019 s April 30 earnings call . \u201c A part of it is due to just our new products , \u201d Cook said . But another part of it is also \u201c due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April. \u201d ( Apple did not respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s request for a further comment . )\nUnlike Target and Walmart , which have remained open during the coronavirus outbreak and can sell apparel in-stores , \u201c non-esential \u201d clothing retailers including Gap GAP , +8.84 % , Nordstrom NRD , +2.77 % and Nike NKE , +3.49 % have been forced to close many stores across the country . As a result , retailers in the apparel industry have offered consumers online deals comparable to Cyber Monday .\nStill , many Americans have used their stimulus checks to stock up on essentials . That \u2019 s especially true for those who received their checks in the first wave of stimulus payments , said Stuart Sopp , CEO and founder of Current , a New York City-based mobile-banking startup .\nIn mid-April when payments were initially distributed , \u201c most people immediately spent on groceries , \u201d said Sopp . Many Current members , he said , also took cash out of ATMs to \u201c pay friends back and pay their bills. \u201d He added , \u201c People were struggling for basic life essentials and the stimulus payments really helped them , which I think is what it was all about . \u201d\nIn the next wave of payments , which occurred towards the end of April , more people used the funds \u201c for everyday means , \u201d Sopp said . That included ordering more food delivery and takeout , and gas .\nThe $ 3 trillion coronavirus aid package the House of Representatives passed last week , dubbed the HEROS Act , calls for a second round of stimulus checks . President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they are in no rush to sign the relief package to law . Trump has shown support for a second round of stimulus checks .\nIf people do end up receiving a second stimulus check , Sopp predicts most will use the money for the same purposes .\nBest Buy \u2019 s Barry said Thursday that \u201c the impact of current to potential future government stimulus actions \u201d is something the company will keep an eye on \u201c for the remainder of the year . \u201d", "Tony ( last name not included for fear of reprisal on the job ) has worked at Bank of America for 11 years as a customer service associate . He takes phone calls from customers whose needs range from a simple change of address to a family crisis that leaves the caller unable to pay their bills , and he tries to help them solve their problems . And Tony and his coworkers are organizing .\nBank of America has had more complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau than any other American financial institution , according to a July report from Mother Jones magazine . And according to Tony , many of those complaints could be fixed with better training for workers , who instead feel squeezed , wanting to provide good service to the customers they talk to daily and on the other hand scapegoated when something goes wrong . Tired of the inadequate training they receive , tired of watching associates get fired for mistakes they did n't know were mistakes , tired of feeling like they 're hurting customers rather than helping them , a group of around 40 workers got together to try to make , in Tony 's words , a positive change .\n\u201c We started the group because we were tired of seeing good people walked out , \u201d Tony says . \u201c It 's tough when you 've got to work in an environment where they tap you on the shoulder , say 'Can you come to a meeting ? ' and as you walk away , another manager walks up to your desk with a box and starts packing your stuff . If you look over your shoulder , you see them packing your stuff as you walk away . And we all sit there in shock saying 'What did they do ? ' \u201d\nHe continues , \u201c When we 're not trained properly it 's hurting the customer , it 's hurting us . What 's sad is that , when we 're not trained properly our mistakes tend to favor the bank , when we 're trained properly we do n't favor the bank . Some people feel that the bank would rather us not be trained because the money they make off of that is in their favor . \u201d\nFor example , he says , associates received just a brief training on doing balance transfers in the computer system that they use to manage customers ' accounts . For a while , he was n't aware that at the end of the call , a disclosure statement would pop up that was to be read to the customer , a legal statement of how the interest would accrue and what the fee would be for the transfer . Instead , he says , they were told that they should never end a call until the customer is finished , so if the customer ended the call , the next call would come in without the disclosure ever appearing . One of his coworkers , he says , was fired when the quality control department , which listens to two recorded calls from each worker each month to make sure they 're doing their jobs correctly , caught her not reading the disclosure . \u201c This disclosure where the customer can say ' I do n't want a 4 % fee , ' this favors the bank when we do n't read it to them , \u201d he says . \u201c You 've already got the balance transfer , we ca n't do anything about the fee . \u201d\nAnother person , he says , was fired for taking a hold off of a deposited check at the request of a manager . The managers , he notes , get the same training on the system as the associates , but often have even less time to pay attention to them .\nTony worries that the computer-based trainings they do receive are inadequate . Instead of a class where they might be able to ask questions , he says , they get computer-based trainings that they are often pushed to rush through in less time than the training says it will take . Additionally , he says , \u201c The first thing it does is tell you 'here 's what the training is about , acknowledge you 've taken it and you know the subject matter . ' To get into the course to learn about the subject matter you have to click a button that says we know about the subject matter . After you take the course , if you do n't understand it , they go 'Well you learned about it , you clicked that button . ' There 's no way to take the course unless you acknowledge it . We feel that 's their way of saying it 's on you now . It 's not the bank , you acknowledged you know it , so you do it wrong , that 's your fault . \u201d\nThe training they do get , he says , is often about how to \u201c deepen the relationship , \u201d with the customer . \u201c Deepening the relationship is a nice word for selling you something , \u201d he says . Instead of upgrading a customer 's credit card , for instance , they are pushed to open a new card , one which might have a higher interest rate than their existing card . According to Chi Chi Wu , a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center , this process could violate the Truth in Lending Act , which prohibits \u201c unsolicited issuance \u201d of a credit card .\n\u201c Deepening the relationship \u201d means something different , perhaps , to Tony than it does to the bank higher-ups . He says , \u201c I once sat in a training was about selling more credit cards , how to 'deepen that relationship , ' using what the customer says as a tool to sell them this new credit card . One of the associates in the meeting says , 'This woman 's overdrawn , she 's told me she 's unemployed , I ca n't sell her a credit card , she ca n't afford to pay any of her bills now , that 's going to hurt her . ' The manager said 'How do you know she does n't need the credit card to buy milk or formula ? This could be just right at the right time . Sell her the credit card , it is n't our responsibility if she ca n't pay it . ' \u201d\n\u201c That 's the kind of thinking that sunk this economy , \u201d Tony adds .\nWith the help of the Committee for Better Banks , a labor-community coalition that includes Alliance for a Greater New York ( ALIGN ) , Make the Road New York , New York Communities for Change ( NYCC ) and the Communications Workers of America union ( CWA ) , Tony 's group started a petition on Coworker.org this June . The petition calls for \u201c independent , federally-guided training be implemented immediately , for employees and managers alike . \u201d\nTony and his coworkers are not the first Bank of America employees to worry that they are being pushed to do wrong by their customers . As David Dayen reported for \u2588\u2588\u2588 in June of 2013 , former employees testified that they were denied training on mortgage procedures under federal programs , given bonuses for putting accounts into foreclosure , and pressed to lie to customers . Tony says , \u201c Maybe they 're like us , maybe certain things were left out because it favored the bank . As long as managers and site leaders are making their quotas , making their numbers , maybe that 's all they care about . \u201d\n\u201c I look at Bank of America and like I said I 've worked there for years , I see them , they 're selling things off left and right , they 're selling branches in Michigan , they 're selling branches in Maine , we 're shrinking the bank , \u201d Tony continues . \u201c I wonder if they 're shrinking the bank to pay the bills and to make the bank look good ? Because it 's all about profit and money and we have to return to the shareholders . Do I think shareholders really care if the customers get burnt ? No , I really do n't . They 're more concerned with the return on their stock . Maybe if banks listened to their employees and listened to their customers , it would be much better world . \u201d\nThey began organizing with the idea of getting better at their jobs , being better able to serve their customers , and Tony says that though it 's slow , they are seeing some results . No one has acknowledged their petition , though he says he 's overhead remarks from higher-ups about their organizing , but after the workers took their yearly \u201c associate engagement survey , \u201d the Human Resources department sent someone to look into their complaints and one site leader was removed . This survey was given after about forty people had been let go for things that Tony says they 'd never have done if they were trained properly .\nOnce the workers began standing together to try to solve their problems , Tony says , there have been fewer firings and somewhat better communication , though information about practices still too often comes from other associates who have been reprimanded for doing something wrong and who share that information .\nTony hopes that if workers and customers stand up for each other , they can change the banking industry. \u201c Our customers are all our families , our friends , our communities , this country is in a dire situation because so many systems , of which banking is one , are failing them , because banking has become more about greed , \u201d he says . \u201c This is all of us together trying to make a better situation and until we all come together this is n't going to change . \u201d", "The storm clouds of the next global financial crisis are gathering despite the world financial system being unprepared for another downturn , the deputy head of the International Monetary Fund has warned .\nDavid Lipton , the first deputy managing director of the IMF , said that \u201c crisis prevention is incomplete \u201d more than a decade on from the last meltdown in the global banking system .\n\u201c As we have put it , \u2018 fix the roof while the sun shines \u2019 . But , like many of you , I see storm clouds building and fear the work on crisis prevention is incomplete . \u201d\nLipton said individual nation states alone would lack the firepower to combat the next recession , while calling on governments to work together to tackle the issues that could spark another crash .\n\u201c We ought to be concerned about the potency of monetary policy , \u201d he said of the ability of the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to cut interest rates to boost the economy in the event of another downturn , while also warning that high levels of borrowing by governments constrained their scope for cutting taxes and raising spending .\nLipton said the IMF went into the last crash under-resourced before it was handed a war chest worth $ 1tn ( \u00a3790bn ) from governments around the world , while adding that it was important that national leaders had agreed to complete a review of the fund \u2019 s financial firepower next year .\n\u201c One lesson from that crisis was the IMF went into it under-resourced ; we should try to avoid that next time . \u201d\nSpeaking to an audience at Bloomberg in London , Christine Lagarde \u2019 s deputy called on China to take urgent steps to open up its economy to global competition .\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @ BusinessDesk\nAgainst a backdrop of Donald Trump engaging in a bitter trade dispute with Beijing , he said China needed to lower trade barriers , while also impose tougher rules to protect intellectual property \u2013 a key complaint of the US president .\nLipton suggested that Chinese trade policies that were once considered acceptable when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a $ 1tn economy may now be inappropriate as it had become a $ 16tn international superpower .\nHowever , he did warn that the US should not take an overly heavy-handed approach to reform , adding : \u201c China has many reforms that it could carry out that would be in its own interest and in the interest of countries around the globe . But China feels they can \u2019 t take those steps , as they put it , with a gun to their head , in the midst of trade tensions . \u201d\nThe warning from the IMF marked the latest intervention from the Washington-based fund as the outlook for the global economy deteriorates , with particular flashpoints being the US-China trade dispute and central banks raising interest rates .\nGlobal growth is forecast to slow as a result of the trade war , while financial markets have also been rattled in recent weeks . Last week , the FTSE 100 recorded its worst day since the Brexit vote , prompted by fears over the dispute , wiping more than \u00a356bn off the value of the UK \u2019 s leading companies .\nAfter almost a decade of low interest rates , the total value of global debt , both public and private , has risen by 60 % to hit a record high of $ 182tn , so if central banks raise borrowing costs that would create difficulties for businesses and governments .\nLipton warned that sustained trade conflict between the US and China would be likely to trigger \u201c far-reaching and long-lasting consequences \u201d for the global economy , with a risk that Trump \u2019 s rhetoric could encourage China to shift its economy away from the rest of the world .\n\u201c Trade barriers if they are sustained could lead to a fragmentation of the global economy . \u201d\n\u201c If this [ trade dispute ] leads to stalemate , China may decide to reorientate its economy not to trade with the US . To accept sustained trade barriers \u2026 could lead to a slowdown [ for the global economy ] , \u201d he said .", "NEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - Wall Street sold off sharply on Wednesday as recession fears gripped the market after the U.S. Treasury yield curve temporarily inverted for the first time in 12 years .\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed down about 3 % , with the blue-chip Dow posting its biggest one-day point drop since October after 2-year Treasury yields surpassed those of 10-year bonds , which is considered a classic recession signal .\nDire economic data from China and Germany suggested a faltering global economy , stricken by the increasingly belligerent U.S.-China trade war , Brexit woes and geopolitical tensions .\nGermany reported a contraction in second-quarter gross domestic product , and China \u2019 s industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low .\n\u201c It was all negative and not much positive today , \u201d said Chuck Carlson , chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond , Indiana . \u201c We \u2019 re outside of the earnings season and markets are being batted around by news . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s a reactionary market right now and probably will continue to be , \u201d Carlson added . \u201c My guess is we \u2019 re probably in for this until after Labor Day . \u201d\nWednesday was the first time that yields for 2-year and 10-year Treasuries had inverted since June 2007 , months before the onset of the great recession , which crippled markets for years .\nThe U.S. yield curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years .\n\u201c It could be different this time , \u201d Carlson said . \u201c When you \u2019 ve got $ 15 trillion in global government debt at negative yields , that \u2019 s a new animal .\n\u201c Even if it is accurate in foreshadowing a recession , that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s coming tomorrow , \u201d he added .\nA trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) in New York , U.S. , August 14 , 2019 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Eduardo Munoz\nThe CBOE volatility index , a gauge of investor anxiety , jumped 4.58 points to 22.10 .\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800.49 points , or 3.05 % , to 25,479.42 , the S & P 500 lost 85.72 points , or 2.93 % , to 2,840.6 , and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 242.42 points , or 3.02 % , to 7,773.94 .\nOver 300 of the S & P 500 \u2019 s components are down 10 % or more from their 52-week highs , according to Refinitiv data .

''\nBut such visits -- or the lack thereof -- have historically been one of the diplomatic weapons U.S. administrations have deployed to sway the Israeli public .\nLess than a month before the 1996 Israeli elections , President Bill Clinton organized the signing of an anti-terror pact before the cameras with Shimon Peres , the Labor Party prime minister whom Netanyahu ended up defeating for his first term in office . In 1999 , Clinton similarly pursued what some call `` snub diplomacy '' when his administration denied Netanyahu meetings amidst a tight race with Labor 's Ehud Barak , to whom Netanyahu ultimately lost .\nThe state of the `` special relationship '' with the United States is of crucial importance to Israeli voters , who see America as their closest and most important ally . So in risking a rupture with the White House , Netanyahu is also risking a break with Israeli voters .\n`` Traditionally , the Israeli public has been very sensitive to how the relationship is going and how well the Israeli leadership is managing that relationship , '' said Daniel Kurtzer , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel .\nJUST WATCHED Netanyahu rails against Iran nuclear deal - in 100 seconds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Netanyahu rails against Iran nuclear deal - in 100 seconds 01:26\nBut Netanyahu 's move to address Congress on Iran , a top concern for the Israeli public , was also seen as a bid to boost his electoral appeal by reinforcing that he is a leader on the world stage and will do everything he can to protect Israel . When Republican House Speaker John Boehner extended the invitation to Netanyahu , many jumped on the House leader for helping the prime minister politically . This week , footage of Netanyahu being warmly received on Capitol Hill made it into a campaign ad .\nThe partisan nature of the invitation and that it was done without White House coordination -- Boehner is a chief Obama rival and disagrees emphatically with his Iran policy -- heightened Democratic pique over Netanyahu 's appearance .\nPrevious presidents have bristled at the hawkish , unflinching posture -- especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- that Netanyahu and other Likud party leaders have often struck . But the current antagonism , exacerbated by the speech , has become particularly personal .\nObama himself dismissed Netanyahu 's speech as `` theater '' and slammed his Israeli counterpart for offering `` nothing new . '' And a host of officials offered further criticism , including National Security Adviser Susan Rice , who called Netanyahu 's address `` destructive '' to the U.S-Israeli relationship .\nNetanyahu 's allies deny a political motive to the speech and have maintained that the hit to U.S.-Israeli ties was necessary because of the existential danger posed by Iran and fears that negotiations on its nuclear program would lead to a disastrous agreement as they reach a key deadline .\nFormer State Department official Aaron David Miller said the Obama administration is now sending `` certain unmistakable signals '' that Netanyahu is n't the right prime minister to manage the U.S.-Israel relationship .\nMiller witnessed the sending of similar signals in 1996 as one of the top officials coordinating Arab-Israeli negotiations in the Clinton administration .\n`` We clearly had our favorites and we wanted Peres to win , '' Miller recounted .\nIt has n't just been Netanyahu whom U.S. presidents have opposed . In the run-up to the 1992 Israeli elections that eventually saw Labor 's Yitzhak Rabin elected , George H.W . Bush tied up American loan guarantees to punish the right-wing Israeli government and pressure it to change its policy on settlements .\n`` [ The idea ] that we do n't intercede in Israeli politics is as foolish an assumption as that they do n't interfere in ours , '' Miller said .\nOne of many developments seen as souring the Obama-Netanyahu relationship was the widespread accusation that the prime minister all but endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in his campaign to unseat Obama in 2012 .\nBut just as Netanyahu -- if he indeed tried -- was unsuccessful in swaying that election , American presidents have also come up short .\nThere 's no clear indication right now that Netanyahu will be hurt by the U.S.-Israel row come Election Day . Netanyahu 's party saw a modest boost in one poll after Netanyahu 's speech to Congress . Several polls in recent days , however , suggest leading opposition party Zionist Union is gaining momentum in the wake of Netanyahu 's American saga . And the large number of undecideds and polling see-sawing throughout the race leave the final result very much in question .\nZionist Union leader Isaac Herzog has been taking every opportunity to use Netanyahu 's frayed ties with the U.S. administration against him .\n`` The painful truth is that after all the applause , Netanyahu is alone and Israel is isolated , '' Herzog said after Netanyahu 's speech to Congress .\nBut there are other issues -- such as economic woes and questions about Israel 's security -- that are also spelling trouble for Netanyahu .\nAnd for all those alienated from Netanyahu 's Likud party by the breach with the United States , there are many in Israel who could reward him for it . Israelis have been mistrustful of Obama and have disliked many of his Middle East positions . Some believe being seen as standing up to the U.S. president will work in the prime minister 's favor .\n`` I think the people of Israel understand that the prime minister is representing our needs , '' said Danny Danon , a Likud Knesset member . `` I do n't think criticism from the administration will affect them . ''\nAnd while Netanyahu faces condemnation from the Obama administration and top Democratic officials , he 's also enjoying widespread praise from Republicans . The White House may have panned Netanyahu 's speech , but on Capitol Hill , the prime minister got standing ovations reminiscent of State of the Union addresses .\nZalman Shoval , a former ambassador to the U.S. and Netanyahu confidant , said the lack of uniform condemnation and public wariness about Obama could cancel out any loss of support due to U.S.-Israel tensions .\n`` It 's very difficult to gauge how much of an influence any sort of statement or implication or whatever insinuation can really have on the election battle here , '' he said .\nSeveral Israeli lawmakers -- on both sides of the aisle -- doubted whether the Obama administration was actively trying to influence the election .\nA skeptical Danon was joined by Labor 's Nachman Shai . He said that U.S. officials had simply `` reacted and responded '' to the `` unprecedented '' nature of Netanyahu 's visit .\nErel Margalit , another Labor Knesset member , agreed . `` The administration responded to what was a frontal attack on its strategy in a way that was unprecedented . ''\nHe added , however , `` Let 's distinguish between two things : What they want in their heart and what they 're doing . ''\nObama 's unpopularity is part of the reason Netanyahu 's opponents on the left are careful not to play up any White House role in the elections . And Netanyahu and his allies are cautious not to reinforce the notion of a rift or go on the offensive against an administration they hope to mend relations with if Netanyahu is reelected .\nThe Netanyahu campaign would n't comment on whether the White House was trying to unseat the prime minister . But in the media , the candidate has lashed out at a `` worldwide effort '' to remove him from office .\nAides explained his remarks as referring to a campaign aiming to change the government . One Netanyahu campaign official said money was coming from `` every corner of the Earth . ''\nThat effort 's being led by V15 , a grassroots progressive movement with Obama campaign field director Jeremy Bird as a leading consultant .\nJUST WATCHED Some Israelis rally for political change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Some Israelis rally for political change 02:08\nBird is just the latest in a long line of American political operatives and pollsters who have traveled across the ocean to help Israeli politicians .\nDemocratic consultants James Carville and Stanley Greenberg helped Barak in 1999 , and Democratic veteran Paul Begala ( who is also a CNN analyst ) is now aiding Herzog . On the Republican side , digital strategist Vincent Harris , who now works for Sen. Rand Paul , signed up to help Netanyahu 's campaign this year .\nProminent Republican donors have also offered him support , perhaps no one more so than Sheldon Adelson . Adelson , the American casino magnate who spent more than $ 200 million backing Republicans in the 2012 presidential election , launched an Israeli newspaper , `` Israel Today , '' that vocally supports Netanyahu .\nDistributed in the street and at train stations , the newspaper is free and has become the most-read in Israel .\nAdelson was also present as Netanyahu delivered his address to Congress . His support is yet another reason some Democrats in Washington are less than fond of the prime minister .\nWhile the Obama administration may not be leading an overt effort to undermine Netanyahu , Miller , the former State Department official , said there 's no doubt `` corks will be popping at the White House and State Department if Netanyahu loses . ''", "Israel 's Election : Exit Polls Show Netanyahu 's Likud , Opposition In Tight Race\nExit polls released after the close of voting in Israel 's national election show that the race is too close to call .\nIsrael 's Channel 1 and Channel 10 both said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's Likud party and Isaac Herzog 's Zionist Union secured 27 seats each in the 120-seat Knesset .

Netanyahu ruled that out in the last days of campaigning . ''\nAnd , the Israeli prime minister , in a Facebook post , claimed a `` great victory against all odds .

Security Council resolution to pass that seeks to permanently change the international legal status of so-called Israeli \u201c settlements \u201d in Jerusalem and the disputed West Bank . Departing from almost 50 years of bipartisan American precedent \u2014 and from the administration \u2019 s own past practice \u2014 the Obama administration abstained from a vote for the resolution demanding that Israel \u201c cease all settlement activities \u201d and declaring that all existing settlements were in \u201c flagrant violation \u201d of international law .\nJust yesterday the resolution appeared dead , as Egypt , the resolution \u2019 s original sponsor , withdrew it under pressure from the incoming Trump administration . The president-elect took the unusual step of injecting himself into a U.N. controversy before taking office precisely because the Obama foreign-policy team was broadcasting its intent to abstain . Incredibly , however , four nations with precisely zero security interests at stake in the Middle East \u2014 New Zealand , Malaysia , Venezuela , and Senegal \u2014 revived the resolution and forced a vote .\nThe administration \u2019 s fecklessness has harmed Israel , endangers ordinary Israelis , and hurts the elusive quest for an enduring peace . Moreover , the Trump administration is powerless to revoke the resolution : It would have to introduce and pass a new resolution , and either Russia or China would be sure to veto it . Thus , Israel will find itself at the bargaining table in any future peace negotiation with Palestinian territorial demands backed by the U.N. \u2019 s most powerful body .\nBy declaring that settlements \u2014 including \u201c settlements \u201d in Israel \u2019 s capital \u2014 violate international law , the resolution purports to carve into stone the armistice lines that existed at the end of Israel \u2019 s war for independence . Yet these lines didn \u2019 t become lawful permanent borders precisely because hostile Arab nations specifically refused to recognize the existing battle lines as Israel \u2019 s border , specifically declined to create a Palestinian state , and instead maintained a posture of armed hostility to Israel . Indeed , since the West Bank hasn \u2019 t been part of a sovereign nation since the fall of the Ottoman Empire , the so-called occupied territories aren \u2019 t truly \u201c occupied \u201d under international law . They \u2019 re more accurately termed \u201c disputed \u201d territories , with the precise resolution of the dispute to be negotiated by the relevant parties .\nThe administration \u2019 s fecklessness has harmed Israel , endangers ordinary Israelis , and hurts the elusive quest for an enduring peace .\nThere are implications for ordinary Israelis as well . If an Israeli lives in a suburb of Jerusalem , is he or she now a criminal ? Can he be arrested and tried in activist courts in Europe or in international legal tribunals ? Radical U.N. action will only harden Palestinian intransigence and worsen already rising anti-Semitism ( thinly disguised as anti-Zionism ) on the international left . To put this radical resolution in context , under its terms , it is now an alleged violation of international law that the Western Wall remains in Israeli hands .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to interpret the Obama administration \u2019 s actions as anything other than a parting shot at Israel and its prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu . The Obama administration \u2019 s frustrations with the Netanyahu government are well known , but now was hardly the time to break with almost 50 years of American policy , and frustration or spite were hardly sufficient reasons . As Trump said in his statement , if there is to be peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians , \u201c it will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations . \u201d\nThe world will soon move on from Barack Obama , but he \u2019 s doing his best to extend his legacy of failure and appeasement . The Palestinians deserved a rebuke . Instead they received a gift . Our closest Middle Eastern ally will pay the price .", "Egypt 's president on Thursday issued constitutional amendments that placed him above judicial oversight and ordered the retrial of Hosni Mubarak for the killing of protesters in last year 's uprising .\nMohammed Morsi also decreed immunity for the Islamist-dominated panel drafting a new constitution from any possible court decisions to dissolve it , a threat that had been hanging over the controversial assembly .\nLiberal and Christian members withdrew from the assembly during the past week to protest what they say is the hijacking of the process by Morsi 's allies , who they saw are trying to push through a document that will have an Islamist slant marginalizing women and minority Christians and infringing on personal liberties . Several courts have been looking into cases demanding the dissolution of the panel .\nThe Egyptian leader also decreed that all decisions he has made since taking office in June and until a new constitution is adopted and a new parliament is elected -- which is not expected before next spring -- are not subject to appeal in court or by any other authority . He also barred any court from dissolving the Islamist-led upper house of parliament , a largely toothless body that has also faced court cases .\nThe moves effectively remove any oversight on Morsi , the longtime Muslim Brotherhood figure who became Egypt 's first freely elected president last summer after the Feb. 11 , 2011 fall of autocrat Hosni Mubarak . They come as Morsi is riding high on lavish praise from President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for mediating an end to eight days of fighting between Israel and Gaza 's Hamas rulers .\nMorsi not only holds executive power , he also has legislative authority after a previous court ruling just before he took office on June 30 dissolved the powerful lower house of parliament , which was led by the Brotherhood . With two branches of power in his hands , Morsi has had repeated frictions with the third , the judiciary , over recent months .\n`` Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt 's new pharaoh , '' pro-reform leader Mohamed ElBaradei wrote on his Twitter account . `` A major blow to the revolution that could have dire consequences . ''\nThe president made most of the changes Thursday by issuing a declaration amending what has become a patchwork interim constitution in effect since Mubarak 's fall . The military , which took power after Mubarak , set the precedent for the executive unilaterally issuing constitutional changes , which it did several times during its 16-month rule .\nMorsi on Thursday extended by two months the deadline for the assembly to produce a draft for a new constitution , apparently to give members more time to iron out their differences .\nThe moves are likely to fuel growing public criticism that Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood have monopolized power while doing little to tackle the country 's endemic woes . Thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Cairo for the fourth day running to protest against Morsi 's policies and criticize the Muslim Brotherhood , the fundamentalist group from which the Egyptian leader hails .\nThe decree for a retrial of Mubarak appeared aimed at making a gesture to the public . The decree called for `` new investigations and trials '' against those who held `` political or executive '' positions in the old regime and who are accused of killing protesters .\nMubarak was convicted in June to life in prison for failing to stop the killing of protesters during last year 's uprising against his rule , but many Egyptians were angered that he was n't convicted of actually ordering the crackdown and that his security chief , Habib el-Adly , was not sentenced to death . Several top police commanders were acquitted , and Mubarak and his sons were found not guilty of corruption charges .\nBut the decree would not mean retrials for the dozens of lower-level police officers who have been acquitted or received suspended sentences in trials for killing protesters -- verdicts that have outraged many Egyptians .\nThat exclusion will guarantee Morsi the loyalty of the powerful but hated police force which had abandoned the streets for more than a year after Mubarak 's ouster by a popular uprising motivated in large part by the human rights violations of the police and the notorious security services .\nMorsi on Thursday also fired the country 's top prosecutor , Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud , who has been in the job since 2006 . A Mubarak-era appointee , Mahmoud has faced widespread accusations that his office did a shoddy job collecting evidence against Mubarak , el-Adly and the police commanders .\nMorsi first fired Mahmoud in October but had to rescind his decision when he found that the powers of his office do not empower him to do so . So on Thursday , he decreed that the prosecutor general could serve in office only for four years , with immediate effect . Morsi replaced Mahmoud with Talaat Abdullah , a career judge .\nShortly before Morsi 's decisions were announced , hundreds of Morsi supporters gathered outside Mahmoud 's office chanting slogans against him and demanding the `` cleansing of the judiciary . ''\nThursday 's decisions were read on state television by Morsi 's spokesman , Yasser Ali . In a throwback to the days of the authoritarian Mubarak and his predecessor Anwar Sadat and Gamal Abdel-Nasser , the television followed up with a slew of nationalist songs . The introductions of the decrees declared that they were designed to `` protect '' the revolution and dismantle the old regime , a nod to the revolutionaries who have long complained that not enough was being done to reform the country after Mubarak 's 29-year rule .\nMorsi narrowly won the presidency -- about 52 percent of the vote -- to become Egypt 's first freely elected and civilian president , ending nearly six decades of de facto military rule .", "Story highlights President Obama is visiting Israel , will meet with Benjamin Netanyahu\nAaron David Miller : Obama 's attempt to repair relationship with Netanyahu is smart\nHe says Netanyahu is mindful of his legacy to avoid being seen as a do-nothing leader\nMiller : Fighting has n't worked before ; Obama and Netanyahu can try to cooperate instead\nDo you want to understand why President Obama is visiting Israel so early in his second term ? Think of two words : Management and legacy . And they go together .\nRight now in the cruel and unforgiving foreign policy world in which America is trapped , Barack Obama stands to be the American president on whose watch two catastrophes loom : Bomb Iran or see Iran with a bomb , and the demise of the two-state solution .\nIsrael figures centrally in both issues . If the president is to manage these issues effectively , he needs to find a way to work with Benjamin Netanyahu and the new Israeli government . That effort begins this week .\nSince the state of Israel was created in 1948 , only four American presidents have visited the country while in office ( Nixon , Carter , Clinton and Bush 43 ) . And only one -- Jimmy Carter -- achieved a truly significant result by brokering the terms of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty that was signed at the White House in March 1979 .\nSo a visit by an American president can be important ; but it is rare . The logic behind Obama 's visit , however , is not to hammer out immediate results or to achieve a breakthrough in a box .\nObama is already an historic president -- but he is not yet a great one . If he were to achieve that status , it would probably be through big pieces of domestic agenda such as health care , immigration reform , gun control , and of course , economic recovery . He 's unlikely to get there by chasing windmills abroad like Syria or Israeli-Palestinian peace .\nStill , he ca n't forget about the world , least of all the broken , angry and dysfunctional Middle East that could cause him more headaches and undermine his domestic agendas if left unattended . The Iranian nuclear issue could rattle regional stability , send markets plunging and oil prices rising .\nObama needs a new approach . Trying to repair his relationship with Netanyahu is smart politics . If the president wants to regain control of the House in 2014 and take an issue away from the Republicans in the process , he needs to remove the image that somehow he 's against Netanyahu and does n't care emotionally about Israel .

Now , he can test to see if he and Netanyahu can get on the same page .\nWill it work ? Israel , of course , is n't the only actor in these stories . There are Iranians and Palestinians , too . But working with Netanyahu may give the president the time he needs to pursue diplomacy with Iran and perhaps a deal with the Palestinians . The Israeli election has weakened Netanyahu and brought in new coalition partners who may well want to improve relations with a U.S. president .\nNetanyahu knows that his political career ca n't last forever . At the moment , he 's being challenged by two newcomers -- Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett . Both are remarkably popular . Netanyahu 's best chance in regaining momentum is to shift the conversations to Iran and foreign policy where he 's strongest . And for this , paradoxically , he needs Obama 's help .\nMoreover , next year Netanyahu will have served longer than any other prime minister in Israel 's history . He may be thinking about his legacy and avoiding the charge that he was a do-nothing leader . Again , the U.S. is the key ; and Bibi ca n't afford to alienate Obama .\nWhat makes all of this potentially realistic -- and not a fantasy -- is that the deals on the table are not transformational ones where weak and constrained leaders need to push for impossible goals or make decisions beyond their capacities .\nNo grand bargains or conflict-ending agreements are possible now with the mullahs or between Israelis and Palestinians . There 's not enough confidence , too little trust , too much domestic politics and too many gaps on the big issues . But smaller deals may be possible .\nFor example , the two leaders can pursue an interim approach that caps Iran 's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief which would give Iran and the international community a way out of the current choices -- bomb or allow Teheran to get the bomb .\nOn the Palestinian issue , the Israelis and Palestinians can quietly explore with the U.S. and with one another how much common ground they may have on the core final status issues while trying to improve the interim situation through security cooperation , loosening up of economic restrictions , and international support for Palestinian institutions .\nNone of these strategies are perfect , but they are starters . And so smartly and rightly , President Obama is going to Israel early ( when there are no expectations ) and with a view toward giving himself time to reshape his relationship with Netanyahu , building one with the Israeli public , and testing the proposition that he can try to develop some consensus in Israel .\nFighting off and on over the past four years clearly has n't worked . Maybe trying to cooperate over the next four just might .", "Iran has backed Syria 's `` right to defend itself '' after Israel launched strikes on what it said was Iranian military infrastructure inside Syria .\nIn the first comments by Iran since Thursday 's wave of strikes , the foreign ministry condemned the `` blatant violation of Syria 's sovereignty '' .\nThe strikes were the heaviest carried out by Israel on Syria in decades .\nThey came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights .\nIsrael said Iranian fighters had carried out that attack .

They include what it said were :\nInstallations at Tel Gharba , Tel Kleb , Nabi Yusha and Tel Maqdad\nAn `` Iranian Logistics Compound '' , 10km north-west of the capital ( pictured below )\nUS President Donald Trump 's abandonment on Tuesday of a landmark international deal to curb Iran 's nuclear programme - an agreement fiercely opposed by Mr Netanyahu - has certainly raised tensions .\nBut Israel had already become increasingly worried about Iran 's military support of Syria . Mr Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria , including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets .\nIsrael 's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months .\nThey included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops .\nThe deal lifted sanctions on Iran from 2015 , allowing some big names - Boeing , Airbus , Total and Peugeot - to start doing business again .\nThe re-imposition of sanctions has thrown all that into doubt . US firms have six months to stop trading with Iran . European companies , for instance Airbus , are affected too as they buy parts from the US .\nThe sanctions issue has added to tensions between the US and its European allies over the nuclear deal . French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says European companies should not have to pay for the US decision .\nThe economy of Iran , a big exporter of oil and gas , is likely to be adversely affected .", "ROME\u2013Just when you thought the Vatican \u2018 s image problem couldn \u2019 t get any worse , what with endemic clerical child abuse and a near bankrupt American arm of the church , it does . A new report pulls back the red velvet curtain on a bizarre new tidbit about the Vatican \u2018 s other dirty little secret : its finances .\nThe latest twist started to unravel in October when Pope Francis ordered Swiss Guard gendarmes to raid the Holy See \u2019 s Financial Information Authority ( AIF ) office inside Vatican City , carrying out boxes of papers and computer hard drives . They tacked up what amounted to a \u201c Wanted Dead or Alive \u201d sign on the Vatican \u2019 s fortified gates to keep out the administrators while they started sifting through reams of curious expenditures in the Vatican \u2019 s financial books .\nThey came up with quite a few surprises about the way money donated for the poor was being used , including some dubious real estate interests , connections to an even more dubious Maltese financier , and investments in movies that , good or bad , don \u2019 t exactly square with church doctrine .\nOne of the more peculiar items on the spreadsheet was property on Sloane Avenue in London . It included luxury apartments in a former Harrods warehouse . The Vatican press office said at the time further investigations would be \u201c carried out over time . \u201d\nAmong the latest of those investigations is a tie to the Centurion Global Fund based in Malta , which has proven itself to be a hotbed of corruption .

He alone decides how the Vatican money\u2013about $ 78 million\u2013entrusted to him through the Malta fund is spent to get the highest return .\nThe documents seen by Corriere Della Sera list his recent investments with the church \u2019 s money . Among them are around $ 2.2 million in a company called Italian Independent , run by Fiat founder Gianni Agnelli \u2019 s flamboyant grandson Lapo Elkann , who was arrested in New York in 2017 for faking his own kidnapping , allegedly to pay off a drug debt owed to a male escort .\nAnother $ 11 million went to an Italian businessman named Enrico Preziosi , who is an entrepreneur who owns the Genoa soccer team and who was caught up in a little legal trouble in the early 2000s for manipulating the price of soccer players to falsify accounting . He was fined around $ 15,000 and banned from soccer for four months .\n\u201c Investigations are in progress . \u201d \u2014 The Vatican Press Office\nBut the most curious item on the report to come out so far is a $ 4.5 million expenditure recorded in February of this year related to finance for the 2019 films Men in Black : International and Elton John \u2019 s rather steamy biopic Rocketman , which portrays the entertainer \u2019 s drug problems and is the first studio movie to portray gay sex between men in an authentic way .\nWhile investing in mainstream entertainment is hardly sinful , the great contradiction is that the Catholic Church preaches to the devout that homosexuality is a sin .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 reached out to Crasso in both his Swiss and Maltese offices and was told that he did not wish to comment at this time .\nThe Vatican press office has issued a statement that sheds very little light on the matter . \u201c Investigations are in progress , and lines of enquiry which may help clarify the position of the Holy See with respect to the aforementioned funds and any others , are currently being examined by the Vatican judiciary , in collaboration with the competent authorities , \u201d the statement reads .\nThe money that feeds the Centurion Fund reportedly comes from investments made by the pope \u2019 s \u201c Peter \u2019 s Pence \u201d charity , which is fed by global dioceses that collect the money specifically for the poor on one given day of the year , often the last Sunday in June which is close to the feast days of saints Peter and Paul .\nPeter \u2019 s Pence is not part of a local church \u2019 s Sunday collection basket , but a separate collection earmarked specifically for the papal fund . According to the charity \u2019 s website , the money is supposed to be channeled directly to the poor .\n\u201c The Peter \u2019 s Pence collection is a gesture of solidarity , \u201d the site states . \u201c Through it , every member of the faithful can participate in the Pope \u2019 s activity . It is an activity that supports the most needy and ecclesial communities in difficulty who approach the Apostolic See for help . \u201d\nWednesday , the Wall Street Journal reported that the fund , which brings in more than $ 55 million annually and is worth about $ 700 million to date , is also spent on filling the gaps in the Vatican \u2019 s internal administrative budget . The paper alleges that just 10 percent is spent on charitable works , according to documentation it obtained .\nWhether the pope knows the intricate details about where the money goes that he entrusts to his charity is unclear . But when he was asked about the growing financial scandal related to Peter \u2019 s Pence on a papal flight last month , the pontiff did little to clear it up .\n\u201c When the money from Peter \u2019 s Pence arrives , what do I do ? I put it in a drawer ? No , \u201d he said . \u201c This is bad administration . I try to make an investment and when I need to give , when there is a need , throughout the year , the money is taken and that capital does not devalue , it stays the same or it increases a bit. \u201d Or , it goes to Elton John \u2019 s biopic .", "As leaders sitting on two of Donald Trump 's business councils took stock of Trump 's repulsive defense of neo-Nazi and white supremacist violence , many concluded they just could n't stomach a continued alliance with Trump 's administration and decided to cut ties .\nBut what of religious leaders who also prize their access , like those sitting on Trump 's Evangelical Council ?\nx Not a single member of Trump 's Evangelical Council has resigned . We have learned corporate America has a greater moral compass . So so sad . \u2014 Matthew Dowd ( @ matthewjdowd ) August 16 , 2017\nThe fact that institutional leaders of conservative religious groups have entirely ceded their moral authority to the business community on issues of basic decency and human rights is a lesson LGBTQ Americans have learned repeatedly over the last decade . It was on full display last year in North Carolina , for instance , where businesses like PayPal led the charge in opposing HB2 , a bill targeting transgender individuals for discrimination .\nThe same was true the year before when companies like Salesforce and Angie 's List took on then-Gov . Mike Pence after he signed an Indiana law protecting businesses that discriminate against LGBTQ customers . That story repeated itself again this year during the right-wing push in Texas to prohibit transgender folks from using public restrooms corresponding to their gender . The bill just died this week .\nBut as all of those measures made national headlines , leaders of the evangelical and Catholic faiths fell silent , just like they have been in directly challenging Trump 's disastrous handling of the violence that took one life and injured 19 others last weekend .\nWhile the President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , Cardinal Daniel DiNardo , swiftly issued a statement last Saturday condemning the `` abhorrent acts of hatred '' in Charlottesville as `` an attack on the unity of our nation , '' he has said nothing following Trump 's defense of that very same violence .", "Media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement , Pope Francis said in an interview published on Wednesday .\nFrancis told the Belgian Catholic weekly Tertio that spreading disinformation was \u201c probably the greatest damage that the media can do \u201d and using communications for this rather than to educate the public amounted to a sin .\nUsing precise psychological terms , he said scandal-mongering media risked falling prey to coprophilia , or arousal from excrement , and consumers of these media risked coprophagia , or eating excrement .\nThe Argentine-born pontiff excused himself for using such terms in order to get his point across while answering a question about the correct use of the media .\n\u201c I think the media have to be very clear , very transparent , and not fall into \u2014 no offense intended \u2014 the sickness of coprophilia , that is , always wanting to cover scandals , covering nasty things , even if they are true , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia , a lot of damage can be done . \u201d\nThat section of the interview , all of which was distributed to reporters in an Italian translation of the interview in the pope \u2019 s native Spanish , contained some of the most blunt language the pontiff has ever used about the media .\nHe also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals .\n\u201c The means of communication have their own temptations , they can be tempted by slander , and therefore used to slander people , to smear them , this above all in the world of politics , \u201d he said . \u201c They can be used as means of defamation\u2026 \u201d\n\u201c No one has a right to do this . It is a sin and it is hurtful , \u201d he said .\nHe described disinformation as the greatest harm the media can do because \u201c it directs opinion in only one direction and omits the other part of the truth , \u201d he said .\nThe pope \u2019 s comments on disinformation followed widespread debate in the United States over whether fake news on the internet might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump .", "Religion is apparently weakening in America . A new report from the Pew Research Center shows that the percentage of Americans who say they believe in God , pray daily and attend church regularly is declining .\nThe share of Americans who say they are `` absolutely certain '' that God exists has dropped 8 percentage points , from 71 percent to 63 percent , since 2007 , when the last comparable study was made .\nThe percentage of adults who describe themselves as `` religiously affiliated '' has shrunk 6 points since 2007 , from 83 percent to 77 percent .\nThe shares of the U.S. adult population who consider religion `` very important '' to them , pray daily and attend services at least once a month have declined between 3 and 4 percentage points over the past eight years .\nThe shift is small but statistically significant , according to the authors , given that the changes have taken place in a relatively short period of time , and the survey sample is large enough ( about 35,000 U.S. adults ) to be considered reliable .\nSkepticism about religion is especially evident among young people . The Pew study found that barely a quarter of `` millennials '' ( born between 1981 and 1996 ) attend church services on a weekly basis , compared with more than half of U.S. adults born before 1946 . Only about 4 in 10 millennials say religion is important in their lives , compared with more than half of those who are older , including two-thirds of those born before 1946 .\nThe Pew researchers acknowledge that some young people may become more religious as they grow older , but their data suggest that the generational differences in religiosity could well endure . `` The oldest Millennials , now in their late 20s and early 30s , are generally less observant than they were seven years ago , '' the authors write . `` If these trends continue American society is likely to grow less religious even if those who are adults today maintain their current levels of religious commitment . ''\nThe weakening of religious beliefs and practices has clear political overtones . The growth in the number of religiously unaffiliated people is largely benefiting Democrats , for whom `` nones '' are now the single largest religious constituency . Evangelicals , meanwhile , constitute the largest religious group in the Republican Party , and the share of evangelicals who identify with the Republicans has grown since 2007 .\nIndeed , the Pew report suggests that polarization along religious lines may be increasing in the United States . While the percentage of Americans who say they do n't affiliate with any religious tradition is growing , those people who still identify with a religion are becoming even more devout . A growing share of the `` religiously affiliated '' say they regularly read scripture , participate in prayer groups and share their faith with others .", "A striking display of compassion from the brother of a murder victim to his killer was , to some , a heart-wrenching example of empathy . But to others , it was a painful example of African Americans forced to respond to acts of violence with understanding , writes Barrett Holmes Pitner .\nOn Wednesday , former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger , 31 , who is white , was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of her neighbour Botham Jean , who was black . She will be eligible for parole in 5 years .\nGuyger 's conviction was seen as a moment of justice for many observers since it is still relatively rare for police officers to be convicted of unlawful killings in America , yet many onlookers also thought her sentence was too lenient . However , the true shock occurred as Guyger received a profound - and controversial - amount of compassion from her victim 's family and the judge .\nFollowing Guyger 's sentencing , Jean 's 18-year-old brother Brandt took the stand and said `` I forgive you '' and `` I love you as a person and I do n't wish anything bad on you , '' before leaving the stand so that he could embrace Guyger .\nTheir hug lasted nearly a minute as those in the courtroom openly wept from this stunning show of compassion .\nSome seasoned court commentators described it as the most powerful moment they had ever seen in a courtroom . And it generated headlines all around the world .\nAfter Guyger and Brandt Jean 's embrace , Judge Tammy Kemp , who is black , left her judge 's bench and also embraced Guyger . Kemp gave Guyger a Bible and the two of them prayed together before Guyger was led away from the courtroom .\nIn most situations , compassion and empathy do not prompt heated debates , but in the US , the actions of Brandt Jean and Judge Kemp have rekindled a complex conversation about race and inequality . Some observers celebrated the humanity on display in the courtroom , and others questioned if it is just for African Americans to repeatedly take the moral high ground without an exception of reciprocity across America 's racial divide .\nFrequently , African American communities have responded to terror by expressing compassion and forgiveness to the perpetrators of terror , and have often invoked their Christian faith as the ideological foundation for their acts of forgiveness .\nFollowing the attack on Emanuel AME Church in Charleston , South Carolina by Dylann Roof on 17 June , 2015 that killed nine African American parishioners , the family members of the victims also told Roof that they forgave him . Roof has never admitted any remorse for his killings .\nDespite the clear religious overtones of the victim 's families actions , Justin Hansford , the executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard Law , contends that the culture of forgiveness that emanates from America 's black community derives from the US never condoning black anger when directed towards white Americans .\n`` We see the black community take the moral high ground because you do n't get the right to be angry with white people in America . If you 're angry it is seen as unjustified , '' says Hansford .\nAmerican culture has historically depicted slave rebellions as unwarranted acts of black aggression against white Americans , and as the black community has pursued freedom and equality there has always been a profound debate about the level of anger black America can constructively express towards white America .\nTitans of the black intelligentsia have long debated various approaches for black equality and the best ways to channel and express black anger . During the civil rights struggle of the 1960s , the conflicting philosophies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X highlighted this tension .\n`` There has always been a dichotomy between the Christian way of responding to injustice - turn the other cheek - and the black Muslims and their willingness to express anger and have a dignity with their expression of anger , '' says Hansford .\nMany black Americans have embraced the black Muslim community and the Black Panther movement because they can provide a constructive platform for expressing black anger at the systemic racial oppression the white community has created .\nWhen looking at the facts of the case , there are ample reasons for the black community to be angry .\nOn 6 September , 2018 , Guyger returned home to her apartment complex after finishing work as a Dallas police officer . Guyger claims to have mistakenly parked her car on the wrong floor , and walked into Jean 's apartment believing it to be her own . Upon seeing Jean on his couch eating ice cream , Guyger claims to have thought he was an intruder and , in a moment of fear , used her government issued handgun to shoot and kill Jean .\nInitially , Guyger was only charged with manslaughter and kept on the police force , but following public outrage she was then charged with murder and fired .\nGuyger has always contended that the killing was a tragic accident , and former Dallas police chief Craig Miller said that Guyger 's killing of Jean was `` justified '' because Guyger suffered from a temporary condition called `` inattentional blindness , '' which is defined as `` the failure to notice a fully-visible , but unexpected object because attention was engaged on another task , event , or object . ''\nEssentially , Miller believed that Guyger should not be charged with murder because she was not paying attention when she murdered Jean .\nAccording to Hansford , America 's cultural stifling and stigmatising of black anger has made forgiveness one of the few recourses for the black community . The alleged illegitimacy of African American anger has many American manifestations - notably the `` Angry Black Woman '' and `` dangerous '' black men - and America has long mythologized the alleged benefit of the black community forgiving white America .\nEven Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom 's Cabin , published in 1852 , which re-shaped American views on slavery , professed the supposed benefit of Christian love and black forgiveness as a way to overcome the cultural degradation of American slavery . Yet over 150 years later black Americans are still being unjustly murdered and terrorised , and forgiveness is still depicted as an adequate solution .\nBrandt Jean 's decision to forgive Guyger remains a personal decision , but Judge Kemp 's decision forces America to contend with the tragic subjectivity of our justice system .\nUnless Judge Kemp normally embraces , prays , and gifts a Bible to those she sends to prison , America must ask why Guyger warranted this degree of compassion and others did not . Does this undermine Kemp 's impartiality ?\n`` What is justice in this case ? If you 're going to bust into someone 's house and shoot them dead , and then get five years in prison and a hug from the judge . Are you okay with that ? And why do n't similar sentences and shows of compassion happen more often ? '' says Hansford .\nFor many members of the black community , who also struggle to express their anger at America 's systemic oppression , this trial represents one of many examples of how precarious and under threat black life has always been in America . Compassion might feel right in the moment , but the debate still rages as to whether it brings America closer to a semblance of racial equality .\nBarrett is a writer , journalist and filmmaker focusing on race , culture and politics", "Today , September 8 , I am holding a prayer vigil and rally for liberty in Grayson , Kentucky .

Now , just two months after the court 's lawless ruling , an elected county clerk has been put in jail by an unelected judge for refusing to issue a \u201c marriage '' license to a same-sex couple , removing all doubts about criminalization of Christianity in this country .\nWhen the people of Kentucky elected Democrat Kim Davis as county clerk , the state \u2019 s constitution affirmed that marriage is between one man and one woman . The amendment passed with 75 percent of the people \u2019 s vote .\nToday , I ask on behalf of Kim : \u201c Under what law is she authorized to issue homosexual couples a marriage license ? \u201d Can you site the specific right in the Constitution ? Is there a statute , passed by Congress that actually says that the five unelected lawyers in the majority of the court \u2019 s opinion were right to throw out the very definition of marriage and make up one on their own ?\nToday , I ask on behalf of Kim : \u201c Under what law is she authorized to issue homosexual couples a marriage license ? \u201d Can you site the specific right in the Constitution ?\nIn the Obergefell decision , the Supreme Court ruled same-sex couples have the right to get married . Whether you personally agree with that or not does n't matter in Kim \u2019 s case . What does matter , is that the Supreme Court can not and did not make a law . It only made a ruling on a law .\nKim 's stand for religious liberty is a pivotal moment in our nation 's history . Will we continue to pretend as though the Supreme Court is the `` Supreme Branch '' with the authority and ability to make laws ? It most certainly is not .

It is no more the `` Supreme Branch '' than it is the `` Supreme Being '' with the authority to redefine the laws of nature or of nature 's God !\nWhat we know for sure is that The Judicial Branch is constitutionally prohibited from writing laws , there are religious liberty protections in the Kentucky constitution and Kentucky statute and the plaintiffs in the case did not seek Kim \u2019 s incarceration .

We did not fight a revolution against the tyranny of one unelected monarch so we could surrender our freedoms and abandon our Constitution to the tyranny of five unaccountable , unelected lawyers .\nThis shredding of the most fundamental civil rights of our citizens can not stand .

''", "Yesterday , the Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision in Murphy v. NCAA , striking down a federal law that blocks states from legalizing sports gambling under their own state laws . The ruling is a major victory for federalism , and has important implications that go beyond the issue of sports gambling .\nMurphy invalidates a provision of the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act ( PASPA ) , which mandates that states may not `` sponsor , operate , advertise , promote , license , or authorize by law or compact '' sports betting . A coalition of sports leagues , including the NCAA , the NBA , the NFL , and Major League Baseball , filed a lawsuit arguing that New Jersey 's laws partially legalizing sports gambling within the state qualifies as `` authorization '' and thus violates PASPA . New Jersey argued that that PASPA violates the `` anti-commandeering '' principles of the Tenth Amendment . Under several longstanding Supreme Court precedents , the Tenth Amendment prevents the federal government from compelling the states to enforce federal law , including by forcing state legislatures to enact laws of their own . The Supreme Court majority ruled that PASPA is unconstitutional .\nMore : Winners & losers in Supreme Court sports betting decision : Vindication for Donald Trump ?\nMore : Listen up Supreme Court : Warrantless tracking of smartphones violates our rights\nTo get around the anti-commandeering rule , the sports leagues and the Trump administration claimed that there is a distinction between commandeering and federal laws blocking `` affirmative authorization '' of gambling under state law . By this reasoning , PASPA is not `` commandeering '' because it does not prevent complete legalization of sports gambling . It only bans state laws that affirmatively authorize gambling in some way , as New Jersey supposedly does by restricting it to some types of locations and limiting the range of teams that gamblers can bet on . Writing for a 7-2 Supreme Court majority , Justice Samuel Alito correctly concluded that \u201c this distinction is empty \u201d because laws banning affirmative \u201c authorization \u201d still violate `` the basic principle \u2026 that Congress can not issue direct orders to state legislatures . \u201d\nJustice Alito is right . The distinction between legalization and `` authorization '' makes little sense , because virtually any law that legalizes a previously banned activity , but does not completely abolish all restrictions on it , can be described as affirmative authorization . A decision upholding PASPA would essentially have gutted the anti-commandeering rule , as the federal government could easily get around it by adopting regulations preventing states from legalizing previously forbidden behavior , so long as the legalization law did not completely eliminate all legal constraints on it .\nThe ruling has obvious implications for sports betting , which states are now largely free to legalize as they see fit . Many may follow New Jersey 's example . Murphy is also significant for state policies legalizing other activities that the federal government may oppose , including marijuana , possession of some types of firearms , and others . The federal government can no longer block state legalization by passing laws that require states to continue to bar these activities under their own laws .\nMore : Supreme Court clerks are overwhelmingly white and male . Just like 20 years ago .\nThe federal government can still ban many such activities by making them directly illegal under federal law . But if it can not rely on the backing of the states and their own laws , enforcing such federal prohibitions in dissenting states can be expensive and difficult . In practice , federal prohibition of gambling , drugs and other activities relies heavily on state cooperation and support . Today 's decision reinforces the constitutional rule that empowers states to deny such assistance by refusing to enact state laws reinforcing federal prohibition . It also prevents the federal government from forcing the states to ban activities that Congress , for political reasons , does not want to forbid directly .\nPerhaps most importantly , Murphy v. NCAA makes clear that a solid majority of the Court is strongly committed to the anti-commandeering principle . The majority includes both the conservative justices and two liberals ( Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan ) . That bodes well for state efforts to oppose commandeering ( and perhaps other types of federal coercion ) in other areas . The most notable current examples are the sanctuary cities cases , in which the Trump administration has been trying to force state and local governments to assist federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants .\nLegal battles over federalism will surely continue . We are still a long way from where we should be on enforcing constitutional constraints on federal power .

In fact , Ramos \u2014 the very same umpire who penalized Williams a game for calling him a `` thief '' and accusing him of lying \u2014 has tolerated similar , and arguably worse , outbursts from male players on numerous occasions .\nAt the 2016 French Open , Australian player Nick Kyrgios blew up at Ramos after he was given a warning for raising his voice at a ballboy . `` That 's bulls * * t. Are you kidding ? '' Kyrgios shouted at the official . `` Bulls * * t , f * * * ing bulls * * t. '' He was given neither a point penalty , nor a game penalty .\nAt the 2017 French Open , former world No . 1 Rafael Nadal threatened Ramos , `` Give me the warnings you can , because you will not referee me anymore , '' he said . Nadal referenced his comments in a post-match press conference . No penalties were given .\n\u201c Give me the warnings you can because you will not referee me any more. \u201d Rafael Nadal to Carlos Ramos . Not surprisingly , no point taken against Nadal . Thanks Ramos and \u2066 @ usopen\u2069 for this master class on what it costs to be an assertive black woman . https : //t.co/GFchpFmiga \u2014 AnnieEllison ( @ AnnieEllison ) September 8 , 2018\nThat same tournament , defending champion Novak Djokovic got into an impassioned argument with Ramos , approaching the chair to tell him , `` You 're losing your mind . '' The skirmish came after Djokovic was docked a first serve for taking too long in the fourth set . He glowered at Ramos , motioned with his racket while uttering something in Serbian , then approached the chair to call the official 's sanity into question .\nWhile Djokovic was issued a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct , he was never officially penalized and ultimately went on to stage a five-set comeback . Perhaps Ramos considered Djokovic and Nadal 's outbursts as somehow less offensive than that of Serena Williams . Perhaps there is some sort of subconscious bias at play . But these sort of double standards extend far beyond a single chair umpire . They have been rampant for decades .\nDuring a semifinals match at the 2016 Cincinnati Masters in Ohio , British tennis star Andy Murray quite literally kicked a ball at the chair umpire 's head . And despite the ATP rulebook clearly stating that `` players shall not violently , dangerously or with anger hit , kick or throw a tennis ball while on the grounds of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match , '' Murray was not disqualified . The umpire simply hit him with a pointed look and Murray went on to win the match , advancing to the final .\nAt the 1991 U.S. Open , five-time champion Jimmy Connors got into a series of heated exchanges with chair umpire David Littlefield . Connors called Littlefield 's decisions `` bull crap '' and repeatedly shouted that Littlefield himself was `` an abortion . '' After each of Connors ' tirades , the crowd can be heard enthusiastically cheering along with him . Littlefield can be seen raising his eyebrows , occasionally extending prolonged , disapproving glances in Connors ' direction , but otherwise remaining measured and letting the outbursts slide . No penalties are given . No points taken . No games sacrificed . Connors goes on to win the match .\nPerhaps even more indicative of the gender disparity in this arena , is the fact that , at the start of the match , the CBS Sports commentator can be heard nonchalantly predicting , `` There will be some shouting and some emotional moments in this one . ''\nFor male players fired up by the heat of competition , this sort of behavior is simply shrugged off as normal . A testosterone-driven reality of the game . If you are one of the world 's top athletes , you have spent your entire life preparing for the highest level of competition . You have pushed your body to its limit . Of course you will become emotional when a pivotal point is on the line . Of course you will shout and call the umpire names . Those very same qualities got you to the top in the first place .\nIn fact , trash-talking is tolerated among male athletes in all sports . For athletes like MMA fighter Conor McGregor and NBA forward Draymond Green , it 's become an integral part of their persona . But when Hope Solo called the Swedish national team `` a bunch of cowards '' after a heated Women 's World Cup match , she was banned from U.S. soccer . Male athletes have done far worse and are still allowed to return . Numerous NFL players like Adrian Peterson , Michael Vick and Ray Lewis , have weathered controversies over child abuse , dog fighting and even a murder case , returning to multi-million dollar contracts and , in the case of Lewis , being inducted into the Hall of Fame .\nUnlike Solo , whose entire career and legacy were torpedoed by an instance of disciplined trash-talking , male players who achieve notoriety on the same grounds often go on to fame and fortune despite their unsportsmanlike behavior . What could serve as a better example than the fact that John McEnroe can be heard as a commentator in the Connors match above ?\nAfter years of quietly frustrating women around the world , this year 's Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 and the U.S. Open in particular \u2014 have thrust the issue of sexism in sports to the forefront . First , there was the controversy over Williams ' medically necessitated catsuit at the French Open . Then there was the penalty issued to Alize Cornet for taking off her shirt in the scorching heat at the U.S. Open , after her male peers were permitted to sit on the court shirtless for prolonged periods of time . Now Serena Williams has been fined 17,000 dollars for Saturday night 's polarizing code violations .\nThe stakes are dramatically high for all female athletes . However , they are even higher for Williams , who is barely a year out from nearly dying during childbirth , after yet again having to go above and beyond to be given equal treatment and receive the medical attention she desperately needed .\nSo , yes . She 's emotional . She 's frustrated . Williams is at , quite literally , the most important and hard-fought moment of her career , with the weight of viral ad campaigns and young players everywhere on her shoulders . The amount of criticism , disrespect and hardship she has overcome to dominate this sport would be enough to break other players , yet she has consistently proven herself in the face of it all .\nSo when she 's accused of cheating , of course she is angry . Who would n't be ? And when that accusation creates a domino effect that culminates in penalties dealt far less frequently to her male counterparts ? Of course she wants to scream at the top of her lungs .\nOn Saturday night , Naomi Osaka may have won the trophy , but tennis lost . And now sports fans across the globe are simply hoping this is the break point .", "President Donald Trump was greeted by a thunderous round of applause and cheers on Saturday in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , during the college football match-up between rival SEC teams LSU and Alabama .\n\u201c I love Alabama , \u201d Trump said Friday . \u201c I \u2019 m going to go watch a very good football game , which is tomorrow with LSU , and it \u2019 s going to be great . \u201d\n\u201c Ahead of an expected visit from President Donald Trump , Alabama \u2019 s Student Government Association sent a letter to students warning that they could lose their block seating for the rest of the season if they \u2018 engage in disruptive behavior \u2019 during the LSU game , \u201d The Tennessean reported . \u201c Jason Rothfarb , the SGA \u2019 s vice president of student affairs , sent out a letter citing the increased security at Saturday \u2019 s game between the second-ranked Crimson Tide and No . 1 LSU . President Donald Trump is expected to attend the game , and Alabama is warning fans to arrive early and expect longer waits getting into Bryant-Denny Stadium . \u201d\nThe letter stated in part : \u201c Any organizations that engage in disruptive behavior during the game will be removed from block seating instantly for the remainder of the season . \u201d\nMultiple reporters noted that there were repeated chants of \u201c USA ! \u201d after the crowd saw the president .\nDonald Trump and Melania in suite at 50 yard line behind LSU bench . Crowd cheers and chants USA . pic.twitter.com/1HAVzWHZ6s \u2014 Clay Travis ( @ ClayTravis ) November 9 , 2019\nAnother video from a different angle showed how the crowd reacted once the president arrived at his box suite to watch the game .\nNewsBusters \u2019 Vice President Dan Gainor tweeted , \u201c Welcome to real America ! ! ! \u201d\nWelcome to real America ! ! ! https : //t.co/Y4oSkEY9WA \u2014 Dan Gainor ( @ dangainor ) November 9 , 2019\nThe response that Trump got from the crowd is very different than the response he got while attending a Washington Nationals baseball game late last month , where the fans in the most Democrat part of the country booed him loudly on the same day that he announced that a military operation that he approved resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .\n\u201c His reception at the showdown between LSU and Alabama contrasted with the scene last month at Game 5 of the World Series in Washington , where was booed , and the mixed response to his appearance at UFC 244 in New York a week ago , \u201d ESPN reported . \u201c Trump , sitting one tier above the field , waved as fans turned around to look up at the president . He smiled , gave a thumbs-up a few times and threw a couple of fist bumps into the air as the Alabama fans waved red and white pompoms in response . First lady Melania Trump got an equally enthusiastic welcome . \u201d\nScotty Amos from Bossier City , Louisiana , told The Shreveport Times , \u201c It \u2019 s a big game . He \u2019 s a sports fan . Why would he not come ? The fans are excited . They are his people . Just imagine being a 19-year-old and getting to play in this game and the leader of the free world is here to watch you play . He wants to be here \u2014 to experience a big-time college game like this . \u201d\nWhen news broke that Trump was attending the game , LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said , \u201c You know , regardless of your political views , that \u2019 s pretty cool having the president at the game . Doesn \u2019 t matter whether you \u2019 re a Democrat or a Republican , the president at the game \u2019 s pretty cool . \u201d", "The Philadelphia Eagles hadn \u2019 t planned on fielding a 40-year-old quarterback in Sunday \u2019 s wild-card game against the Seattle Seahawks . But after starter Carson Wentz left with a concussion in the first quarter , all eyes turned to Josh McCown , who became the oldest part-time high school football coach to make his NFL playoff debut .\nPhiladelphia lost , 17\u20139 , but McCown performed about as well as you could expect from a quarterback of his caliber and age ( about as good as Tom Brady on Saturday , anyway ) . Coming into the game , the Eagles were already quite thin on offense , suffering injuries to their receivers and linemen throughout the season , so whoever was under center would \u2019 ve been dealt a tough hand . As shown with this surprisingly electric option play in the second quarter , head coach Doug Pederson placed no limitations on McCown\u2014except for , you know , the fact that he \u2019 s 40 and had never been in the playoffs before .\nMcCown was 18-for-24 for 174 passing yards and no touchdowns or turnovers . The Eagles had a chance at a game-tying drive before the two-minute warning , but McCown was sacked on fourth down and that was basically that . Despite exceeding the expectations of everyone but possibly his mother , McCown took the loss hard . It was very clear that he cared .\nJosh McCown & Zach Ertz share a moment after @ Eagles season ends . pic.twitter.com/d2zflRRLtU \u2014 Dan Gelston ( @ APgelston ) January 6 , 2020\nWhat \u2019 s interesting about McCown \u2019 s case is that before this season , the Eagles basically had to coax him out of a short retirement . In June , he had gone through the standard steps of a tenured NFL player \u2019 s send-off : a Players \u2019 Tribune article and an analyst gig on ESPN . The only thing missing was a CBD sponsorship . He signed with Philadelphia in August , when the Eagles were desperate for an able-bodied backup . McCown agreed to join because Philly is somewhat close to Charlotte , where his family lives , and the team allowed him to continue coaching football at Myers Park High School . The Eagles agreed to this because they were using him as an insurance policy , and besides , Myers Park \u2019 s season ended in November . ( The Mustangs went 11\u20130 in the regular season but lost in the third round of the playoffs to Richmond . Those teens and McCown can now commiserate . ) During the regular season , as ESPN \u2019 s Tim McManus reported , McCown usually took private jets on Mondays to help out with the Mustangs \u2019 game plan and would head back to the high school team on Fridays for the actual games before returning to the Eagles on Saturday morning .\nThere \u2019 s nothing wrong with any of this . If anything , McCown \u2019 s competent performance in the wild-card round shows the league places too much emphasis on absolute , 24/7 commitment from its players . Sunday \u2019 s Seahawks-Eagles game should silence the notion that players must eat , sleep , breathe , and puke football in order to succeed in the NFL . That argument has been a principal excuse that league defenders have proffered to explain why Colin Kaepernick is still a free agent . Kaepernick , observers may notice , does not coach a high school football team . Nor has he threatened to start coaching any high school sports teams should he acquire an NFL job . And yet , unlike McCown , he \u2019 s regularly accused of not wanting to play in the NFL , this despite his continued avowals that he does really , truly want to be a professional football player .\nThere \u2019 s no valid reason as to why Kaepernick isn \u2019 t on an NFL roster . The \u201c he \u2019 s been out of the league too long \u201d argument became void when Josh Johnson signed with Washington in 2018 after a five-year layoff between actual game snaps and led the team to a win in his first start . The \u201c he \u2019 s not good enough \u201d argument has been debunked given that Nathan Peterman and many more bad QBs have been signed and re-signed over the past few seasons . The \u201c he \u2019 s not committed \u201d argument should \u2019 ve been dead when he held his own workout in November and looked like a fresh-armed quarterback ready to compete for a roster spot . But McCown \u2019 s retirement and unretirement really seals the deal . If a veteran quarterback can prepare for his primary job while also maintaining a coaching gig on the side , Kaepernick could surely handle his various interests . A pro football player doesn \u2019 t need to be a north-south meathead with blinders on to succeed , as has been proved not only by McCown but by Kenny Stills ( who \u2019 s on the Houston Texans and still in the playoffs ) , Eric Reid , Arian Foster , Chris Long , and others .\nThe NFL has gone to great lengths to pretend that Kaepernick\u2014who became the target of every Facebook uncle \u2019 s ire when he began taking a knee during the national anthem and spoke out against social injustices against black Americans\u2014is being held back only by his own skills . Meanwhile , someone like McCown is able to play competently and maintain an immensely more complicated work-life balance with little to no backlash from NFL personnel or fans . What , pray tell , could be the difference here ?", "( CNN ) -- Like misery , failure loves company . Look at the immigration debate and how both liberals and conservatives -- and elected officials in both parties -- bungle it .\nPresident Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy . But now that he appears to be poised to take executive action to fix some of what 's broken with the country 's immigration system , Republicans in Congress sound like they 're about to overreact and join him in that failure .\nConservatives love to stir their flock by pushing the narrative that Obama is a staunch supporter of `` amnesty '' and that the President has always been in lockstep with immigration reform advocates .\nThat 's fiction . It 's been a rocky relationship . That 's because Obama belongs to that wing of the Democratic Party that has n't been interested in legalizing the undocumented and creating more competition in the job market for U.S. workers .\nObama broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as Secure Communities , which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law . He tried to fend off critics who wanted him to slow deportations by claiming that he did n't have the power to act `` as a king , '' only to later flip-flop and do just that during his 2012 re-election campaign when he unveiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) .\nObama deported a record 2 million people in five years , divided hundreds of thousands of families , failed to deal effectively with thousands of child refugees who streamed across the U.S.-Mexico border last summer and then broke another promise when he said he would take executive action on immigration before the midterm elections but blinked .\nNow , according to news reports that look like a trial balloon from the White House , Obama might , as early as this week , take unilateral action to offer several million illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation and perhaps even give some of them work permits .\nIf it materializes , I 'll be proved wrong . A few months ago , I said this would never happen and now it looks like it might .\nOptions include some common sense items : Eliminating Secure Communities ; broadening DACA by eliminating restrictions on how old applicants can be and when they had to have arrived ; restating that the enforcement priority should be to remove violent criminals and not housekeepers and students ; and expanding visa programs for immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens .\nBut it 's the final item on the list that could really upset the apple cart : deferred action for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents , which could result in as many as 4 million to 5 million people getting a temporary reprieve from deportation . When those undocumented college students known as DREAMers first argued for special treatment , the claim was based on the simple idea that they were brought here as children and thus did n't intentionally choose to break the law .\nFair enough . But the same thing ca n't be said of their parents , who did intentionally break the law . Now what ? Is there a new argument ?\nBesides , if Obama offers deferred action to parents , it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported .\nThat has never been the case . Parents get deported all the time , and their U.S.-citizen kids either go with them or stay on this side of the border and get put in foster care . Republicans have been wrong all along . Now , if he goes too far , Obama could prove them right .\nIf the President follows through on the proposed course of action , both sides will need to calm down .\nThose on the left should hold their applause . By ending the deportation juggernaut , the President would merely be putting out a fire that he started . Besides , this is just a temporary reprieve that would require the undocumented to surrender to law enforcement officials , get fingerprinted and all the rest . And it could all be revoked by the next president .\nFinally , this is not what Obama promised way back when -- that he would work aggressively with Congress to pass legislation that would permanently improve the lives of millions . This is n't reform . It 's `` reform lite . ''\nYet at the same time , those on the right need to rein in their scorn . In the post 9/11 era , conservatives should n't need a reminder of something they 've been telling us for years : how sweeping can be the executive power of the president . As head of the executive branch , Obama naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law .\nRepublicans have no trouble deflecting criticism by reminding Latino voters that Obama is in charge of deportations . So , instead of threatening the suicidal tantrums of a government shutdown or impeachment , conservatives should pipe down and let him be in charge of deportations . That does n't just mean deciding who goes but also who stays .\nBesides , Republicans like to talk tough about illegal immigration and the need to uphold the `` rule of law '' but that slogan would mean more coming from them if they did n't always run away from enforcing those laws that target the root of illegal immigration : U.S. employers who hire the undocumented , many of whom contribute to the re-election campaigns of Republican lawmakers .\nWhat Obama has in mind is n't some kindhearted miracle or the coming of the apocalypse . It 's just a legitimate exercise of the power that any president would have under the Constitution and our system of government .\nI know that is n't sexy , or inspiring , or inflammatory . It wo n't help the parties fundraise . But it does have the advantage of being true .", "Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) wants to shift $ 350 billion from an untapped Treasury Department virus relief program to help Black Americans during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond .\nAccording to The Grio , Schumer said moving some of the $ 500 billion previously approved for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would lead to immediate and long-term changes to address systemic racism .\n\u201c Long before the pandemic , long before this recession , long before this year \u2019 s protests , structural inequalities have persisted in health care and housing , the economy , and education , \u201d Schumer said in a statement . \u201c COVID-19 has only magnified these injustices . \u201d\nSchumer \u2019 s proposal would shift $ 135 billion from the Treasury \u2019 s fund to child care and health care needs of people of color during the pandemic . The plan would also move $ 215 billion over five years into longer-term investments , including a housing down payment program , Medicaid expansion , and other services .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) is preparing to release its $ 1 trillion coronavirus relief package as soon as next week . The plan is a counteroffer to the $ 3 trillion proposal that House Democrats approved in May .\nFor months , McConnell has pushed aside requests for more money , saying the government should wait to see how the first infusion of money helps . However , the coronavirus pandemic has only gotten worse , and now red states such as Texas , Florida , and Kentucky are being overwhelmed .\n\u201c There were some that hoped this would go away sooner than it has , \u201d McConnell said Wednesday during a hospital visit in Kentucky , where he urged people to wear masks and social distance . \u201c The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand : This is not going away . \u201d\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to get worse in the U.S. , McConnell is trying to keep costs down . Both the House and Senate want to help schools reopen , provide unemployment benefits , and ramp up coronavirus testing , treatments , and a vaccine . However , they differ on how much money it will cost .\nIn their bill , the House provided $ 100 billion for school reopenings in an education stabilization fund they say could swell to $ 430 billion to include more money for child care , colleges , and other needs . Republicans are trying to spend significantly less , $ 50 to $ 75 billion , on education .\nThe White House has promised to open up more money for education as it continues to urge for schools across the country to open . White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Thursday that reopening schools remains a priority , even if the science says otherwise .\n\u201c The science should not stand in the way of this , \u201d McEnany said , adding it is \u201c perfectly safe \u201d to fully reopen all classrooms .", "Enough women \u2014 and men \u2014 have chosen political ideology over protecting gender equality , and that \u2019 s shameful .\nLast week , Virginia became the 38th state to pass the Equal Rights Amendment \u2014 which would be enough to finally ratify the amendment . But enough women and men have snubbed it for nearly five decades that now this milestone may already be legally DOA .\n\u201c In so many areas , we still have a long way to go , \u201d Democratic Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan said .\nMcClellan , one of the ERA \u2019 s sponsors , was referring to the plight of women in today \u2019 s corporate boardrooms and top political offices , but she may as well have applied those comments to the amendment itself .\nThe constitutional amendment , which Congress approved in 1972 , states that \u201c equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex . \u201d\nSupporters say the amendment is needed to provide explicit protection against discrimination based on sex . They say federal and local laws providing that protection can easily be changed .\nMore than an optics problem : Trump 's white , male team is a bad look for America and bad for national security , too\nSo , why did it fail to be ratified in at least 38 states by Congress \u2019 s imposed deadlines in 1977 and , later , 1982 ?\nWomen alone could have made this happen but didn \u2019 t . Too many of them have chosen political ideology over enshrining the protection in the U.S. Constitution . There is no other way to explain the fact it took 48 years to get the 38th state to ratify the amendment \u2014 and only because Democrats took control of Virginia \u2019 s Legislature .\nCritics , who happen to be primarily Republicans , say they don \u2019 t like it because the amendment would grant protections for abortion . Further , they say , it is no longer necessary because women already enjoyed \u201c equal protection \u201d under the 14th Amendment .\nUnder that logic , women would have no obstacles in the 21st century . But that \u2019 s just laughable . Women in America still make about 82 cents for every dollar men earn . Men are still kings of corporate boardrooms . No woman has ever occupied the White House . And things aren \u2019 t much better at the local and state level .\nNominating a woman can be a boost to Democrats : Is presidency out of reach for women ? Warren-Sanders tiff ends silence on insidious myth\nThere are enough women \u2014 and enough progressive men \u2014 in state legislatures to ratify this amendment and send a strong message . Arizona , Alabama , Arkansas , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , Missouri , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Utah have not ratified it .\nBut don \u2019 t hold your breath because enough Republican women are against it , leaving it to the courts to determine whether the ERA is really dead . A legal showdown is expected over how to proceed or whether too much time has passed since the congressional deadline , forcing supporters to start from scratch .\nAnd that \u2019 s just a pity and shameful , especially this year when the country celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment that gave U.S. women the right to vote .\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral , where this column originally appeared . Follow her on Twitter , @ elviadiaz1 .", "The attorneys general of Illinois , Virginia and Nevada filed a lawsuit Thursday demanding the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) .\nThe lawsuit , filed against the archivist of the United States in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , said the ERA should be ratified after Virginia became the 38th state to approve it earlier this month , despite the Justice Department issuing guidance that says the deadline for ratification has long since passed .\nThe vote in Richmond in support of the ERA crossed the threshold necessary for it to be added to the U.S. Constitution and set the stage for a constitutional convention .\n\u201c At that moment , the process set forth in Article V of the U.S. Constitution was complete , \u201d the lawsuit reads .\n\u201c After generations of effort , the women of this country are entitled to their rightful place in the Constitution . This Court should compel the Archivist to carry out his statutory duty of recognizing the complete and final adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment . \u201d\nThe ERA would add language to the Constitution ensuring that \u201c equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. \u201d It would also grant Congress the power to enforce the amendment .\nOpponents of the ERA have promised to fight it in court , citing a 1982 ratification deadline set by Congress . The Justice Department issued an opinion earlier this month saying the ERA is no longer legally pending before the states because the deadline has passed .\nThe National Archives and Records Administration , which oversees the ratification of constitutional amendments , said it would abide by that opinion .\nWomen \u2019 s rights advocates have led the nationwide effort for the amendment \u2019 s ratification , arguing it will protect women from discrimination and gender-based violence .\n\u201c For nearly 150 years , the Constitution did not acknowledge the existence of women . Now , 231 years since our country was founded and on the centennial anniversary of the nineteenth amendment , the American people have shown that they are as committed as ever to true equality by adopting the Equal Rights Amendment , \u201d said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring ( D ) .\n\u201c Women have always been endowed with equal rights , even though our country has wrongly failed to recognize them , \u201d added Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford ( D ) . \u201c The gravity of this movement should not be underplayed \u2014 today we are advocating for women \u2019 s rights here in Nevada and all over the country , and we are taking an essential stride towards inclusivity . \u201d", "In our founding documents , Billy Graham explains that \u2588\u2588\u2588 will help evangelical Christians interpret the news in a manner that reflects their faith . The impeachment of Donald Trump is a significant event in the story of our republic . It requires comment .\nThe typical CT approach is to stay above the fray and allow Christians with different political convictions to make their arguments in the public square , to encourage all to pursue justice according to their convictions and treat their political opposition as charitably as possible . We want CT to be a place that welcomes Christians from across the political spectrum , and reminds everyone that politics is not the end and purpose of our being . We take pride in the fact , for instance , that politics does not dominate our homepage .\nThat said , we do feel it necessary from time to time to make our own opinions on political matters clear\u2014always , as Graham encouraged us , doing so with both conviction and love . We love and pray for our president , as we love and pray for leaders ( as well as ordinary citizens ) on both sides of the political aisle .\nLet \u2019 s grant this to the president : The Democrats have had it out for him from day one , and therefore nearly everything they do is under a cloud of partisan suspicion . This has led many to suspect not only motives but facts in these recent impeachment hearings . And , no , Mr. Trump did not have a serious opportunity to offer his side of the story in the House hearings on impeachment .\nBut the facts in this instance are unambiguous : The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president \u2019 s political opponents . That is not only a violation of the Constitution ; more importantly , it is profoundly immoral .\nThe reason many are not shocked about this is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration . He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals . He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women , about which he remains proud . His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations , lies , and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused .\nTrump \u2019 s evangelical supporters have pointed to his Supreme Court nominees , his defense of religious liberty , and his stewardship of the economy , among other things , as achievements that justify their support of the president . We believe the impeachment hearings have made it absolutely clear , in a way the Mueller investigation did not , that President Trump has abused his authority for personal gain and betrayed his constitutional oath . The impeachment hearings have illuminated the president \u2019 s moral deficiencies for all to see . This damages the institution of the presidency , damages the reputation of our country , and damages both the spirit and the future of our people . None of the president \u2019 s positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character .\nThis concern for the character of our national leader is not new in CT . In 1998 , we wrote this :\nThe President 's failure to tell the truth\u2014even when cornered\u2014rips at the fabric of the nation . This is not a private affair . For above all , social intercourse is built on a presumption of trust : trust that the milk your grocer sells you is wholesome and pure ; trust that the money you put in your bank can be taken out of the bank ; trust that your babysitter , firefighters , clergy , and ambulance drivers will all do their best . And while politicians are notorious for breaking campaign promises , while in office they have a fundamental obligation to uphold our trust in them and to live by the law .\nUnsavory dealings and immoral acts by the President and those close to him have rendered this administration morally unable to lead .\nUnfortunately , the words that we applied to Mr. Clinton 20 years ago apply almost perfectly to our current president . Whether Mr. Trump should be removed from office by the Senate or by popular vote next election\u2014that is a matter of prudential judgment . That he should be removed , we believe , is not a matter of partisan loyalties but loyalty to the Creator of the Ten Commandments .\nTo the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr. Trump in spite of his blackened moral record , we might say this : Remember who you are and whom you serve . Consider how your justification of Mr. Trump influences your witness to your Lord and Savior . Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump \u2019 s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency . If we don \u2019 t reverse course now , will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come ? Can we say with a straight face that abortion is a great evil that can not be tolerated and , with the same straight face , say that the bent and broken character of our nation \u2019 s leader doesn \u2019 t really matter in the end ?\nWe have reserved judgment on Mr. Trump for years now . Some have criticized us for our reserve . But when it comes to condemning the behavior of another , patient charity must come first . So we have done our best to give evangelical Trump supporters their due , to try to understand their point of view , to see the prudential nature of so many political decisions they have made regarding Mr. Trump . To use an old clich\u00e9 , it \u2019 s time to call a spade a spade , to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game , we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence . And just when we think it \u2019 s time to push all our chips to the center of the table , that \u2019 s when the whole game will come crashing down . It will crash down on the reputation of evangelical religion and on the world \u2019 s understanding of the gospel . And it will come crashing down on a nation of men and women whose welfare is also our concern .", "Sen. Kamala Harris launches her campaign for president in Oakland , Calif. , January 27 , 2019 . ( Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters )\nUnmediated mass democracy would lead to the serfdom of minority groups and the smallest , poorest states .\nThe Senate . The Electoral College . The First Amendment . The Second Amendment . The Supreme Court . Is there a part of our constitutional order that the Democrats have not pledged to destroy ?\nThere are some Democrats out there in the sticks \u2014 a lot of them , in fact \u2014 who simply don \u2019 t understand the constitutional order . They believe that the United States is a democracy , John Adams et al . be damned , and , in fact , they often are confused by the frankly anti-democratic features of the American order , because they have been taught ( theirs is a pseudo-education consisting of buzzwords rather than an actual education ) that \u201c democratic \u201d means \u201c good \u201d and \u201c undemocratic \u201d means \u201c bad . \u201d\nBut the Democrats in Washington are a different story . Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris went to law school . They understand the American constitutional order just fine .\nThe American order is complex \u2014 it is much more sophisticated than \u201c democracy , \u201d which assumes that nothing stands between the individual and the national state except aggregation , that might ( defined as 50 percent + 1 ) makes right . The American order is based on the idea that the United States consists of many different kinds of people in many different kinds of communities , and that each of these has interests that are legitimate even when they conflict with the equally legitimate interests of other communities . The densely populous urban mode of life is not the only mode of life , and the people of the urban areas are not entitled by their greater numbers to dominate their fellow citizens in the less populous rural areas .\nThe basic units of the United States are , as the name suggests , the several states . The states created the federal government , not the other way around . The states are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government , which is their instrument , not their master . In this , the United States is fundamentally different from countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan , which have unitary national governments under which provincial distinctions are largely irrelevant .\nIn our system , the states matter . Under the Democrats \u2019 vision , some states matter : California , Texas , Florida , New York , Pennsylvania , Illinois , and Ohio , which , without the institutions of federalism , have among them the numbers and the power to effectively dominate the rest of the country .\nAt the time of the Founding , the people of the smaller states did not desire to enter into a union in which they and their interests would be dominated by the larger ones . The people of the smaller states still do not wish to be politically dominated by the larger ones . For that reason , the interests of the states as such \u2014 not mere aggregates of voters \u2014 are taken into consideration . The Senate , as originally organized , existed to preserve the interests of the states as such against the opportunism and predation of the more populous House of Representatives \u2014 and against the ambitions of the executive , too . Turning the Senate into an inflated version of the House was one of the progressives \u2019 first great victories against the Constitution of the United States and an important step toward the sort of mass democracy that our constitutional order is explicitly designed to prevent .\nBut the states have other protections as well , one of which is the Electoral College , which helps to ensure that the president \u2014 the Founders were right to fear presidential ambition \u2014 is not a mere tribune of the plebs , a rider upon \u201c the beast with many heads \u201d empowered by the mob at his back to abuse and dominate members of minority groups \u2014 smaller states , religious minorities , political minorities , etc .\nThe rights of minorities are further protected \u2014 from democracy \u2014 by the Constitution \u2019 s limitations on the power of the federal government and specifically by the Bill of Rights , which places some considerations above democracy : freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom of the press , the right to keep and bear arms , the right to security in one \u2019 s home and papers , etc . One of the main constitutional functions of the Supreme Court is to see to it that the federal government does not violate the Bill of Rights , even when We the People demand that it does \u2014 especially then , actually : Rights that enjoy wide popular support require very little constitutional protection . It is the unpopular rights that require protection .\nOf course there were blemishes and oversights . Even the enlightened minds of the 18th century were hostages of their time , and the interests of African Americans and women were not taken into consideration . Those defects were corrected , partly by the shedding of blood but to a great extent by constitutional amendments that abolished slavery , enfranchised women , and brought the American people at large more fully into the constitutional system . The preamble to the Constitution describes a \u201c more perfect union , \u201d which is not the same thing as a perfect union . The genius of leaders such as Susan B. Anthony and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was that their calls to radical change ran against the grain of American society at their time but were perfectly in tune with the American idea and the principles of the American order .\nThe Democrats \u2019 calls to radical change in 2019 are precisely the opposite : They are very much in keeping with the transient passions of the time but fundamentally opposed to the American constitutional order .\nThe Electoral College ensures that the citizens in the less popular states are not reduced to serfdom by the greater numbers ( and greater wealth ) of the people in the more populous states . This balancing of minority rights with democratic processes is a fundamental part of the American order ( properly understood , the value of plebiscitary democracy is not substantive \u2014 majorities are at least as likely to be wicked and oppressive as virtuous and just \u2014 but purely procedural ) , and the Electoral College is the instrument by which that principle is applied to the election of presidents . The Democrats desire to abolish the Electoral College for purely self-interested reasons of partisanship : They think that there would be more Democratic presidents under unmediated mass democracy .\nThe First Amendment ensures that all Americans have the right to engage in political speech . Democrats wish to put political speech under heavy regulation , so that the people holding political power set the rules under which they may be criticized and debated . The Democrats have attempted to gut the First Amendment under the guise of \u201c campaign finance \u201d regulation , as though the right of free speech could be separated from the means of speech . It is worth bearing in mind that the Democrats \u2019 latest attack on the First Amendment was occasioned by the desire of a political activist group to show a film critical of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the run-up to a presidential election \u2014 a film whose circulation the Democrats sought to prohibit as a \u201c campaign finance \u201d matter .\nThe Supreme Court stepped in to stop that , finding that the First Amendment means what it says . And now the Democrats propose to corrupt the Supreme Court , expanding the number of justices from nine to whatever number it takes for a future Democratic president to create a majority of Democratic partisans on the Court . They are counting on the same court-packing scheme to give them the power to effectively repeal the Second Amendment without having to bother to propose and ratify a constitutional amendment \u2014 a political fight that the Democrats would surely lose .\nWhat the Democrats are proposing \u2014 abolishing the constitutional protections afforded to smaller states and political minorities , perverting the Supreme Court , gutting the Bill of Rights \u2014 amounts in sum to a revolution , replacing our government with a government of a very different character and structure .\nThey are doing this mainly because the Constitution prevents them from achieving their immediate short-term political goals . And we should be clear about what those immediate political goals actually are : muzzling their political opponents and those with unpopular political views , disarming the citizenry , stripping minority groups of political power , and rigging the political system in favor of their own constituents . They would , if given the power , burn down the American constitutional order and replace it with something closer to ordinary mob rule , plain and unapologetic ochlocracy . The United States is not drifting into fascism or socialism \u2014 it is drifting into anarchy .\nThat \u2019 s quite a fit to throw over Mrs. Clinton being denied her tiara .\nThe Republican party likes to position itself as the defender of the Constitution . But with a few exceptions ( Senator Ben Sasse prominent among them ) , Republicans in elected office demonstrate very little appreciation for the actual stakes on the political table . For the moment , they are more concerned with defending the Trump administration \u2014 which , whatever you think of it , is a short-term concern \u2014 than with defending something that is far more important , far more precious , and , in all likelihood , impossible to replace . If 2016 taught us anything , it is that the Jeffersons and Madisons of this generation apparently are otherwise occupied , that our political leadership is for the time diminished , and that the institutions the Democrats propose to incinerate could not be rebuilt by contemporary Americans any more than modern Iraqis could successfully revive the Code of Hammurabi .", "The Tabqa airforce base , which was previously the Assad regime \u2019 s lone garrison in the northern region of Syria , has fallen to ISIS rebels , according to the Associated Press :\nIslamic State fighters captured a major military air base in northeastern Syria on Sunday , eliminating the last government-held outpost in a province otherwise dominated by the jihadi group , activists and state media said . Tabqa airfield -- home to several warplane squadrons , helicopters , tanks , artillery , and ammunition bunkers -- is the third military base in the area to fall to the extremists since last month . Those victories are part of the Islamic State group 's aggressive push to consolidate its hold on northern and eastern provinces , while also expanding the boundaries of its self-styled caliphate straddling the Syria-Iraq border .\nISIS ' raison d'etre is to establish an Islamic caliphate across the Middle East ; and in order to accomplish this , they have committed unspeakable war crimes to consolidate power . The fall of Tabqa , therefore , was no different :\nThe group 's trademark brutality was on full display after those victories . They killed army commanders and pro-government militiamen , decapitating them before putting their bodies and heads on display . The Observatory reported similar acts following the fall of Tabqa Sunday . In the neighboring province of Deir el-Zour , Islamic State fighters also have overwhelmed outposts held by Syrian rebels , systematically picking off towns and villages one by one through force and intimidation .\nThis victory is no doubt a symbolic and strategic one for ISIS , although it seems ISIS forces didn \u2019 t get everything they wanted :\nThe warplanes from the base had already been taken to other locations before ISIS took control , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported . It said ISIS fighters were seen carrying the heads of Syrian regime soldiers . Both sides were reported to have suffered heavy losses in the battle for the base .\nMeanwhile , this latest development intensifies the debate about whether the U.S. should extend its airstrike campaign across the Iraqi border into Syria . President Obama , for his part , has n't yet made up his mind on this score -- but has n't fully ruled out the possibility , either .\nPresident Obama is considering U.S. airstrikes in Syria against militants of the Islamic State , the White House said Friday . \u201c We \u2019 re not going to be restricted by borders , \u201d said Ben Rhodes , a national security adviser to the president . \u201c We \u2019 re actively considering what \u2019 s going to be necessary to deal with that threat. \u201d The bombing of targets in Syria would mark a significant expansion of Mr. Obama \u2019 s three-week-old air war against the Islamic State , which has been limited to targets of the militant group in northern Iraq . The U.S. has conducted nearly 100 airstrikes against the militants in Iraq since Aug. 8 , and some lawmakers have warned the White House against \u201c mission creep . \u201d\n\u201c Mission creep \u201d is indeed a cause for concern for this administration . But if the airstrikes could maybe make a significant difference on the ground ( as they seemingly did in Iraq ) such measures should at least be seriously debated .", "President Obama on Thursday downplayed the prospect of any imminent U.S. airstrikes in Syria , saying `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' and stressing that military advisers are still reviewing options for confronting Islamic State militants .\nAt the same time , the president bluntly ruled out U.S. military action for dealing with another international crisis -- mounting evidence of Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine . `` We are not taking military action to solve the Ukrainian problem , '' Obama said .\nThe president addressed both crises during remarks in the White House briefing room late Thursday afternoon , as Congress prepares to return from the summer recess . In recent days , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have demanded that the U.S. strategy for targeting the Islamic State be put to a vote on Capitol Hill , amid speculation the military campaign might expand into Syria .\nBut Obama stressed Thursday that `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' and pushed back on reports that , he said , suggest the country is about to go `` full scale on an elaborate strategy '' in the Middle East .\n`` The suggestion , I guess , has been that we 'll start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress , still out of town , is going to be left in the dark , '' he said . `` That 's not what 's going to happen . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest later clarified on CNN that the president referred specifically to Syria when he said there was no strategy yet .\nObama indicated that for the time being , the U.S. will continue to conduct airstrikes in northern Iraq and humanitarian missions , while working politically and diplomatically to `` cobble together '' a coalition for whatever the long-term strategy is .\nTo that end , he said he is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to build a `` coalition '' to confront the threat .\nReports about a potential expanded military campaign follow calls by some lawmakers to strike the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , in Syria as well as Iraq . Military leaders have also said the organization will have to be dealt with in some way on the Syrian side of the border .\nObama acknowledged Thursday that he 's directed military leaders to prepare a `` range of options '' on ISIS . He was heading next into a National Security Council meeting where he was expected to discuss the strategy with advisers .\n`` ISIL poses an immediate threat to the people of Iraq and the people of the region , '' Obama said , while calling for a `` broader , comprehensive strategy . ''\nBut he said he does n't want to `` put the cart before the horse . ''\nThe president said , once a strategy is formed , there `` will be a military aspect to that '' and might be a role for an `` international coalition '' providing air support .\nBut he was vague on the question of what to do in Syria . Amid speculation over whether the U.S. would ever partner with Bashar Assad to fight ISIS on that side of the border , Obama reiterated his view that `` Assad 's lost legitimacy . ''\nHe said the U.S. would continue to support the `` moderate opposition '' in the country , giving people a choice other than just Assad or ISIS .\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , after Obama 's remarks , urged the president to develop a `` regional strategy '' for the Islamic State and present it to Congress and the American people .\n`` If the President is prepared to engage Congress with a strategic plan to protect the U.S. and our allies from ISIL , I believe he will have significant congressional support , '' he said . `` But do n't forget , the threat from ISIL is real and it 's growing -- and it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response . ''\nThe president 's remarks also came amid increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine . Officials in Ukraine say two Russian military columns rolled into the southeastern part of the country after missiles were fired at a border post .\nObama on Thursday blamed Russia for the unrest , saying the country deliberately and repeatedly has violated Ukraine 's sovereignty . He said Russia is training , arming and funding pro-Russian separatists in Russia .\nObama , though , said a `` military solution to this problem is not going to be forthcoming . ''\nRather , he said he wants to continue to mobilize the international community to bring pressure on Russia . `` This ongoing Russian incursion into Ukraine will only bring more costs and consequences for Russia , '' Obama said .\nObama said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko will visit the White House next month , in what would be his first visit since becoming president . Obama said he also spoke by phone Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .\nIn a written statement , though , Sens . John McCain , R-Ariz. , and Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said Russia 's actions can only be described as a `` cross-border military invasion , '' adding : `` To claim it is anything other than that is to inhabit President Putin 's Orwellian universe . ''\nThey urged broader `` sectoral '' sanctions and U.S. and European military support for Ukraine .\n`` This is a moment to speak and act with clarity . A sovereign nation in the heart of Europe is being invaded by its larger neighbor , '' they said . `` If we will not or can not defend our own values now , as well as friends who share them , the future will be dark and dangerous indeed , not just for Ukraine but for us too . ''\nAt the end of Thursday 's remarks , Obama briefly addressed ongoing deliberations over possible executive action on immigration .\nRepublicans have voiced concern he 'll issue a mass reprieve in the coming weeks for illegal immigrants .\nObama did not indicate what he might decide but said : `` In the absence of congressional action , I 'm going to do what I can to make sure the system works better . ''", "President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements .\nObama , who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups , said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam .\n\u201c We must never accept the premise they put forward , because it is a lie , \u201d Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism . \u201c They are not religious leaders . They \u2019 re terrorists . And we are not at war with Islam . We are at war with people who have perverted Islam . \u201d\nDeadly attacks in Paris , Sydney and Copenhagen by individuals of Muslim background and possibly inspired by the brutal tactics of Islamic State , along with the group \u2019 s spread in Syria , Iraq and now Libya , have raised alarms in Europe and the U.S. about the danger of lone-wolf terrorists , driven by extremist ideology and difficult to detect before they act .\nAt the summit , the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations , law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism . It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part .\nObama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda \u201c deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims \u201d through videos , social media and other online outlets . He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists \u2019 best recruiting tool .\nIn the U.S. , he said , local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren \u2019 t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society .\n\u201c Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted , \u201d he said . \u201c We have to be sure that abuses stop , are not repeated , that we do not stigmatize entire communities . \u201d\nFormer Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore , who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans , called the conference a \u201c farce \u201d in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering \u201c pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs \u201d to Muslims here and overseas .\nThe administration \u2019 s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists . Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration \u2019 s motivation .\nThe Muslim Advocates , an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month , expressed concern that Obama \u2019 s requests for \u201c partnerships \u201d with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role .\nThey also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims , a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked .\n\u201c This whole day is focused on American Muslims , frankly , \u201d Farhana Khera , the group \u2019 s executive director , said in a telephone interview . \u201c It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans . \u201d\nObama is speaking on the topic again tomorrow at the State Department during a session that includes representatives from overseas , including France , Belgium , Mexico and Japan .", "The attack on a tunnel complex in remote eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the US military left 36 Islamic State group fighters dead and no civilian casualties , Afghanistan officials said Friday .\nThe attack was carried out in a remote mountainous area of Nangarhar province near the Pakistan border where there had been heavy fighting in recent weeks between Afghan forces and ISIS militants . The Ministry of Defense said in a statement that several ISIS caves and ammunition caches were destroyed by the giant bomb , which terrified villagers on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border with its `` earsplitting blast . ''\n`` This is the right weapon for the right target , '' said US Gen. John W. Nicholson , NATO commander in Afghanistan , at a news conference .\nThe bomb , known officially as a GBU-43B , or massive ordnance air blast weapon , unleashes 11 tons of explosives .\nGen. Daulat Waziri , spokesman for the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense , said the death toll of ISIS fighters could rise . He said the bombing was necessary because the tunnel complex was extremely hard to penetrate , with some as deep as 40 meters ( 43 yards ) .\n`` It was a strong position and four times we had operations ( attacking the site ) and it was not possible to advance , '' he said , adding that the road leading to the complex `` was full of mines . ''\nPakistani villagers living near the Afghan border said the explosion was so loud they thought a bomb had been dropped in their village by US warplanes targeting terrorists in Pakistan .\n`` I was sleeping when we heard a loud explosion . It was an earsplitting blast , '' said Shah Wali who lives in the village of Goor Gari , 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) from the border with Nangarhar . `` I jumped from my bed and came out of my home to see what has gone wrong in our village . ''\nMr. Wali said dozens of other villagers also came out of homes and later he went near the border , where he met with other residents . He said he could see smoke in the sky .\nThe US estimates 600 to 800 ISIS fighters are present in Afghanistan , mostly in Nangarhar . The US has concentrated heavily on combatting them while also supporting Afghan forces battling the Taliban . President Trump called Thursday 's operation a `` very , very successful mission . ''\n`` I want a hundred times more bombings on this group , '' said Hakim Khan , a resident of Achin district , the site of the blast .\nInamullah Meyakhil , spokesman for the central hospital in eastern Nangarhar province , said the facility had received no dead or wounded from the attack .\nDistrict Gov . Ismail Shinwari said there is no civilian property near the airstrike location .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThere was no immediate comment from the Islamic State group on the attack .\nThe Site Intelligence Group , which tracks extremist organizations , reported Friday on a statement from the Afghan Taliban condemning the US for its `` terrorist '' attack . The statement said it is the responsibility of Afghans to remove the Islamic State group from the country not the US .", "The discovery of the large camp attacked in October raised questions about the American military \u2019 s ability to detect and destroy a major Qaeda stronghold in the country , more than 14 years after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan drove out Al Qaeda and toppled the Taliban government that supported them .\nGeneral Campbell said at the time of the October raid that the camp was used by a new Qaeda offshoot called Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent , or AQIS . Ayman al-Zawahri , Al Qaeda \u2019 s overall leader , announced the creation of the affiliate in September 2014 largely in response to the rise of its rival , the Islamic State , which is also known as ISIS or ISIL . The wing , which American analysts say has several hundred fighters , is believed to be based in Pakistan and focused on India , Pakistan and other nations in southern Asia .\nAQIS fighters began migrating from sanctuaries in North Waziristan and eastern Afghanistan to the country \u2019 s southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar last year , after Pakistan launched a military offensive in the region , said Seth Jones , an Afghanistan specialist at the RAND Corporation . Kandahar and Helmand have not typically been havens for Al Qaeda .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been a relatively recent expansion to the south , \u201d Mr. Jones said .\nAfghan security officials say many of these foreign fighters filtering in are from Central Asia , and in many cases their affiliations are unknown . In the past , some of the groups have been affiliated with Al Qaeda , but there have also been reports of some of these fighters pledging allegiance to the Islamic State .\nOne American intelligence official sought to play down the menace from the new Qaeda offshoot , calling it \u201c a regional threat that is currently focusing on plotting attacks in Pakistan and establishing a presence in South Asia . Despite its safe haven , the group has not been seen conducting attacks against Afghan or Western targets in Afghanistan . \u201d\nThe emergence of new Qaeda training camps comes amid a widespread erosion in security in much of the country . \u201c In the second half of 2015 , the overall security situation in Afghanistan deteriorated , with an increase in effective insurgent attacks and higher A.N.D.S.F . and Taliban casualties , \u201d the Pentagon said in a report issued two weeks ago , using the initials for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces .\nGeneral Campbell told lawmakers that the Pakistani-based militancy , the Haqqani network , remains an important \u201c facilitator \u201d for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan . The two groups , he said , share a goal of \u201c expelling coalition forces , overthrowing the Afghan government , and re-establishing an extremist state . \u201d", "America \u2019 s rapidly-expanding war against ISIS won \u2019 t involve large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground , President Obama is promising . And it \u2019 s clear that airstrikes alone won \u2019 t beat back the extremist group . Which means that if the President wants to have any hope of meeting his far-reaching goal of destroying ISIS , he \u2019 s going to have to rely on private military contractors .\nAt the height of the Iraq war , these firms hired hundreds of thousands of people : guns-for-hire , IT geeks , logistics specialists , interrogators , and short order cooks to ladle out the slop at the military cafeteria . Over time , some of those contractors became the symbol for everything that was wrong with the Iraq war : hugely expensive , ineffective , and indifferent to Iraqi life . Contractors were at the middle of the war \u2019 s biggest scandals , from Abu Ghraib to Nissour Square . And it was the abductions and murder of Blackwater contractors that sparked one of Iraq 's biggest battles .\nNone of the five current and former contractors who spoke with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 expected a replay of last decade \u2019 s Iraq war . But they all said a major opportunity was coming\u2014both for them , and for Obama , who could use the private armies as a way to conceal just how many people will be fighting in this new conflict .\n\u201c Iraq this time around is not going to be as big as it was before , \u201d said Roger Carstens , a former special operations officer who has served as a contracted military adviser in Somalia and Afghanistan . \u201c That said , this new war will present an opportunity for the companies that have a resident train and advising capability to contribute to this new effort . \u201d\nPresident Obama has asked Congress to authorize $ 500 million to train a new Syrian opposition out of Saudi Arabia . That money would be part of a $ 5 billion fund Obama requested this spring from Congress to help train and equip U.S. allies to fight terrorists .\nOne U.S. military contractor working in Iraq who asked not to be named said , \u201c I can tell you the contractor-expat community is abuzz thinking this will lead to more work . We expect a much larger footprint than he is showing right now . \u201d\nThose expectations were whet earlier this summer , as ISIS was gaining ground in northern Iraq and the first U.S. special operations teams were arriving in Iraq , when the Pentagon asked military contractors to participate in two important surveys .\nThe first one , issued in July , asked the industry to give a rough estimate of the costs associated with building a new network of ten ground based communications satellite stations , known as VSATs in military lingo . VSATs were used by the U.S. military in the last decade throughout Iraq to provide forward operating bases with secure internet and voice communications .\nThe second one was more specific . It asked for estimates of the cost for \u201c Security Assistance Mentors and Advisers \u201d for Iraq \u2019 s ministry of defense and the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service .\nA Pentagon spokeswoman told the \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the notice was not meant to be a request for proposal or the formal opening of the bidding process , but rather a chance to gauge the interest and capabilities of contractors down the road .\nBut contractors tell The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that these bureaucratic notices\u2014plus a pledge from Obama to wage a long war against ISIS and train up Syrian and Iraqi fighters\u2014represent a business opportunity for an industry that has shrunk in recent years .\nIn 2008 there were 242,558 contractors working in the countries for U.S. Central Command , the area that includes Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Somalia , Pakistan and Yemen , three countries where the United States has helped train local forces and conducted air strikes , according to the Pentagon \u2019 s official estimate .\nThat was during the height of the last round of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . By this July , that number had shrunk to 66,123 , according to the Pentagon \u2019 s latest estimate of military contractors working in the countries covered by Central Command , with only 14,634 contractors operating outside of Afghanistan .\nBut that \u2019 s only a fraction of America \u2019 s privatized security apparatus operating overseas . The State Department also offers billions of dollars to conduct security for diplomats and other officials . In 2011 , the State Department awarded Triple Canopy a four year deal worth up to $ 1.5 billion to provide security for the airport in Baghdad , U.S. diplomats and other Americans in the country . A State Department audit of the contract ( PDF ) found that at a minimum the State Department overpaid for those services by millions .\n\u201c There has been consolidation after conflicts , \u201d said Doug Brooks , the president emeritus of the International Stability Operations Association , a trade association for professional military contractors . \u201c There is going to be business , you could say these are shoes instead of boots on the ground . But as in most cases these are going to be local faces who will be hired by these companies , who bring professionalism and training . They have been there already helping to build up the air force in Iraq . It won \u2019 t be like the past ten years , but there will be growth in services . \u201d\nThe shrinking market for military contractors led some of them to seek new patrons . In 2010 , for example , an African based military contractor named Saracen began training an anti-piracy force in Somalia with funding from the United Arab Emirates . When this reporter visited the base in 2012 , it was a privately-run outpost in Puntland with its own electricity generator , barracks , armory with former South African military officers giving basic training to locals .\nBut that experience led to some instability . After one of the South African trainers was murdered in 2012 by one of the recruits , the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the project .\nOne reason why the new war on ISIS won \u2019 t be like the old one against al Qaeda is because for now Obama has promised not to send ground forces to Iraq or Syria . The presence of U.S. forces overseas presents a number of opportunities for military contractors in providing everything from the dining facilities to the logistical transport for U.S. soldiers at war .\nAlso the budgets to fight al Qaeda and other groups expanded dramatically after 9/11 when many government institutions did not know exactly how to fight the new war . Blackwater\u2014the private military firm founded by former NAVY SEAL Erik Prince\u2014became a virtual extension of the CIA \u2019 s special activities division working to develop the deadly capability to target and kill al Qaeda operatives all over the world .\nIt was also Blackwater contractors working in Iraq to protect diplomatic convoys that shot what the Iraqi government said were 17 innocent protestors in the heart of Baghdad at Nisour Square . ( This summer , in the U.S. trial of the contractors , former employees of the company said they were responding to fire from the crowd . )\nThe legacy of Nisour square contributed to the decision of the Iraqi government in 2011 to decline to offer legal immunity to U.S. soldiers and military contractors . Carstens said that any new military contracts for Iraq that would involve training units of soldiers would have to include iron-clad guarantees that the contractors themselves would not be targeted by Iraqi courts . \u201c The companies will need to know that their contractors in Iraq and other places will have legal protections in case anything happens , \u201d he said .\nIraq recently promised immunity for U.S. troops\u2014and it \u2019 s likely Baghdad will do the same for contractors too . After all , Iraq \u2019 s government has also formally requested U.S. assistance in fighting ISIS and that help was clearly going to include military contractors .\n\u201c They are looking for the next big meal ticket and this could be it , \u201d said Sean McFate , a former military contractor for Dyncorp and the author of The Modern Mercenary : Private Armies and What They Mean for World Order . \u201c The things they will provide are logistical support , training or retraining security forces . \u201d\nMcFate said contractors gave Obama the opportunity to accomplish tasks normally associated with the U.S. military without sending boots on the ground . He said the training missions in particular \u201c would look like Iraqi military boots on the ground and not the U.S. military. \u201d But he said , \u201c It \u2019 s a political disguise . This is an industry that is a proxy , it is creating the environment of security and protection without too many U.S. soldiers on the ground . \u201d", "Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201c thousands of times \u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation 's economy , U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand .\n\u201c It was a gut-punch to North Korea , to let them know the international community is tired of it and we \u2019 re going to start fighting back , \u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201c The Story , '' in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions . \u201c Every dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets , they \u2019 re not feeding their people with it . They \u2019 re using it toward a nuclear weapons system . Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles . \u201d\nThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $ 1 billion off its $ 3 billion annual export revenue . The resolution , deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006 , was payback for Pyongyang \u2019 s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month , which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the only victory for Haley , who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution . She acknowledged that it was no easy feat , but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea \u2019 s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld .\n\u201c Ninety percent of the trade that North Korea has is with China . So that \u2019 s why they were so important to this resolution , \u201d she emphasized . \u201c China stepped up and said , we will follow through on these sanctions . And they encouraged the international community to follow it . When that missile test took off , they felt it in China . And they \u2019 re disturbed enough to say that they now have to do their part . \u201d\nNorth Korea responded Monday with threats and backlash , seemingly suggesting that the dictator Kim Jong Un was doubling down on his objective of developing a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the continental U.S. Haley , however , maintained that \u201c we are not going to run scared from them . \u201d\nU.S. SPY SATELLITES DETECT NORTH KOREA MOVING ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILES TO PATROL BOAT\nThe ambassador , who has made global human rights at the forefront of her positions since starting the job earlier this year , also characterized the chaos in Venezuela as \u201c tragic . \u201d\n\u201c We are watching a democracy go directly into a dictatorship , \u201d Haley said , noting that an emergency hearing on the country in crisis was called two months ago after she proclaimed it a \u201c serious human rights \u201d concern .\nVenezuela has been in a state of conflict for months , with almost daily anti-government protests targeting iron-fisted President Nicolas Maduro have been engulfing through the increasingly impoverished country . The situation has deteriorated even further over the past few days since a controversial constituent assembly was sworn in on 4 August .\n\u201c The Security Council \u2019 s response was that this should go to the Human Rights Council . The reason it hasn \u2019 t gone to the Human Rights Council is because Venezuela is on the Human Rights Council , \u201d she added , indicating that the matter will likely need to return to the Security Council . \u201c We \u2019 re going to continue sanctions , at least from the U.S. side , but we have to be loud about this . \u201d\nHaley said that North Korea is the largest \u201c threat \u201d facing the United States at this point in time , but acknowledged the \u201c lack of stability around the world . \u201d\n\u201c You can \u2019 t take your eye off of any part of the world , \u201d Haley said on Fox & Friends Tuesday . \u201c We are anywhere and everywhere , which is what the United States Does .

''\nMalik was not identified as a threat despite being interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and vetted by five different government agencies that checked her name and picture against a terror watch list and ran her fingerprints against two databases .\n`` This is a case where , in retrospect , we know that this is a person that had lots of red lights and red flags . How come they did n't stand out as a high risk traveler ? That 's a really , really good question , '' Carafano said .\nOver the weekend , dive teams from the FBI and local police finished searching the bottom of a muddy lake three miles from the site where the couple opened fire and killed 14 people . They pulled multiple objects from the water , but it is unknown if they recovered a computer hard drive that Farook and Malik may have discarded in the lake before they were killed in a shootout with police .\nInvestigators hope to search that hard drive for information on potential connections between the couple and foreign terror groups .\nThey also continue to question Enrique Marquez , Farook 's friend who we know purchased the two semi-automatic rifles that were used in the attack . It is likely that Marquez will be charged with something once authorities finish speaking with him , but so far sources tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 he has waived his rights and is being very cooperative .", "Washington ( CNN ) The forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is not just the usual story of an administration racked by chaos and the short shelf life of almost everyone who works for an imperious and grudge-bearing President .\nNielsen was hardly a moderate out of step with President Donald Trump on his signature issue of immigration . She became the administration 's public face of the zero-tolerance policy that caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents .\nBut she is nonetheless paying the price for a crisis exacerbated by the President 's decision-making amid a major surge in migrants crossing the border .\nIt 's a sign of a government stocked with acting secretaries and hampered by thin personnel benches , stretched beyond functionality by Trump 's impulses and the most prodigious staffing burn rate of any modern President .\nNielsen 's ouster fits with a pattern of Trump forcing out officials who have pushed back against his more radical instincts or been unable to carry them out , or who have earned his ire for being unwilling to match his defiance for governing practice and convention . They include former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions , former national security adviser H.R . McMaster and former chief of staff John Kelly .\nYet there is also a more fundamental reason for Nielsen 's departure that gets closer to the heart of Trump 's behavior and political strategy than almost all of the many , previous exits from his administration .\nNielsen 's demise is the clearest indication yet of the impossibility of reconciling Trump 's ideological and emotional instincts on immigration -- which helped make him President -- with legal , humanitarian and international realities .\nNielsen `` believed the situation was becoming untenable '' with Trump `` becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests , '' a senior administration official told CNN 's Jake Tapper on Sunday .\nHer departure mirrors that of former Defense Secretary James Mattis last year , whose authority was shredded by a sudden , and apparently spontaneous announcement of a Syria withdrawal by the President , but who had gradually grown apart from his boss .\nIn both cases , the complexity of serious policy problems , often in life or death situations , clashed with the political instincts of a President who abhors detail and prefers to govern from the gut , while ignoring conventional expertise -- even from subordinates that in no way could be considered moderates .\nAs the crisis on the US-Mexico border worsened , Trump 's tolerance for Nielsen snapped .\nAnd the President might also have gone looking for a scapegoat .\nLast week , he was forced to climb down on a public threat to close the southern border after officials , business groups and political leaders warned of a pending economic disaster if he went ahead .\nHe covered his blushes by going on a tear on immigration , with some of the most unconstrained rhetoric on the issue ever heard by an American president , that was scorching even by the standards of Trump himself .\n`` Ca n't take you anymore . Ca n't take you . Our country is full ... Ca n't take you anymore , I 'm sorry . So turn around . That 's the way it is , '' Trump said in a message to asylum seekers during a trip to the border on Friday .\nA day later , Trump mocked those fleeing persecution seeking a better life in the United States , portraying asylum seekers as criminals and gang members , rather than the families Nielsen described in a CNN interview last week .\n`` ' I am very fearful for my life , ' '' Trump said mockingly during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on Saturday . `` I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home . No , no , he 'll do the accosting ! ''\nJUST WATCHED Secy . Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving , Trump tweets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Secy . Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving , Trump tweets 00:40\nNielsen 's departure , confirmed in a tense White House meeting with Trump on Sunday afternoon , came after days of speculation and was in retrospect a logical consequence of the President 's boiling frustration .\nHe had been dissatisfied with Nielsen for months , though their relationship appeared to improve marginally during the government shutdown that spanned the turn of the year and turned into another political reverse for Trump .\nSpeculation about her status ballooned last week , after Trump suddenly declared that he would halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Honduras , El Salvador and Guatemala , accusing them of sending migrants to the US border .\nThe move utterly undercut Nielsen who had just days before signed what her department called a `` historic , regional compact '' to tackle undocumented migration at its source .\nImmigration experts said that the aid cutoff would ultimately make the situation far worse as it would exacerbate the deprivation and lawlessness in Central America that is a key driver of migration and asylum claims .\nNielsen 's departure comes as more critical moments loom for the administration that are likely to test Trump 's equilibrium at a time when he is already furious about the border situation .\nWhen he was not fulminating about immigration over the weekend , he was lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and Democratic demands that all of his report should be released .\nAttorney General William Barr , caught between an angry President and Democrats in Congress after finding there was no evidence to support election collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-month .\nThe White House is also trying to escape a self-imposed snafu over health care policy after sending confusing signals of whether the President wanted a new bid to replace Obamacare before or after the 2020 election .\nAnd this week , the administration is expected to significantly escalate tensions with Iran by against throwing caution to the wind by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization , a move some in the defense and intelligence communities fear could expose US personnel in the Middle East to reprisals .\nJUST WATCHED Cuomo to DHS Sec : Why 's Trump viewing fencing , not kids ?

MUST WATCH Cuomo to DHS Sec : Why 's Trump viewing fencing , not kids ? 01:32\nAs he seeks to manage the immigration crisis , the President now has a chance to insert a like-minded replacement in what in the wake of Nielsen 's departure looks like an increasingly impossible job .\nTrump has already signaled that he will make immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election bid and has every political incentive , since he is basing his hopes of a second term on energizing his base , to turn up the heat on the issue .\nThe new secretary will also face the same limits as Nielsen . As much as Trump rages against asylum claims , they are codified in US and international laws that he in practice can not just disregard .\nHe recently found out that his preferred , dramatic solution of just closing the border would cause a swift and massive economic backlash that in itself could harm his hopes of winning a second term .\nThe President is already pushing his power to the limit , and possibly beyond it by seeking to use a national emergency declaration to redirect money already allocated by Congress for other projects to the border wall that was at the symbolic center of his 2016 campaign .\nFor all his fiery speeches , it is difficult for Trump to argue that his hardline approach on immigration is actually working .\nAfter years of declines , the tide of asylum seeking and undocumented migrants crossing the border has climbed dramatically .\nThe White House says US Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March -- the most for one month in more than a decade .\nIt argues that Trump has reassigned customs officers to the border and directed them to return as many migrants as possible to Mexico to wait for immigration proceedings on the southern side of the border .\nBut ultimately , there will be no solution to the border problem and the chronic glut in the asylum and court systems , without action by Congress .\nNielsen did `` everything she could to make the problem better , '' a senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN 's Geneva Sands on Sunday .\n`` Worst place for you to be is where you need Congress to act , '' the official said .\nThe White House wants asylum law tightened and the power to detain families traveling with children -- a practice Democrats have branded inhumane .\nTrump named Kevin McAleenan , the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection , as acting replacement for Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security .\nMcAleenan is not seen as an ideologue and served former President Barack Obama -- so there must be considerable doubt about how long he will also be in the post -- but he has less problematic ties with Congress than Nielsen .\nAttempts at reaching a broad political solution on the border have been complicated by Trump 's choice to use immigration as a rallying call for his base and his adoption of rhetoric that stains any political common ground .\nHe has several times pulled out of immigration deals with Democrats that might have helped mitigate the situation at the border apparently because he feared a backlash from his most fervent supporters and cheerleaders in conservative media .\nDemocrats complain that the so-called master of the art of the deal wants to win on all his immigration priorities while offering nothing in return -- for example a path to legal status for people brought to the US illegally and who are protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .\nThey also argue that his rhetoric is incompatible with the founding principles of a nation built on immigration .\n`` When even the most radical voices in the administration are n't radical enough for President Trump , you know he 's completely lost touch with the American people , '' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday , remarking on Nielsen 's departure .\nYet while there is evidence that Trump 's flame throwing commentary on immigration hurt Republicans in swing districts and helped Democrats win the House in midterm elections , Trump 's warning that the US is under assault by marauding caravans of immigrants is widely backed by his supporters .\nThat 's why ultimately , even Nielsen , who was reviled on the left over the family separations policy and attempted to shape the President 's instincts into a workable policy always seemed doomed .\nTrump has shown that he will always , eventually side with the themes and voters that powered his political rise even faced with insurmountable political and practical obstacles .", "Ever since Budapest \u2019 s Keleti train station became the epicenter of Europe \u2019 s migration crisis last fall , Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has led the charge among former communist states of the European Union to reject Muslim refugees in Europe .\nHe sought to shore up that position \u2013 and his role as provocateur to Brussels and its aims to relocate asylum-seekers fairly across the bloc \u2013 in a referendum on Sunday . But while those who voted overwhelmingly rejected the EU \u2019 s redistribution scheme , not enough voters turned out to cast ballots , invalidating the results .\nMr. Orb\u00e1n is trying to spin the referendum as a victory . But the vote also revealed a majority who disagree with him \u2013 either his position on migration or his leadership itself \u2013 or do not believe that the question of migration is sufficiently important to head to polls .\nWhile Hungary is often cast off as simply anti-migrant , the vote shows a nation whose views are far from monolithic , and that will ultimately make it harder for Orb\u00e1n to offer a simplistic message of dissent in Europe .\n\u201c This outcome will make it harder for Orb\u00e1n to stand up for his immigration policy in the EU , because EU leaders can say , \u2018 Orb\u00e1n , now what do you want ? The referendum was invalid , \u2019 \u201d says Attila Tibor Nagy , a political analyst in Budapest at the Center for Fair Political Analysis .\nThat will come as a relief both to the powers in the EU facing an existential crisis after Britain opted to leave the union in June , and amid the rise of right-wing populists , who are peddling an anti-EU message that has gained a deeper foothold during the refugee crisis .\nAmong the most provocative have been the Visegrad countries : Hungary , Poland , Slovakia , and Czech Republic . Leaders have sued the bloc over the mandatory relocation plan . They have said outright that they would take in Christian refugees but not Muslim ones , and butted heads with Brussels and particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel , arguing that migration should be a national , not surpranational , issue .\nOrb\u00e1n led the group when he sealed Hungary \u2019 s southern border and militarized it with police and the Army last year . His referendum campaign explicitly linked the refugee crisis to Europe \u2019 s terrorism threat . \u201c Did you know ? Since the beginning of the migration crisis more than 300 people died in terrorist attacks in Europe , \u201d read one advertisement .\nThe vote required 50 percent turnout in this country of just under 10 million , but only 3.25 million went to the polls . Nonetheless , Orb\u00e1n called it a victory Sunday night , pointing out that more Hungarians voted yesterday than they did in the referendum about joining the EU in 2003 .\nWith almost all votes counted , more than 98 percent rejected the EU plan . `` Thirteen years after a large majority of Hungarians voted at a referendum to join the European Union , today Hungarians made their voices heard again in a European issue , '' Orb\u00e1n said . `` We have achieved an outstanding result , because we have surpassed the outcome of the accession referendum . \u201d\nA counter-campaign by the Two-Tailed Dog Party , a registered political party of street artists that parodies the ruling elite , put up their own spoof posters . \u201c Did you know ? Hungarians see more UFOs in their lifetime than migrants , \u201d read one . Opposition parties urged voters to abstain from the vote . But no party came out supporting the EU \u2019 s relocation plan .\nMr. Nagy says the referendum does not show a turnabout on migration : He sees Hungarian society as decidedly anti-migrant . But he believes voters stayed home because they didn \u2019 t want to contribute to Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s influence as prime minister . They also may have been over-saturated by the campaign blitz .

That is due to many factors , including the EU-Turkey plan to dissuade refugees from coming , as well as the walls Hungary erected . Under the relocation plan , Hungary was only to accept 1,294 asylum-seekers .\n\u201c I can imagine that the vast majority of people could feel that this problem was not so big in their everyday lives , because migration is not seen so directly in Hungary , \u201d Nagy says .", "Most of the illegal immigrant criminals Homeland Security officials released from custody last year were discretionary , meaning the department could have kept them in detention but chose instead to let them onto the streets as their deportation cases moved through the system , according to new numbers from Congress .\nSome of those released were the worst of the worst \u2014 more than 3,700 \u201c Threat Level 1 \u201d criminals , who are deemed the top priority for deportation , were still released out into the community even as they waited for their immigration cases to be heard .\nHomeland Security officials have implied their hands are tied by court rulings in many cases , but the numbers , obtained by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte , showed 57 percent of the criminals released were by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2019 s own choice , and they could have been kept instead .\n\u201c Put aside the spin , and the fact is that over 17,000 of the criminal aliens released last year were released due to ICE discretion , representing 57 percent of the releases , \u201d said Mr. Goodlatte . \u201c The Obama administration \u2019 s lax enforcement policies are reckless and needlessly endanger our communities . \u201d\nIn a statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , ICE said it takes release decisions seriously and makes a judgment in each case . That holds true even for Threat Level 1 criminals .\n\u201c Not all Level 1 criminal aliens are subject to mandatory detention and thus may be eligible for bond , \u201d the agency said , pointing to mitigating circumstances that can convince agents to release the most serious criminals .\n\u201c ICE personnel making custody determinations also take into consideration humanitarian factors such as deteriorated health , advanced age , and caretaking responsibilities . All custody determinations are made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the totality of circumstances in each case , \u201d the agency said .\nICE officials insist that those who are released are still monitored , often by electronic ankle bracelets but also through a system of phone checks or by paying a bond .\nHowever , nearly all of those released under electronic monitoring broke the terms of their release , according to ICE numbers .\nIn fiscal year 2014 , ICE put about 41,000 immigrants through electronic monitoring , and more than 30,000 of them broke the terms of their release \u2014 many of them racking up multiple violations . All told , they notched nearly 300,000 violations in one year alone , or an average of 10 instances per violator .\nThe rate has gone down slightly so far in fiscal year 2015 . Of the 34,002 immigrants put into electronic monitoring , 27,317 have broken the rules a combined 162,322 times .\nICE said violations can include what they deem minor problems , such as someone lacking a strong enough cell signal for voice verification by phone or someone calling in too early or a few minutes late . Low batteries or jostling an electronic bracelet during sports can also cause a monitoring alarm to go off incorrectly , ICE said .\nOf the more than 30,000 detainees who broke the conditional terms of their release and monitoring in 2014 , only 2,420 were deemed to have been serious enough breaches to rearrest them .\nPart of ICE \u2019 s problem is that it doesn \u2019 t have enough beds to go out and pick up violators , according to an inspector general \u2019 s report released earlier this year .\nAgency officials said they would like to be able to hold those who willfully break the rules , but they haven \u2019 t requested more beds . Indeed , Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2016 budget request actually asked for fewer beds to hold detainees next year , arguing that he wants to put more emphasis on the very alternatives that are being violated .\nICE \u2019 s treatment of those awaiting their deportation proceedings has been controversial for several years .\nIn 2013 , the agency released 36,007 convicted criminals who were awaiting the outcome of their deportation cases . Those released had amassed 116 homicide convictions , 15,635 drunken driving convictions and 9,187 convictions stemming from what ICE labeled involvement with \u201c dangerous drugs . \u201d\nThe total dropped to about 30,000 in 2014 \u2014 but the seriousness of the offenses increased , with 193 homicide convictions among the detainees and 16,070 drunken driving convictions . There were also 426 sexual assaults and 303 kidnapping convictions , ICE said .\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and ICE Director Sarah Saldana said the numbers were unacceptable and imposed new rules requiring releases to be vetted by senior agency officials to make sure they were correct .\nBoth Mr. Johnson and Ms. Saldana also said many of the releases are required and give them little discretion \u2014 particularly those made under a 2001 Supreme Court decision known as the Zadvydas case , when the justices ruled that immigrants couldn \u2019 t generally be detained indefinitely .\nThat means that if a home country won \u2019 t take someone back , ICE must release them after about six months .\nBut the new numbers obtained by Mr. Goodlatte suggest Zadvydas-related releases were fewer than 2,500 in 2014 , or only about 8 percent of the total \u2014 compared to the 57 percent that ICE admits were completely discretionary .\nThe rest of the releases were divided between cases where an immigration judge ordered bond or where ICE was unable to obtain travel documents but it wasn \u2019 t considered a mandatory release under the Zadvydas ruling .", "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration , facing criticism for its response to the devastation in Puerto Rico , sent a three-star general to the island Thursday to ramp up relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Maria .\nLt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan , a commander of U.S. Army North , had already been overseeing the effort from San Antonio , the White House said , but is being sent to the U.S. territory to \u201c have his eyes on it and make sure he \u2019 s comfortable with the interaction between his forces , and the governor and the municipal forces , \u201d said White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert .\nAsked why Gen.

We are working for you .

Ricardo Rossello . The 1920 law requires ships carrying cargo between U.S. points be owned and managed by U.S. citizens and have American crews .\nMr. Rossello on Wednesday evening called Mr. Bossert , who said he relayed the request to the president . \u201c He thought that was the right thing to do , and we waived it right away , \u201d Mr. Bossert said .\nA day earlier , the president told reporters he was hesitant to waive the Jones Act because of opposition from the shipping industry .\nMr. Bossert on Thursday pushed back on criticism of the administration \u2019 s relief efforts , calling complaints that the president hadn \u2019 t waived the Jones Act sooner \u201c unfounded \u201d and suggested news media coverage was incorrectly \u201c giving the appearance that the government is not moving fast enough . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing that can happen fast enough \u201d due to the \u201c understandable degree of devastation \u201d in Puerto Rico , Mr. Bossert said .\nEarlier in the day , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) called on the Pentagon to take over relief operations and said the Federal Emergency Management Agency wasn \u2019 t equipped to handle the disaster because the island isn \u2019 t set up like a U.S. state with a well-established disaster-relief network .\n\u201c In a traditional setting you would have the emergency operations officials in a jurisdiction , \u201d Mr. Rubio said . \u201c In the case of Puerto Rico , that \u2019 s not working because those emergency officials have no communication , don \u2019 t have full situational awareness , are already overwhelmed\u2014they just recovered from one storm\u2014and have significant fiscal constraints . \u201d\nThe Pentagon said Thursday that the Defense Department \u201c continues ongoing relief operations \u201d in Puerto Rico with a focus on what the department said are FEMA \u2019 s immediate goals of assessing hospitals there .\nCongress is waiting on the Trump administration to determine how much it will seek in additional disaster relief spending . House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) said he estimates that request will come next month and that \u201c we will quickly act on that request because we need to get help to people who need it . \u201d\nFEMA \u2019 s disaster-relief fund stands at $ 4.6 billion . About $ 900 million so far is obligated for Hurricane Maria relief , according to a congressional aide . FEMA will get an additional $ 7 billion Oct. 1 when the new fiscal year starts .\nBut some lawmakers worry that the administration doesn \u2019 t have enough people on the island to rebuild the infrastructure and speed medical supplies , food and water to communities there .\n\u201c Rather than 5,000 , there should be 50,000 \u201d military personnel there , Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D. , Conn. ) said Thursday on the Senate floor . \u201c Not to enforce martial law , but to make sure that the logistics , the transportation , the means of delivery , the lifeblood of that island in food and fuel and medicine and water and other basic necessities are sufficient to move those basic supplies to places that they are needed . \u201d\nIn Puerto Rico , 47 of 69 hospitals identified for assessment have been checked , with much of the transportation provided by Defense Department helicopters , according to the Pentagon statement .\nAll but one of the island \u2019 s nine airports are open , and of the six FEMA-designated priority ports only one remains closed .\nA dozen National Guard armories are part of a network of more than 100 distribution locations for crucial supplies , including fuel .

But she announced the move on Friday after it began to break in the media , revealing that she has been nominated to lead the California university system .\n`` For more than four years I have had the privilege of serving President Obama and his Administration as the Secretary of Homeland Security , '' she said in a statement . `` The opportunity to work with the dedicated men and women of the Department of Homeland Security , who serve on the frontlines of our nation 's efforts to protect our communities and families from harm , has been the highlight of my professional career . We have worked together to minimize threats of all kinds to the American public . ''\nNapolitano has ridden out a rocky tenure , having endured a string of lawsuits and multiple controversies regarding the agencies that DHS oversees . Among the complaints , Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents accused the department leadership in a lawsuit of failing to properly enforce immigration law . Their complaints center on the practice of using `` prosecutorial discretion '' -- allowing department lawyers to selectively determine which immigrants to pursue for deportation , and which to let go . Her aides claimed it was a matter of prioritizing resources , though some agents claimed it ran afoul of immigration law .\nNapolitano 's department later enacted a Dream Act-style policy giving young illegal immigrants a reprieve .\n`` Secretary Napolitano 's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was defined by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law , '' Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala. , one of her chief critics , said in a statement .\nThe news of her departure apparently caught Napolitano 's staff by surprise , Fox News is told . Officials , though , said the view among many at the department is that Napolitano has been `` out of sight , out of mind '' for a while -- particularly since she declared `` the system worked '' after a terrorist tried , unsuccessfully , to set off a bomb on a Detroit-bound flight in 2009 . She came under criticism for that comment , and again for saying several months later that the attempted bombing in Times Square was merely a `` one-off . ''\nThe secretary had a knack for attracting Republican ire , for times when she appeared to downplay the global terrorist threat . She once , for instance , described terrorism as `` man-caused disasters . ''\nThe agencies within the DHS have also been a popular target of lawmakers . Most recently , the Transportation Security Administration was compelled to back off a policy allowing small knives on planes after intense pushback from Congress .\nAt the same time , Napolitano has been working with other agencies to pump more resources to the border regions to curb illegal immigration , and has been tasked with responding to a series of major natural disasters .\nObama , in a written statement , praised Napolitano for her service .\n`` She 's worked around the clock to respond to natural disasters , from the Joplin tornado to Hurricane Sandy , helping Americans recover and rebuild . Since day one , Janet has led my administration 's effort to secure our borders , deploying a historic number of resources , while also taking steps to make our immigration system fairer and more consistent with our values , '' he said .\nNapolitano , a former Arizona governor , has led the Homeland Security Department since the start of the Obama administration . She is one of the handful of Cabinet members to have stayed with the administration this long .\nThe California university system announced late Friday morning that Napolitano had been nominated for president . She was recommended on a unanimous vote . The Board of Regents will vote next Thursday -- if confirmed , Napolitano will be the first female president of the university .", "Seven months after the military began an investigation into the disappearance of Army Sgt .

He had disappeared from his small patrol base on June 30 , 2009 , under a cloud of suspicion and fear as it became clear he been captured by militants .\nThe Army in June launched a new investigation into Bergdahl \u2019 s disappearance and capture , amid a raft of accusations from his fellow soldiers that he walked away from his unit on the battlefield and questions about whether the Obama administration handled the prisoner swap legally .\nOn Jan. 11 , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Martin Dempsey , said he anticipated a decision `` fairly soon '' on whether the Army would court martial Bergdahl for deserting his post .\n`` In White House terms , not charging Bergdahl means that he was indeed worth the trade for the Taliban Five . But charging him on any level means that releasing the five Taliban was an error of monstrous proportions , one the administration will never be able to explain away satisfactorily , '' said retired Lt. Col. Bill Cowen in a commentary written for the Fox News site .\nFormer Sgt . Matt Vierkant told CNN last year , `` Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war , and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him . ''\n`` I do n't understand , '' Vierkant added , `` why we 're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war , which is an act of treason . ''\nA full 54 percent of Americans agreed in a June 2014 poll , saying Obama \u2019 s swap for Bergdahl amounted to providing aid to terrorists \u2013 which violates federal law . And they said impeachment is deserved .\nIn June , WND reported an explosive charge emerged \u2013 that Bergdahl 's fellow soldiers had orders to shoot him on sight as a deserter .\nA number of damning charges against Bergdahl came from soldiers who served with him . Some were posted on Facebook .\nThe soldiers wrote anonymously , saying the Pentagon had them sign nondisclosure statements after Bergdahl disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 . Some said they were still on active duty .\nWND also reported a four-year-old claim by a Taliban commander that Bergdahl was n't just a deserter but also a traitor who converted to Islam and taught jihadi fighters how to make bombs and ambush convoys .\nAfghan intelligence officials believed Bergdahl was `` cooperating with the Taliban '' and advising fighters at a base in Pakistan .\nA comment posted by a soldier who says he served with Bergdahl confirmed the charge .\n`` What you have is pretty well spot on , '' the post says . `` All I know is that our orders were kill on contact and then we came back and it was covered up . I \u2019 ve personally been threatened a few times that discussing it in half the detail you already have was considered an act of treason . ''\nAnother post made clear the Army considered Berdahl not just a deserter but a defector .\n`` My battalion took over the AO from 25th . The story of Bergdahl being a defector is exactly what was briefed to us and I also read the debrief report about the situation . The story is 100 % correct . I \u2019 ve personally been on a few missions following up on Bergdahls location but we never found anything . I currently live an hour away from his family \u2019 s location . Hailey , Idaho , is a resort town frequented by movie stars etc . They typically side with the anti-war side of politics in that area and is a perfect spot for him to live in solitude . ''\nAnother post that said Bergdahl deserted came from someone who said he was directly involved in the attempted recovery of Bergdahl .\n`` Here is what I know , not from hearsay , but because I was there . Bergdahl became a sympathizer , walked off his post to seek out the Taliban in order to join their ranks , to help and live with them . In exchange for his release , the United States released the following 5 known Taliban ; Khairullah Khairkhwa , Mullah Norullah Noori , Mullah Norullah Noori , Abdul Haq Wasiq , Mohammed Nabi who were immediately welcomed back into the Taliban network . The Taliban are currently seeking the release of additional prisoners , but will not state specifics . Now that they have the blue print on how to accomplish this by simply capturing an American soldier and with the troop number drawing down to 9,800+ , I can only hope our service men and women keep their heads on a swivel . ''", "As the armed forces shrink and withdraw from some global hot spots , their agenda for the battle of the sexes grows .\nThe Pentagon under the Obama administration has devoted considerable hours in public and private to sorting out same-sex relationships , the roles of women in the foxhole and ways to stop sexual assaults . Now , another issue has arisen : gender transformation .\nThe sexual revolution has some traditionalists wondering whether the Pentagon is taking its eye off the ball \u2014 the enemy .\n\u201c Every conceivable form of PC is being enforced upon our hard-pressed military with a zeal that only a Russian army zampolit \u2014 a political officer \u2014 would truly appreciate , \u201d said Ken Allard , a retired Army colonel and commentator . \u201c We are seemingly concerned about everything except the most basic thing : how to fight and win the nation \u2019 s wars . If we have forgotten that constraint , let me assure you that our enemies have not , from the Taliban to the drug cartels to the Iranian Quds Force . \u201d\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel has made stamping out sex abuse a top priority , having met with President Obama , delivered public statements and appointed a board to recommend fixes .\nMeanwhile , the Army , Marine Corps and U.S. Special Operations Command have immersed themselves in surveys and studies to evaluate physical standards for direct ground combat . It \u2019 s a two-year lead-up to putting women in infantry , tank and commando units .\nThe process is time-consuming and daunting . The Pentagon has made it clear that it does not want to retain irrelevant standards that women can not meet \u2014 and it wants women introduced into combat units in sizable numbers to develop mentoring and female camaraderie .\n\u201c Yes , there is too much focus on social issues in the armed forces driven by external proponents with special interests , focused agendas and , in many cases , lack of knowledge about the armed forces , \u201d said retired Gen. Carl Mundy , Marine Corps commandant from 1991 to 1995 . \u201c The military services are without question the most open element in our society , and the very nature of that openness , together with the fishbowl in which they exist , make them ripe and easy targets for activists with an agenda . \u201d\nThe Marines in particular face a challenge in finding enough women , who make up 7 percent of the Corps . Women account for 14 percent of Army soldiers .\nBefore retiring as Marine commandant in 2010 , Gen. James Conway testified before a congressionally created commission on military diversity . He said he doesn \u2019 t believe Marine women want to be in land combat .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think you will see a change because I don \u2019 t think our women want it to change , \u201d Gen. Conway testified . \u201c There are certain demands of officers in a combat arms environment that our women see , recognize , appreciate , and say , \u2018 I couldn \u2019 t do that . In fact , I don \u2019 t want to do that because I don \u2019 t think it best prepares me for success if I am trying to do those things against the male population at lieutenant , captain , major and lieutenant colonel [ ranks ] . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Now that \u2019 s not to say that we don \u2019 t have women doing a tremendous job in combat where you have a pretty amorphous environment , no real front lines in a counterinsurgency environment . And their contributions are appreciated and recognized and rewarded , \u201d the commandant added .\n\u201c In talking to them , I think they feel like that \u2019 s probably enough . So I don \u2019 t see the day coming where we would change our culture necessarily and , in the process , go against what I think the vast majority of our women would want to see \u2014 stay pretty much like it is . \u201d\nSince autumn , six female Marine officers have tried to complete the mandatory combat qualification course . All failed or dropped out because of injuries . The Corps now is attempting to compile a checklist of physical attributes that identifies female officers who can perform direct ground combat . It plans to apply the same inventory to enlisted Marine women .\nThe combat debate was preceded by and now coincides with a running debate on openly serving gays . The Pentagon spent a year preparing every unit for open homosexuals in the ranks . Now it is churning out regulations on gay marriage , authorized leave for same-sex weddings and domestic benefits .\nTold of complaints from combat veterans , a Pentagon spokesman said that , in the case of same-sex marriage , the Defense Department is complying with a Supreme Court decision that struck down most of the federal Defense of Marriage Act , which defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman .\n\u201c The Department of Defense remains committed to ensuring that all men and women who serve our country , and their families , are treated fairly and equally , \u201d the spokesman said . \u201c Expeditious implementation of the decisions announced in Secretary Hagel \u2019 s memorandum will help the Department remain true to its commitment . \u201d\nElaine Donnelly , who runs the Center for Military Readiness , keeps track of the Pentagon \u2019 s sex-related bureaucracy \u2014 and she says it is growing .\nBesides a committee that advises the defense secretary on women \u2019 s issues and a task force devoted to surveying sex-abuse victims , the services themselves are setting up satellite organizations to do the same things .\n\u201c There is also a task force that deals with the service academies alone , \u201d Ms. Donnelly said . \u201c And lots of individual committees set up within each service , which spend countless hours conducting internal meetings and writing reports .\n\u201c Then there are outside contractors such as Rand Corp. , and even entertainers who do shows like \u2018 Sex Signals , \u2019 which include edgy language and scenarios that are inconsistent with standards of professional propriety , \u201d she said .\nNow another social debate is emerging . Army Pvt . Bradley E. Manning , convicted of leaking thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks , wants to undergo a sex change while serving his sentence at a military prison at Fort Leavenworth , Kan . The Army says it does not provide such hormone therapy .\nBut the gay-rights movement , a big supporter of Mr. Obama , has demanded that the military ranks be open to transgenders as well as gays .\nThe social focus has emerged amid a military drawdown and retrenchment . The last combat troops left Iraq in December 2011 , and most are due to leave Afghanistan next year . Mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration are squeezing a force already slated to shrink .\n\u201c It appears to me as if neither the administration nor much of the Congress is focused on military readiness , \u201d said retired Army Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin , a former Delta Force commando and Pentagon intelligence official . \u201c Yet they tell me that I must sacrifice constitutional liberties in the interest of national security .\n\u201c Give that line a rest , because if they care one whit about national security , they would stop the sequestration and social engineering of the most important element of national security . \u201d\nGen. Raymond T. Odierno , Army chief of staff , announced in June that he was eliminating 10 brigade combat teams , with an aim of trimming 80,000 soldiers over four years .\nThe Navy said it lacked the money to send a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf , even though the commander in charge requested it .\nThe Air Force jet fighter inventory has shrunk by more than 500 over the past 10 years to about 2,000 planes as it consolidates units . Retired fighter jocks have taken to calling it a \u201c geriatric Air Force . \u201d\nEven though women have piloted fighter aircraft for nearly 20 years , Air Combat Command is not immune to the social agenda . It conducted sweeping inspections of work and living spaces to root out any digital or hard-copy material deemed offensive to women .\nThe week of Aug. 12 illustrated the Pentagon \u2019 s dual role as war fighter and social engineer : It held a press briefing on the Afghanistan War on Aug. 14 . That same day , it announced policies extending benefits to same-sex spouses of service members .\nThe Pentagon had to work through the circumstance that not all military couples live in states that permit same-sex marriage . The answer : Those personnel will be granted extra leave time to travel to states that allow same-sex weddings .\n\u201c We recognize that same-sex military couples who are not stationed in a jurisdiction that permits same-sex marriage would have to travel to another jurisdiction to marry , \u201d the Pentagon said . \u201c That is why the department will implement policies to allow military personnel in such a relationship non-chargeable leave for the purpose of traveling to a jurisdiction where such a marriage may occur . \u201d\nThe next day , Aug. 15 , top officials briefed the press on sexual assault prevention and response .\nThat afternoon , the Pentagon put out two statements from Mr. Hagel within seconds of each other .\nOne dealt with war \u2014 the secretary \u2019 s call to Egyptian Defense Minister Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as the military cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood . The second : sexual harassment .\n\u201c Eliminating sexual assault from the armed forces remains one of the Defense Department \u2019 s top priorities , \u201d Mr. Hagel said .\nSaid Gen. Mundy : \u201c My greatest concern is the impact on the morale and steadfastness to service among some of the finest and most selfless leaders this nation produces , together with the equally fine young men and women they lead who are barraged with being branded as or tolerating sexual predators or anti-equal opportunity . I can not help but believe that there is long-term impact on the effectiveness of our armed forces from this in terms of morale , recruiting , retention and public confidence and support . \u201d", "I have spent the past 20 or so New Years \u2019 Eves glued to the SyFy channel \u2019 s \u201c Twilight Zone \u201d marathon .

Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States , and mass amnesia has washed over America . Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20 . The former president , Barack Obama , is literally sitting right there . Yet , his own party can not remember one thing about his eight years \u2026 \u201d\nIt is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era \u2014 the memory-holing of Obama \u2019 s executive powers . Democrats continuously act as though they \u2019 ve just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything .\nTrump \u2019 s illegal immigration policies are draconian ! He \u2019 s deporting too many , they screamed , forgetting that \u2026 Obama deported more . A lot more . And , you know those cages on the southern border ? Obama built them , not Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s defying congressional subpoenas ! No president has ever stonewalled Congress , they screamed , forgetting that Obama \u2019 s attorney general , Eric Holder , was held in contempt of Congress for \u2026 defying subpoenas related to the `` Fast and Furious '' gun operation scandal . There were at least eight other times when Obama \u2019 s administration defied congressional oversight , even preventing people from testifying ( sound familiar ? ) .\nMore from Scott Jennings : Which 2020 Democrat can beat Donald Trump ? Do n't bet on Biden , Warren or Sanders .\nWhen Trump announced his \u201c America First \u201d policy during his inaugural , Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can .\nNow , they howl over Trump \u2019 s latest outrage : The airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani , the general who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the U.S. Embassy and , evidently , plotting future hits on American targets .\nWashington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent . This , after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval .\n\u201c When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009 , he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency . By his third year in office , Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned ( at ) Guantanamo Bay , \u201d Newsweek reported .\nObama practically invented modern push-button warfare , for goodness \u2019 sake ! Eventually , the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump \u2019 s perfectly precedented decisions .\nOn Iran , Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren \u2019 t going to take the regime \u2019 s provocations and hostility anymore . Obama sent them pallets of cash . Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper .\nAnyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying . They don \u2019 t . But the commander in chief took out the world \u2019 s most notorious terrorist , one with plenty of American blood on his hands . Trump is the good guy here , not the terrorist .\nYet , Democrats couldn \u2019 t wait to pounce . How many statements included perfunctory \u201c yeah , Soleimani was a bad guy , but \u2026 \u201d construction before hammering Trump ?\nHere \u2019 s a pro tip : If your statement has a \u201c but \u201d in the middle ( I \u2019 m looking at you , Elizabeth Warren ) , just eliminate the throat-clearing , political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean . We get it : Iranian Guy Bad , Orange Man Worse .\nThis attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election . Not just on foreign policy , but across the board ( they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression ) . They just can \u2019 t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is , thanks at least in part to the president \u2019 s decisions .\nIt hasn \u2019 t always been this way . After the death of Osama bin Laden , Republicans praised Obama \u2019 s decision to get him .\n\u201c Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared , \u2018 The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation. \u2019 New York \u2019 s former mayor , Rudolph W. Giuliani , said , \u2018 I admire the courage of the president. \u2019 And Donald J. Trump declared , \u2018 I want to personally congratulate President Obama , \u2019 \u201d according to The New York Times .\nBut no such allowance is given to President Trump when he kills a terrorist . As commentator Guy Benson tweeted , \u201c The U.S. auto industry is alive , and ( Abu Bakr ) Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead , \u201d referencing the Islamic State leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama \u2019 s reelection slogan .\nOr , as Rod Serling might say , \u201c Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson : Past is prologue .

This was their first meeting ? McMaster : Well , there already was too much that 's been leaked from those meetings . And one of the things that I 'm most concerned about is the confidence , the confidentiality of those kind of meetings , as you know , are extremely important . And so , I am really concerned about these kind of leaks , because it undermines everybody 's trust in that kind of an environment where you can have frank , candid , and often times unconventional conversations to try to protect American interests and secure the American people .\nThe answer is : No , Trump didn \u2019 t confront the Russians on interference in our elections .

Maybe it was because of this :\nA classified memo instructs intelligence analysts to keep their daily intelligence briefings with President Donald Trump short , according to Mother Jones . The guidance recommends that analysts limit themselves to three topics , include essential facts that support their findings , and to try to keep their findings to a page . The memo also suggests that conflicting views or information should not be shared with the president in different briefings , according to the report .\nSo , H. R.

The point was to show just how limited in brain development the monkeys really were , because their instincts to touch overcame their instincts to listen to their pain . It really did become comical after a while .\nThat \u2019 s how the Democrats are on impeachment . They just can \u2019 t help themselves .\nAfter months and months and months of listening to the left call for Trump \u2019 s ouster from office \u2014 a call that laughingly began before Trump even took over the White House \u2014 the mantra has become monkeyish .\n\u201c For starters , \u201d wrote CNN \u2019 s digital director of politics , Z. Byron Wolf , there \u2019 s no indication that Trump is anywhere near to being impeached . \u201d\nWell , yeah . There is that . Typically \u2014 and this is just an opinion , from someone who \u2019 s not an attorney \u2014 there must be a crime committed before the charges are affixed .\nThe order of operation goes like this : Crime . Charge . Conviction \u2014 or acquittal . Sadly , the order for Democrats on Trump has been this \u2014 Charge . Move to convict . Now go find the crime .\nAnd thanks to a very , very complicit and biased media , Democrats have been able to move forward with frightening speed on this order . But now they \u2019 ve lost a key asset \u2014 CNN . You know it \u2019 s bad for your leftist side when CNN reports in favor of a Republican .\nThe article of impeachment accuses Trump of interfering with the FBI \u2019 s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , and alleges the president \u201c sought to use his authority to hinder and cause the termination of such investigations . \u201d\nWell , once again , good luck with that fellas . The House , controlled by Republicans , isn \u2019 t likely to pass the article . Democratic leaders , looking ahead to 2018 elections and realizing the crazy Rep. Maxine Waters has brought with her Tourette Syndrome-like call for impeachment , have distanced themselves from such talk \u2014 at least in earshot of the media . And the American people , even those who wouldn \u2019 t consider themselves in the Trump camp , aren \u2019 t at all ready for a Bill Clinton Redeux \u2014 that is , impeachment .\nBack in May , he made it clear from the House floor : \u201c This is where I stand . I will not be moved . The president must be impeached . \u201d\nHe said it \u2014 that was his plan all along . Impeach Trump , facts , evidence and truth be danged . On one hand , it \u2019 s refreshing to see a politician actually honor a promise . On the other , going down in political history as one of the monkeys who couldn \u2019 t stop touching the soccer ball , despite the constant slap-down and sting , is not really all that commendable after all . Here \u2019 s a bit of advice for Democrats pursuing impeachment : Wait for the crime . The wheels of justice generally turn better that way .", "Deputy general Rod Rosenstein also authorized investigation of former Trump campaign chair \u2019 s financial dealings in Ukraine\nThe deputy attorney general , Rod Rosenstein , explicitly authorized special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate allegations that the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort colluded with the Russian government , according to a court filing made late on Monday night .\nMueller \u2019 s prosecutors included that detail in a memo defending the scope of their investigation , which so far has resulted in criminal charges against 19 people and three Russian companies .\nManafort , who led the Trump campaign for several months in 2016 , is one of four aides charged in the Mueller investigation . Former national security adviser Michael Flynn , Manafort \u2019 s deputy , Rick Gates , and the foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos have entered plea deals .\nManafort has challenged Mueller \u2019 s authority and asked a judge to dismiss an indictment charging him with crimes including money laundering conspiracy and false statements .\nHe said Mueller , who was assigned to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign , overstepped his bounds by charging him for conduct that occurred years before the 2016 election .\nBut in their new filing , prosecutors revealed that Rosenstein \u2013 who appointed Mueller after the attorney general , Jeff Sessions , recused himself , over contacts with Russians during the election campaign \u2013 wrote a memo last August that outlined the scope of Mueller \u2019 s appointment .\nThe memo , which remains redacted in parts , said that Mueller was empowered to investigate allegations that Manafort \u201c committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials \u201d to interfere with the presidential election .\nNone of the charges Manafort faces alleges coordination with the Kremlin , and Manafort \u2019 s attorneys had used that point to argue that Mueller exceeded his authority by accusing him of financial crimes and acting as an unregistered foreign agent on behalf of Ukrainian interests .\nBut Monday \u2019 s filing appears to undercut that argument . In addition to authorizing the Russia collusion investigation of Manafort , Rosenstein also authorized Mueller to investigate any crimes related to payments Manafort received from the Ukrainian government under former president Viktor Yanukovych .\nFBI questions Ted Malloch , Trump campaign figure and Farage ally Read more\nThe description largely outlines the charges against Manafort , which mostly relate to allegations he conspired to launder tens of millions of dollars received from Ukrainian political consulting including his work on Yanukovych \u2019 s behalf . Manafort has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing related to Russian election interference .\nProsecutors say in their court filing that given their mandate to investigate links between Trump associates and Russia , it was appropriate to investigate Manafort for ties to Russia-backed politicians and oligarchs .\n\u201c It would also naturally look into any interactions they may have had before and during the campaign to plumb motives and opportunities to coordinate and to expose possible channels for surreptitious communications , \u201d they wrote . \u201c And prosecutors would naturally follow the money trail from Manafort \u2019 s Ukrainian consulting activities . \u201d", "On Tuesday , Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced the state of Missouri was filing a lawsuit against the Chinese government , Chinese Communist Party , and other Chinese officials and institutions for the actions they took that triggered deaths and economic chaos across Missouri . In the lawsuit , Schmitt writes bluntly , \u201c This COVID-19 pandemic is the direct result of a sinister campaign of malfeasance and deception carried out by Defendants . \u201d\nCiting Alfred L. Snapp & Son , Inc. v. Puerto Rico , Schmitt pointed out the legitimacy of his lawsuit : \u201c As a sovereign State , Missouri has \u2018 a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and well-being\u2014both physical and economic\u2014of its residents in general. \u2019 \u2026 A state like Missouri , through its Attorney General , may act as \u2018 a representative of the public \u2019 in \u2018 complaining of a wrong which , if proven , limits the opportunities of her people [ and ] shackles her industries . \u2019 \u201d\nHe also explained why the Chinese Communist Party was not immune from prosecution :\nDefendant People \u2019 s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d or \u201c China \u201d ) is a communist nation in Asia . Defendant Communist Party of China ( \u201c CPC \u201d or \u201c Communist Party \u201d ) is the sole governing party within China , and the Communist Party \u2019 s General Secretary becomes the president of the PRC . On information and belief , the Communist Party is not an organ or political subdivision of the PRC , nor is it owned by the PRC or a political subdivision of the PRC , and thus it is not protected by sovereign immunity .\nCOVID-19 has done irreparable damage to countries across the globe , causing sickness , death , economic disruption , and human suffering . In Missouri , the impact of the virus is very real \u2014 thousands have been infected and many have died , families have been separated from dying loved ones , small businesses are shuttering their doors , and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table . The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19 , silenced whistleblowers , and did little to stop the spread of the disease . They must be held accountable for their actions .\nAn appalling campaign of deceit , concealment , misfeasance , and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic . During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak , Chinese authorities deceived the public , suppressed crucial information , arrested whistleblowers , denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence , destroyed critical medical research , permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus , and even hoarded personal protective equipment ( \u201c PPE \u201d ) \u2014thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable .\nThe lawsuit continues with more regarding the efforts by the Chinese government to suppress information regarding the coronavirus :\nWhen their actions began to kill hundreds of thousands of people across the globe , Defendants sought to minimize the consequences , engaging in a coverup and misleading public relations campaign by censoring scientists , ordering the destruction and suppression of valuable research , and refusing cooperation with the global community , all in violation of international health standards .\nSchmitt also noted that the Chinese government did not act to stop the spread of the virus soon enough :\nWhile denying human-to-human transmission , Chinese officials took little to no steps to contain the outbreak . By January 13 , the Chinese government was aware of spread to Thailand . For the next week , they began treating COVID-19 as a serious and contagious virus without advising the public . During that time , millions of people traveled through Wuhan , and many thousands were infected , making a worldwide outbreak almost inevitable . A potluck event for 40,000 people went forward in Wuhan on January 16 . The Chinese government took no serious steps to contain the outbreak until January 23 \u2014when it was far too late .\nFurther , \u201c According to data gathered by The New York Times , nearly 175,000 individuals left Wuhan on January 1 alone to travel for the Lunar New Year . The Chinese government also continued with New Year celebrations , despite the risk for potential further infections . \u201d\nPJ Media noted , \u201c According to unpublished , unconfirmed Chinese government reports seen by the South China Morning Post , the first recorded case of the coronavirus dates to November 17 , 2019 , weeks before The Lancet \u2018 s claim that the first recorded case came on December 1 . By December 8 , the SCMP documents recorded between 1 and 5 new cases . By December 27 , the SCMP documents showed 181 confirmed cases , and a friend of coronavirus whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang recalled that his medical department first reported the new outbreak to the Wuhan Center for Disease Control on the 27th . \u201d", "A $ 100,000 real-estate brokerage fee that was part of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen \u2019 s guilty plea Tuesday came from representing a company owned by a member of the Qatar royal family , according to interviews and real-estate documents .\nMr. Cohen admitted to failing to pay taxes on more than $ 4 million in income , among other felonies . That income included what prosecutors described as $ 100,000 in 2014 from \u201c brokering the sale of a piece of property in a private aviation community in Ocala , Florida . \u201d\nThe community is a fly-in development named Jumbolair , said Frank Merschman , who owns the development . Mr. Merschman said he bought some property in 2014 from a Qatari company , and Mr. Cohen represented the seller , Abdul Aziz Althani Holdings Inc .\nThat company is owned by a member of the Qatar royal family , Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani , 62 years old , according to the Panama Papers , documents from a Panamanian law firm obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung , and shared with The Wall Street Journal .\nSheikh Abdul Aziz and his attorneys didn \u2019 t respond to requests for comment . He was described in the Panama Papers as a major shareholder in two Qatari banks .\nLanny Davis , an attorney for Mr. Cohen , didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment .\nThe Journal reported in May that Mr. Cohen helped a major donor to President Trump \u2019 s inauguration pitch a nuclear-power investment to the Qatari sovereign-wealth fund . The pitch came in early April , shortly before federal authorities raided Mr. Cohen \u2019 s office , apartment and hotel room .\nMr. Merschman said the Qatari company owned several properties adjacent to Jumbolair , and he initially bought one through a tax-foreclosure auction . He said he then received a call from Mr. Cohen , who said the owner , being in Qatar , hadn \u2019 t realized taxes were overdue and wanted to repurchase the property .\nWhen Mr. Merschman declined that offer , he said , Mr. Cohen later offered to sell him two other properties owned by the Qatari company . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how they knew each other , but [ Mr. Cohen ] knew all the people , \u201d Mr. Merschman said . \u201c He had done work for Mr. Aziz . \u201d\nIn 2005 , Abdul Aziz Althani Holdings paid Mr. Trump \u2019 s company $ 6.2 million for a fourth-floor condominium in Trump Park Avenue , New York property records show . Mr. Cohen owns a condo on the 10th floor of that building .\nMr. Merschman \u2019 s company in May 2014 paid $ 650,000 for the two additional properties , county real-estate records show . Mr. Merschman said he didn \u2019 t pay Mr. Cohen \u2019 s brokerage fee directly , but understands the fee was paid through a former owner of the property who was working for him at the time .\nMr. Merschman said the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed him a few months ago about the transaction , and \u201c I cooperated with them 100 % . \u201d", "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump said he has put off the decision about whether to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions , a frequent target of his ire , until at least after the November congressional elections .\n\u201c I just would love to have him do a great job , \u201d Mr. Trump said about Mr . Sessions on Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg News . Mr. Trump declined to say whether he \u2019 d keep Mr . Sessions on the job beyond November .\nMr. Trump has publicly criticized Mr . Sessions for months , and recently told one Republican lawmaker that he wanted to fire him before the midterm elections , according to a person familiar with the matter . But top Republican lawmakers have urged Mr . Sessions to resist pressure to quit and have pushed Mr. Trump to stand down for now .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s statement on Mr . Sessions came after the president surveyed advisers earlier this week about the potential political blowback from firing Mr . Sessions , telling one person that he didn \u2019 t believe there would be much , according to a person familiar with the matter . Inside the White House , senior officials gave Mr. Trump legal and political reasons for not removing Mr . Sessions , but those advisers weren \u2019 t sure earlier this week what Mr. Trump would ultimately decide .\nOne factor for Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision to keep Mr . Sessions for the coming months is that there is no obvious replacement . White House officials and others Mr. Trump has spoken to about firing Mr . Sessions said the president has not inquired about potential successors , these people said .\nFueling Mr. Trump \u2019 s anger is his view that Mr . Sessions erred in recusing himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections , White House aides have said . That investigation is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , as well as possible obstruction of justice . Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has called the probe a \u201c witch hunt. \u201d Russia also has denied any involvement .\nLast week , President Trump issued the latest in a series of attacks on Mr . Sessions , suggesting that Mr . Sessions is allowing the special counsel \u2019 s Russia investigation to proceed while permitting \u201c real corruption \u201d to go \u201c untouched . \u201d\nIn response , Mr . Sessions issued a rare public statement defending his leadership of the Justice Department . \u201c While I am attorney general , the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations , \u201d he said .\nThe tweets put renewed pressure on Mr . Sessions , who is in the delicate position of both fending off attacks from Mr. Trump while carrying out the president \u2019 s tough-on-crime policies .", "( CNN ) A highly unusual and racially charged episode from the 2016 campaign suddenly resurfaced this week when a federal judge whom President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized was assigned to hear the case of a man who claims he was improperly deported .\nJudge Gonzalo Curiel , who was born in the US but is of Mexican heritage , was attacked by Trump last year over his handling of a lawsuit against Trump University . Trump claimed Curiel could not impartially hear the case because of his background and Trump 's hardline immigration policies . The case was eventually settled .\nNow , Curiel is assigned to hear the case of Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez , 23 , who his lawyers allege was deported from California to Mexico earlier this year despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , also known as DACA .\nAnd Trump 's comments toward Curiel last year -- he called the Indiana-born judge a `` hater '' and a `` Mexican '' -- drew some of the loudest accusations of racism that the then-candidate faced during his campaign and several repudiations from prominent Republicans .\nThe lawsuit , which is brought under the Freedom of Information Act , has already become a flashpoint in the Trump administration 's immigration policy and the President 's murky position on DACA .\nCuriel 's involvement is sure to increase the publicity surrounding the case , which is already shaping up to be one of the more high-profile challenges to execution of Trump 's immigration agenda . The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the President feels Curiel will be a fair judge in the matter .\nThe President 's own position on DACA has evolved . Trump pledged to end DACA during the 2016 campaign , but the Department of Homeland Security has continued issuing permits and he has since spoken about how sympathetic he finds the people in DACA -- undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children who , in many cases , know no other home .\n`` We 're going to show great heart , '' Trump said at a news conference in February . `` DACA is a very , very difficult subject for me , I will tell you . ''\nBut he also spoke of possible abuses of the DACA program in the same thought , saying in `` some of the cases , having DACA and they 're gang members and they 're drug dealers , too . But you have some absolutely , incredible kids , I would say mostly . They were brought here in such a way -- it 's a very -- it 's a very , very tough subject . ''\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly has insisted the administration has not detained or deported anyone with an active DACA status , but several former DACA recipients have been detained and , in some cases like Montes ' , the government has maintained that a violation of the program forfeited the status .\nLawyers for Montes say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18 . DHS said Wednesday that never happened .\nWhile DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes ' DACA status expiring in 2015 , they released further information Wednesday saying he did , in fact , have DACA status until 2018 , agreeing with lawyers for Montes .\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump 's full CNN interview with Jake Tapper Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump 's full CNN interview with Jake Tapper 07:20\nThe problem , though , is on the part of the story both sides agree on : Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol . DACA requires individuals to get pre-clearance to leave the country , and so Montes ' re-entry then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status , DHS said . He was sent back to Mexico the following day , where he is now staying .\nThe administration has said that it respects DACA and that no one with active status would be deported , but advocates are using the Montes case and others to call into question whether DHS is being honest about its position .\nThe lawsuit is seeking records about Montes ' interactions with Customs and Border Patrol , and also any appropriate relief for Montes including attorney fees .\nTrump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike last year after he criticized Curiel 's rulings in the Trump University case and attacked Curiel personally .\nOne of Trump 's harshest rebukes came from House Speaker Paul Ryan , who described the language as `` sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment . '' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Trump 's remarks `` offensive and wrong '' and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a staunch ally of Trump , called the comments `` inexcusable '' and `` one of the worst mistakes Trump has made . ''\nTrump later defended himself in a written statement , saying he did not believe `` one 's heritage ( made ) them incapable of being impartial . ''\n`` Based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case , I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial , '' Trump said . He also referenced `` the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration , jobs and unfair trade '' in explaining his criticism .\nIn a memorable exchange with CNN 's Jake Tapper in June , Trump vociferously -- and repeatedly -- defended his claims that Curiel was biased .\n`` He 's proud of his heritage . I respect him for that , '' Trump said , dismissing charges that his allegation was racist . `` He 's a Mexican . We 're building a wall between here and Mexico . ''\nAt the end of a lengthy exchange , Tapper asked : `` If you are saying he can not do his job because of his race , is that not the definition of racism ? ''", "He even suggested that the threat was not real or was exaggerated by putting the word \u201c bomb \u201d in quotes \u2014 language that edged close to that of conspiracy theorists on the alt-right , who claimed without evidence that it was a false flag operation by Democrats to mobilize their voters .\n\u201c Republicans are doing so well in early voting , and at the polls , and now this \u2018 Bomb \u2019 stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics , \u201d the president said in a tweet . \u201c Very unfortunate , what is going on . Republicans , go out and vote ! \u201d\nIt was not clear how much he knew about the case before he posted this tweet , but he had received briefings throughout the week .\nMr. Trump has never troubled himself with keeping a presidential mien during times of national crisis , whether it was wildfires in California , shootings in Chicago or the racial clashes in Charlottesville , Va . But even by his standards , his remarks in the White House before a crowd of a few hundred mostly African-American activists were discordant .\nIn the same week that bombs were mailed to a former Democratic president , a vice president , a first lady , a senator and a congresswoman , Mr. Trump ridiculed the Democratic Party , saying its policies had led to unsafe communities , failing schools and overcrowded prisons . He even claimed erroneously that the party \u2019 s name was \u201c Democrat , \u201d adding , \u201c I hate it . I hate just saying it . \u201d\nIn the same week that a bomb was mailed to the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros , the philanthropist and Democratic donor \u2014 also the same week that Hungary \u2019 s increasingly authoritarian government expelled a university founded by Mr. Soros \u2014 Mr. Trump inveighed against \u201c globalists , \u201d whom he accused of cheating American workers .\nAnd in the same week that two explosives were mailed to CNN \u2019 s New York offices \u2014 one addressed to John O. Brennan , the former C.I.A . director ; the other to James R. Clapper , the former director of national intelligence \u2014 Mr. Trump said the news media attacked him relentlessly and never covered his successes .", "WASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used the `` F-word '' and other expletives after a testy interview with a National Public Radio host on Friday , the news outlet said .\nPompeo unloaded on NPR 's Mary Louise Kelly after an interview in which she questioned him on Ukraine and Iran , among other issues . He grew extremely irritated by Kelly 's Ukraine questions , according to NPR .\n`` 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine ?

He suggested that Kelly had agreed to keep Friday 's post-interview conversation off the record .\n`` It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency , '' Pompeo said . `` This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration .

'' The Eastern European country is at war with Russia .\nIn the impeachment proceedings , House Democrats have charged Trump with abuse of power for soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election , one of two articles of impeachment currently being tried in the Senate . Trump pressed Zelensky to open two investigations that would have helped his re-election campaign . As part of that pressure campaign , Trump ousted former U.S . Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch , a career foreign service diplomat .\nYovanovitch was targeted by Trump 's personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , and Trump has publicly attacked her .\n`` Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology ? '' Kelly asked Pompeo , who has declined to publicly defend the diplomat .\n`` You know , I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran , '' he responded .\nKelly pressed him . `` I just want to give you another opportunity to answer this , because as you know , people who work for you in your department , people who have resigned from this department under your leadership , saying you should stand up for the diplomats who work here , '' she said .\nPompeo said he had defended `` every State Department official , '' to which Kelly said : `` Sir , respectfully where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch ?

There \u2019 s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer \u2019 s campaign as compensation for their backing .\nBut the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House . Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer \u2019 s campaign would think he could purchase their support .\nTom Courtney , a former Democratic state senator from southeastern Iowa who \u2019 s running for reelection to his old seat , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the financial offer \u201c left a bad taste in my mouth . \u201d\nMurphy said concerns about his outreach were the result of a \u201c miscommunication . \u201d\nAs Steyer met with voters in Bluffton , South Carolina , on Thursday , the first question posed to him was about the AP report . He said that he learned about the allegations while driving to the event and that no payments had gone to officials in Iowa .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t given any money to anyone in Iowa , nor are we planning to , \u201d he said . \u201c There \u2019 s no way we would ever do that . \u201d\nCourtney declined to name Murphy as the Steyer aide who made the offer , but several other local politicians said they received similar propositions , and all confirmed the proposal came from Murphy himself .

He said , \u2018 You help them , and they \u2019 ll help you . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c I said , \u2018 It wouldn \u2019 t matter if you \u2019 re talking monetary , there \u2019 s no amount , \u2019 \u201d Courtney continued . \u201c I don \u2019 t do that kind of thing . \u201d\nAlberto Lammers , Steyer \u2019 s campaign press secretary , said the candidate hasn \u2019 t made any individual contributions to local officials in Iowa and won \u2019 t be making any this year . In an email , Lammers said Steyer \u2019 s endorsements \u201c are earned because of Tom \u2019 s campaign message , \u201d and distanced the candidate from Murphy .\n\u201c Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity , and anyone who does is not speaking for the campaign or does not know our policy , \u201d Lammers said .\nIn a separate statement , Murphy said that \u201c as a former legislator , I know how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa . It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable , and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part . \u201d\nThe overtures do not appear to have made much of a difference for Steyer . Aside from Murphy \u2019 s support , Steyer has received the endorsement of just one Iowan since entering the race in July \u2014 former state Rep. Roger Thomas .\nThomas did not respond to phone calls , but in a statement provided by the campaign , he said that he endorsed Steyer \u201c because he \u2019 s the outsider who can deliver for Iowans on the issues that matter most : getting corporate corruption out of our politics and putting forth a rural agenda that revitalizes communities across Iowa . \u201d\nThomas \u2019 endorsement was issued in October after the close of the most recent campaign finance reporting period , which ended Sept. 30 . The disclosure Steyer filed offers no indication that he directly gave Thomas any money .\nExperts say a campaign could violate campaign finance laws if they don \u2019 t disclose payments for endorsements .\n\u201c It \u2019 s legal if you disclose a payment for an endorsement on your campaign finance report , \u201d said Adav Noti , a former Federal Election Commission attorney who now works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington . But , he added , \u201c It would be unlawful if you don \u2019 t disclose it , or you disclose it but try to hide who the recipient is , or try to hide what that purpose was . \u201d\nA trio of former Ron Paul aides faced legal trouble in 2016 over similar issues during the 2012 Iowa Republican caucus campaign . Campaign chairman Jesse Benton , campaign manager John Tate and deputy campaign manager Dimitri Kesari were convicted in 2016 of charges related to arranging and concealing payments for then-Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson , who switched his support from Michele Bachmann to Paul just six days before the Iowa caucuses . Sorenson served 15 months in jail for his role in the scheme .\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether Murphy could face a similar legal complaint , but the issue could revive scrutiny of how Steyer is deploying his financial resources . The billionaire businessman built his fortune in banking and investment management before turning to politics , and though he \u2019 s never held public office , he invested tens of millions of dollars in political activism and electoral politics before launching his presidential bid this year . Before his presidential run , Steyer \u2019 s most recent focus was a multimillion-dollar , pro-impeachment campaign , and as the U.S. House takes up the issue , he \u2019 s argued he \u2019 s put it on the national agenda .\nSteyer has largely self-funded his presidential campaign , spending $ 47.6 million of his own money in the first three months since launching his bid , much of that on online fundraising and advertising . Steyer has qualified for the November debate , but he remains at the back of the pack in early-state and national polls .\nSteve Bullock , who as Montana \u2019 s governor and attorney general spent years pushing for stricter regulation of money in politics , was quick to criticize Steyer , saying an attempt to buy endorsements undermines the democratic process .\n\u201c Tom Steyer \u2019 s campaign is built on writing the biggest checks , not on building genuine grassroots support - and proves why it \u2019 s so important to get Big Money out of our elections , \u201d Bullock , who is also running for president , said in a statement .\nIt \u2019 s not the first time Bullock , who has failed to meet the donor and polling thresholds for most of the Democratic debates , has slammed Steyer . In September , he accused the wealthy philanthropist of bankrolling his way onto the debate stage after spending $ 12 million on advertising in his first six weeks as a candidate .", "After his round of golf on Saturday , it seems the president went back home and started scrolling Twitter . President Donald Trump then proceeded to go on a spree that was bizarre even for his standards as he retweeted posts mocking several big-name female Democrats all while he peddled baseless conspiracy theories regarding MSNBC \u2019 s Joe Scarborough . In one particularly shocking message , the president shared a tweet by John Stahl , a conservative who got a whopping 4 percent in the 2012 open primary to represent California \u2019 s 52nd District , that called Hillary Clinton a \u201c skank . \u201d\nThe president just retweeted someone calling the first woman nominee of either major political party in the US \u201c a skank \u201d a few hours after another Scarborough murder allegation on the weekend the country closes in on 100K coronavirus deaths . pic.twitter.com/5H2E63kWOn \u2014 Maggie Haberman ( @ maggieNYT ) May 24 , 2020\nThat wasn \u2019 t the only time Trump amplified Stahl on Saturday . The president also retweeted two other messages by Stahl in which he insulted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and mocked the way she looks . And he also shared yet another Stahl post in which he made fun of Stacey Abrams \u2019 weight .\nThe president called one prominent female Democrat fat and another a `` skank '' tonight and it wo n't get nearly the coverage of Joe Biden saying something dumb because the bar for Trump is subterranean and we 've normalized having an ignorant monster as president \u2014 Aaron Rupar ( @ atrupar ) May 24 , 2020\nThe president shared the mocking tweets on the same day as he continued to push a conspiracy theory that suggests Scarborough may have had something to do with the 2001 death of an intern who worked for him . \u201c Keep digging , \u201d Trump wrote , \u201c use forensic geniuses ! \u201d This isn \u2019 t the first time the president has peddled that particular theory and it \u2019 s unclear what exactly set him off this time . But earlier in the day , the Morning Joe Twitter account noted there would be a \u201c special Sunday morning edition \u201d of the show \u201c as the New York Times Dedicates Page One to All Those Who Have Lost Their Lives in the Pandemic . \u201d\nA blow to her head ?

If we can light up a neighborhood\u2014we can light a city . If we can light up a city\u2014we can light up our country . ''\nA number of Twitter users compared it to a tweet from Obama in 2012 , where the president wrote : `` One voice can change a room . And if it can change a room , it can change a city . And if it can change a city , it can change a state . ''\n`` The View '' co-host Meghan McCain replied , `` Oh COME ON ! I know Pete thinks he 's the next Obama but this is ridiculous . ''\nThe Buttigieg campaign told Fox News his tweet was in reference to an event earlier on the campaign trail where the lights went out and attendees used their cellphones as lights .\nParkland survivor and conservative activist Kyle Kashuv on Monday night accused Buttigieg of making a habit of mimicking Obama and further claimed the presidential candidate was plagiarizing while sharing a mash-up of similarities between Buttigieg and Obama 's speeches .\nKashuv tweeted a video made by The Recount with the message , `` So it turns out Pete Buttigieg is just blatantly plagiarizing Barack Obama . Cmon man at least come up [ with ] your own platitudes ... ''\nLiberals noticed a pattern , too .

Later , in an unexpected move , Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that the government was resigning to help facilitate the changes .\nRussian government sources told the BBC that ministers did not know about the government 's resignation ahead of the announcement .\nThe Russian leader said during a speech to both chambers of parliament that there would be a nationwide vote on changes that would shift power from the presidency to parliament .\nConstitutional reforms included giving the lower house of parliament , the State Duma , `` greater responsibility '' for the appointment of the prime minister and the cabinet .\nCurrently , the president appoints the prime minister , and the Duma approves the decision .\nMr Putin also suggested an increased role for an advisory body called the State Council . The council , which is currently chaired by Mr Putin , comprises the heads of Russia 's federal regions . Mr Putin said it had proved to be `` highly effective '' .\nAmending the rules that limit presidents to two consecutive terms\nStrengthening laws that prohibit presidential candidates who have held foreign citizenship or foreign residency permits\nMr Medvedev made his announcement on state television with President Putin sitting next to him .\n`` These changes , when they are adopted ... will introduce substantial changes not only to an entire range of articles of the constitution , but also to the entire balance of power , the power of the executive , the power of the legislature , the power of judiciary , '' Mr Medvedev said of Mr Putin 's proposals .\n`` In this context ... the government in its current form has resigned . ''\nMr Putin thanked Mr Medvedev for his work but said `` not everything '' had been accomplished .\nHe asked Mr Medvedev to become deputy head of the National Security Council , which is chaired by Mr Putin .\nThe president later nominated tax service chief Mikhail Mishustin to replace Mr Medvedev as prime minister .\nMr Medvedev has been prime minister for several years . He previously served as president from 2008-2012 , switching roles with Mr Putin - a close ally - after the latter served his first two terms as president . Russia 's constitution only allows presidents to serve two consecutive terms .\nEven when he was prime minister , Mr Putin was widely seen as the power behind then President Medvedev .\nOpposition leader and leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he believed that any referendum on the constitutional changes would be `` fraudulent crap '' . He said Mr Putin 's goal was to be `` sole leader for life '' .\nThe last time Russia held a referendum was in 1993 when it adopted the constitution under President Boris Yeltsin , Mr Putin 's predecessor .\nMr Putin became acting president following Mr Yeltsin 's resignation in 1999 and was formally inaugurated a year later . He has held the reins of power - as president or prime minister - ever since .\nPresident Putin likes stability . It 's his thing . So the newsflash that the entire government had resigned was a big surprise . From the online chatter , it seems even the cabinet ministers did n't see it coming . For a moment it was like a flashback to Russia of the 1990s , when President Yeltsin changed prime ministers as readily as his socks . Vladimir Putin is no Yeltsin , though , and this move looks like part of some bigger plan that 's all about consolidating - and extending - his hold on power .\nUnder the current rules , Mr Putin must step down as president in 2024 and it 's never been clear what he 'd do next . That 's still true . But the constitutional tweaks he 's proposed are hints at some options . He 's bumped up the status of the little-known State Council , which he already heads . Or he could become PM again , now he 's slightly weakened the powers of Russia 's president .\nIf he is sticking around , perhaps he needs to make that palatable to people given all the social and economic problems he had to list once again in his annual address to the nation . If Mr Putin were to blame for their woes , Russians might well wonder why they should swallow him staying on , post-2024 . Dmitry Medvedev - so often useful to Mr Putin - for now looks like a handy scapegoat .\nIn his address to parliament , the president unveiled a series of plans to increase the number of children being born in Russia . Like several Eastern European states , Russia has been struggling with a declining birth rate .\nLast year Mr Putin promised tax breaks for bigger families .\nOn Wednesday he pledged state funding for new mothers in a bid to increase the number of children being born from an average of fewer than 1.5 per woman to 1.7 within four years .\nSo-called `` maternity capital '' has until now only been paid to families with at least two children .\nWelfare benefits will also be paid for children aged three to seven in low-income families , and free school meals will be provided for the first four years of school .\nRussia 's population has struggled to recover from a dramatic decline in the 1990s .", "Police in Moscow arrested more than 750 people during a demonstration outside city hall on Saturday , where they were calling for fair elections after the upcoming city council elections on Sept. 8 excluded opposition candidates from being on the ballot , according to a Russian organization that monitors political arrests .\nOVD-Info said 779 people were detained .

He remains happy to engage with members on their questions regarding the Mueller report . \u201d\nBarr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House panel on Thursday . The GOP-led Senate committee is expected to have normal rounds of member questioning .\nIt is unusual for committee counsels to question a witness . But committees can generally make their own rules , and other panels have made similar exceptions . In a confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year , for example , Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee hired an outside prosecutor to question a witness who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault .\nThe dispute comes as tensions have escalated sharply between House Democrats and the Trump administration over full access Mueller \u2019 s report and government witnesses who have defied congressional subpoenas to testify . Democrats have been eagerly anticipating the hearing with Barr as they try to build on Mueller \u2019 s findings with their own investigations into the president .\nHouse Democrats have subpoenaed the Justice Department for the unredacted version of the Mueller report and underlying material gathered from the investigation . In response , the Justice Department has said they will make the full report , minus grand jury material , available to a limited group of members \u2014 an offer that Democrats have so far refused . The dispute could eventually end up in court .\nA spokeswoman for the top Republican on the committee , Rep.

In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election , Russian trolls used disinformation campaigns to sow discord . Experts are now seeing similar activity heading into the 2018 midterms . \u201c The trolls are trying to improve their tactics . They \u2019 re trying to get better at hiding their traces . So it \u2019 s going to be a game of cat and mouse. \u201d Ben Nimmo is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council \u2019 s Digital Forensic Research Lab . He works to identify and analyze online disinformation . \u201c The way these accounts work has always been a combination of infiltration and radicalization. \u201d He walked us through some of the imagery and strategies used by notorious online trolls from Russia and , perhaps , elsewhere . First , they pick a hot-button issue . \u201c There are certain very high-profile problems that American society has , which are well-known abroad . And it tended to be those ones which are targeted . So the original troll factory accounts were very heavily engaged in the debate on gun control and the Second Amendment , on women \u2019 s rights and abortion rights . They were heavily engaged on Black Lives Matter. \u201d A slew of inauthentic accounts that Facebook recently deleted took the same approach , updated to fit the latest top news . They use identity politics and emotion to appeal to followers . Next step , tap into a community . \u201c So you start off by making positive comments about the target group . Let \u2019 s say you want to masquerade as a Black Lives Matter supporter . You start by making lots of positive comments about the African-American community . You talk about how beautiful the girls are . You talk about their glorious cultural history and you try and engage with real activists who are busy on this subject. \u201d Now it \u2019 s time to ramp it up . \u201c Once you \u2019 ve established your credentials , you start slipping more and more toxic content into the mix . So , rather than saying positive things about your community , you start saying negative things about other communities . The war against colonialism is a theme that comes up on this page time and again . It \u2019 s a hint at violence . And last , they try to move from the online world into real life . \u201c And then maybe you slip into the mix a suggestion : \u2018 Let \u2019 s have a protest . Let \u2019 s get real people out on the streets. \u2019 And then , because you \u2019 re operating probably from some time zones away , you need to think , \u2018 Well , how do we get this to happen ? \u2019 And you start trying to reach out to genuine local organizations . Maybe you say , \u2019 Well , we can \u2019 t turn up on that day because we \u2019 ve got something else going on . Why don \u2019 t you organize this for us ? \u2019 \u201d In 2016 , Russian trolls organized political events for and against both presidential candidates . At an Islamic center in Houston , they organized a protest and the corresponding counterprotest . \u201c Down with the racists ! Down with the Nazis ! \u201d So why go to such lengths ? These bad actors are trying to polarize the American public by exploiting existing tensions in our society . The goal ? Make Americans see each other as enemies , especially during high-stakes events such as elections . If people feel they can \u2019 t trust their neighbors or their government , democracy falters . \u201c There is a massive , sophisticated , persistent campaign on multiple fronts to misinform , divide and ultimately manipulate the American people .

The raids were a strong sign that prosecutors might soon charge one of Trump \u2019 s fiercest loyalists with a serious crime or crimes , legal experts said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a disgraceful situation , \u201d Trump said . \u201c It \u2019 s a total witch-hunt \u2026 It \u2019 s an attack on our country , what we all stand for . \u201d\nAs the implications of those raids continue to sink in , Trump may be lured towards the kind of drastic action that would send fissures through the executive branch and beyond , multiple former White House and justice department officials interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 said .\n\u201c The raid of Michael Cohen \u2019 s office was a seismic event , for any presidency , \u201d said Andrew Wright , a former White House associate counsel and a professor at Savannah Law School . \u201c I think he [ Cohen ] is in very serious trouble .\n\u201c And sure enough , the president appears to have really come pretty unhinged at that news , so I think that \u2019 s incredibly significant . \u201d\nEven for a White House that can seem to cycle from crisis to extreme crisis , the current pressure on Trump , and the resulting peril for his presidency and the country , is acute , according to seasoned prosecutors .\n\u201c The pressure on the president is actually unimaginable to me , \u201d said Betsy de la Vega , who was a federal prosecutor for more than 20 years .\nWhile the public has no way of knowing how far along Mueller is in his work , De la Vega said , the decision to conduct the Cohen raids , given their high stakes , could indicate that prosecutors had completed significant work behind the scenes .\n\u201c They would have to know that setting it in motion would cause great consternation , to say the least , on the part of Donald Trump and his pals , so that gives me the sense that the pace is increasing . \u201d\nCohen , who has denied all wrongdoing , could face charges including bank fraud , wire fraud , campaign violations , tax crimes or other charges relating to payments made to multiple women in advance of the 2016 election , and communications thereafter with at least one of those women .\nThe prospect of such an indictment is clearly weighing on the president \u2019 s mind . In the week since the Cohen raids , Trump has lashed out at Mueller and his superior , the deputy attorney general , Rod Rosenstein .\n\u201c Mueller is most conflicted of all ( except Rosenstein ... ) , \u201d Trump tweeted in a Wednesday morning tirade against \u201c the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation , headed up by the all Democrat loyalists , or people that worked for Obama \u201d .\nMueller has indicted or reached plea agreements with 19 individuals , including four former senior Trump campaign aides , plus three companies in Russia . He is a Republican , as is Rosenstein . So are Comey and Jeff Sessions , the attorney general .\nPlay Video 0:46 Firing Comey one of Trump 's 'greatest achievements ' , says White House \u2013 video\nBut none of Mueller \u2019 s targets has been as close to Trump as Cohen , who is a friend of the family , has been involved with the Trump children on real estate deals around the world , and who could have a lot to tell prosecutors about operations inside the Trump Organization .\nThe visceral threat of a prosecution so close to his company and his family could drive the president to take a step that the White House asserted last week was within his power : removing Mueller , or perhaps Rosenstein .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a clear pattern of the president seeming to think that the department of justice belongs to him , \u201d said Alex Whiting , a Harvard Law School professor specializing in criminal prosecution issues . \u201c And that \u2019 s deeply concerning . These threats to fire Sessions or fire Mueller or fire Rosenstein all fit into that .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a remarkable disregard for the rule of law . The precedent that this is setting , what this means for our country and our future , is very concerning . \u201d\nThe combined pressures from the investigation , and a media cacophony with outlets such as Fox News touting an imminent Trump \u201c personnel decision , \u201d could be driving Trump toward a dangerous step , said Wright .\n\u201c It feels like there are people that are really trying to tempt the president to take drastic action to try and shut down these investigations , and I think that would just really send us into political convulsions in this country , and I think that would not solve the president \u2019 s problems , it would worsen them , \u201d Wright said .\nJames Comey : high-profile former FBI chief with a reputation for integrity Read more\n\u201c I \u2019 m quite concerned about the precarious situation we find ourselves in right now . \u201d\nMembers of congress in both chambers have said they support passing legislation to protect the special counsel , but such legislation is moving slowly .\nTrump , meanwhile , appears not to have been shaken in his basic faith that the best way to handle the prosecutions swirling around him is to fight back with all the power the presidency can muster .\n\u201c No Collusion or Obstruction ( other than I fight back ) , so now they do the Unthinkable , and RAID a lawyers office for information ! BAD ! \u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the thing he hasn \u2019 t learned from the beginning , \u201d said Wright , discussing Trump \u2019 s relationship with the prosecution .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like being wrapped by a boa constrictor . The more you struggle , the more likely you \u2019 re going to die quickly . And the less you struggle , the more likely you might be able to slip out of its clutches .\n\u201c And instead the president is just wiggling and wiggling and wiggling . \u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2013 House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal escalated the fight over President Donald Trump 's tax returns Friday afternoon when he issued subpoenas for the documents to Department of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Commissioner Charles Rettig .\nThe Treasury Department had previously rejected Neal 's request for six years of the president 's tax returns .\n`` While I do not take this step lightly , I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material , '' Neal said in a statement . `` I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work . \u201d\nOn Monday , Mnuchin rejected Neal \u2019 s request for the president \u2019 s tax returns in a letter .\n`` In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice , I have determined that the Committee 's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose , and pursuant to section 6103 , the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information , '' Mnuchin wrote .\nNeal made the original request for Trump 's 2013-2018 tax returns to the IRS , which is part of the Treasury Department . He invoked a law allowing a select few members of Congress to review individual tax returns for legislative purposes and cited legislative proposals and oversight related to federal tax laws as his basis for the request .\nIt was the first such demand for a sitting president \u2019 s tax information in 45 years .\nNeal also demanded copies of tax returns for Trump 's trust and for his golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey .\nThe subpoena comes as part of a broader effort from Congress to obtain documents and bring administration officials and allies in for questioning .\nOn Wednesday , the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr. to answer more questions .\nEarlier that day , Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress over his refusal to hand over an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's report on the Russian interference in the 2016 election .", "Lois Lerner , the IRS official at the heart of the scandal involving the targeting of Tea Party groups , is retiring .\nLerner , who headed the division in the tax-collecting agency that handles applications for tax-exempt status , had been placed on paid administrative leave in May . Calls for her dismissal came almost immediately following allegations she had participated in unfairly targeting conservative groups .\nThe IRS confirmed on Monday that she has resigned , though it 's unclear how that decision might affect the ongoing congressional investigations into the scandal .\n`` Since May , the IRS has taken decisive actions to correct failures in Exempt Organizations management , replacing top leadership throughout the chain of command , '' the agency said in a written statement announcing her retirement . `` In addition , IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel created an Accountability Review Board to fully review information to ensure proper oversight in handling personnel issues . ''\nThe announcement has not quieted calls for a thorough probe into the agency 's actions . It 's also not clear what kind of government-paid retirement benefits Lerner might be receiving .\n`` Just because Lois Lerner is retiring from the IRS does not mean the investigation is over . Far from it . In fact , there are many serious unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth , '' Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said in a written statement .\nRep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said : `` Lois Lerner 's exit from the IRS does not alter the Oversight Committee 's interest in understanding why applicants for tax exempt status were targeted and inappropriately treated because of their political beliefs . ''\n`` We still do n't know why Lois Lerner , as a senior IRS official , had such a personal interest in directing scrutiny and why she denied improper conduct to Congress . Her departure does not answer these questions or diminish the Committee 's interest in hearing her testimony , '' he said .\nLerner first disclosed the IRS targeting at a May 10 tax law conference .\nLerner then infamously refused to testify at a hearing before Issa 's committee , citing her constitutional right not to incriminate herself . Three congressional committees and the Department of Justice , though , launched investigations into the IRS and its actions .\nEventually , the agency acknowledged that while she was in charge , IRS agents improperly targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status from 2010-2012 .\nEarlier this month , newly released emails seemed to support accusations against the embattled IRS official and her role in scrutinizing applications .\nThe agency had initially tried to spin the story , claiming the unfair targeting was the work of rogue Ohio-based employees .\nOne email dated February 2011 from Lerner said , `` Tea Party Matter very dangerous '' - before going on to warn that the `` matter '' could be used to go to court to test campaign spending limits .\nThe email was released by the House Ways and Means Committee and parts were redacted .", "Lois Lerner , the Internal Revenue Service official under fire for her department \u2019 s targeting of tea party groups , has retired effective Monday , according to the IRS .\nBut that development does not end the scandal that burst into the open last May , when Ms. Lerner revealed that tea party groups were undergoing extra scrutiny in their applications for tax exemption . Lerner , who was director of the IRS \u2019 s section on tax-exempt organizations , had been placed on paid administrative leave , and remains under subpoena by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which is investigating the scandal .\n\u201c Lois Lerner \u2019 s exit from the IRS does not alter the Oversight Committee \u2019 s interest in understanding why applicants for tax exempt status were targeted and inappropriately treated because of their political beliefs , \u201d Rep. Darrell Issa ( R ) of California , chairman of the committee , said in a statement .\nSen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , also signaled his continued interest in the IRS targeting scandal .\n\u201c Just because Lois Lerner is retiring from the IRS does not mean the investigation is over , \u201d Senator Hatch said in a statement . \u201c Far from it . In fact , there are many serious unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth . \u201d\nThe brouhaha has been a political boon to conservatives , who had long suspected they were being targeted by the government in an effort to undermine their activities . The issue is likely to figure in efforts to energize conservatives for the 2014 midterms . Republicans already control the House , but have a shot at taking over the Senate .\nLerner emerged early as a key figure in the targeting scandal . In fact , it was she who brought the practice to light in public on May 10 , when she responded to an audience question \u2013 later revealed to be planted \u2013 at a legal conference . She stated that the targeting was \u201c absolutely incorrect , \u201d \u201c insensitive , \u201d and \u201c inappropriate , \u201d and that \u201c the IRS would like to apologize for that . \u201d\nAt a congressional hearing on May 22 , Lerner said she was proud of her government service , and had done nothing wrong . Then she refused to testify , citing her constitutional right against self-incrimination .\nStarting in 2010 , the IRS began subjecting groups with names that contained conservative keywords , such as \u201c tea party \u201d and \u201c patriot , \u201d to additional scrutiny in their requests for tax exemption , which delayed their applications . It was later revealed that some progressive groups , such as those associated with the Occupy movement , had undergone similar targeting , but not nearly as many as the tea party groups .\nA report by the Treasury Department \u2019 s inspector general for tax administration ( TIGTA ) released on May 14 found that inappropriate criteria were used to identify tax-exempt applications for review , and that Lerner herself had been briefed on the targeting in June 2011 .\nBloomberg News reported Monday that an internal IRS board was going to propose starting the process of firing Lerner , though it had not concluded that she had acted with political bias or willful misconduct . The report also indicated her pension would not have been different had she been fired .\nIn a statement Monday confirming Lerner \u2019 s retirement , the IRS sought to reassure the public that the agency had reformed its procedures .\n\u201c The IRS is making important progress on fixing the underlying management and organizational deficiencies in the EO [ exempt organizations ] area identified by TIGTA , \u201d the statement said . \u201c Our goal is to restore the public \u2019 s faith and trust in the tax system . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

It will be the IRS \u2019 s responsibility to determine whether individuals have health insurance , as mandated under the ACA .", "Hedge funds are essentially defined by their ability to slip through the cracks of the American financial regulatory system . They do n't do banking , so they do n't need a license from a bank regulator . They do n't underwrite securities , so they do n't warrant scrutiny from market regulators . And they are n't open to the mass public , so they evade consumer protection regulation too .\nOne big goal of post-crisis financial regulation was to create a council of all the different regulators \u2014 the Financial Stability Oversight Council \u2014 to make sure that individual regulators ' focus on the trees does n't lead them to miss a forest of potential disaster . That 's why FSOC decided to look at hedge funds , and its initial findings suggest a big possible problem in hedge land .\nOr , rather , two different and related problems . One is that an excessively indebted hedge fund could go bust , leading to problems at the institutions that loaned it money . The other is that a large hedge fund could be forced into a \u201c fire sale \u201d of the assets it owns . In either case , the fund itself going bust wouldn \u2019 t necessarily be a problem for the economy , but the ripple effects it causes might be .\nThanks to new regulations put in place in the wake of the 2007- \u2019 08 financial crisis , regulators are now able to see the outlines of where trouble might arise . But the Treasury Department is warning that unless regulators are able to persuade or cajole more information out of the industry , they could be left flying blind into the next financial crisis . And with a new administration coming to power in Washington , there \u2019 s a strong risk that these warning signs will go unheeded .\nIt \u2019 s easy to forget that the first great bailout of our era involved a hedge fund rather than an enormous `` too big to fail '' bank . The fund at issue , Long-Term Capital Management , had made some big debt-financed bets that went badly awry primarily as a result of Russia defaulting on its national debt in August 1998 .\nThis was an embarrassing failure for some of the hottest names on Wall Street , but also a potentially catastrophic situation for a wider range of economic actors . A number of East Asian countries had entered a financial crisis situation the previous year , and the Russian default had markets across the board jittery . Policymakers feared that LTCM \u2019 s total collapse would lead to a run on other similar firms and an escalating series of losses \u2014 and that this , in turn , could cause the entire credit system to freeze up the way it ultimately did in 2008 . In response , the Fed and the Treasury Department organized a rapid-fire $ 3.625 billion bailout of LTCM by a consortium of major banks as an alternative to an extended bankruptcy process .\nAt the time , it was widely remarked that since hedge funds had revealed themselves as being in need of occasional bailout , they should probably be brought under the regulatory umbrella .\nBut though this bailout involved the participation of government officials as organizers and guarantors , no actual taxpayer funds were expended and no congressional action was needed . Consequently , the political system moved on . Then when a financial crisis did hit in 2008 , it had very little to do with hedge funds . So we got a politically ambitious regulatory overhaul that did not specifically target hedge funds . But it did create FSOC with an institutional mandate to see the whole playing field , and FSOC officials are trying to draw attention to this piece of unfinished business .\nJonah Crane , the deputy assistant secretary in the Treasury Department who serves as the executive of FSOC , spoke on November 16 about two different forms of risk that hedge funds could pose to the broader economy .\nOne is forced asset sales , in which problems at a fund force it to rapidly sell its assets in a way that disrupts other markets . For example , \u201c positions held by a relatively small group of funds \u201d could constitute \u201c a meaningful share of certain key markets , relative to both market size and trading volume. \u201d This raises the risk that a failure at one fund could drastically drive down the value of other funds \u2019 assets , setting off a chain reaction in which an entire key market is devastated by mass selling .\nThe other is counterparty risk . Hedge funds that are not themselves significant to the overall operation of the economy nonetheless owe money to larger institutions . A hedge fund failure could end up \u201c transmitting stress to counterparties that are large , highly interconnected financial institutions . \u201d\nCrane says that on both fronts the situation requires continued monitoring by FSOC , as well as a range of areas in which it could use more and better data from industry to understand exactly what \u2019 s going on .\nOne of the main areas in which Dodd-Frank has made advances relative to the pre-crisis situation is in providing much more data and situational awareness to regulators at various agencies so that they can better understand where risks exist . Ongoing data gaps are particularly worrying because financial regulation is a bit like squeezing a balloon , and the odds are good at any moment that the most alarming risks will have migrated to wherever it is you can \u2019 t see . This current work has been years in the making , and if momentum evaporates as a result of the transition , it could leave a significant lingering risk to the overall global economy .", "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen was in the hot seat on Capitol Hill yesterday over a massive data breach and hacking of highly sensitive taxpayer information , including social security numbers . A number of taxpayers whose information was stolen have also lost their identities .\nInformation and testimony given by Inspector General Russell George revealed the IRS was given multiple warnings and recommendations about how to prevent an attack or breach . The IRS failed to implement all of the recommendations given . More from Americans For Tax Reform ( bolding is mine ) :\nOver the last decade the IRS has failed to implement numerous recommendations that would make taxpayer information more secure . At a Senate Finance Committee hearing today Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ( TIGTA ) Chief J. Russell George revealed that the IRS failed to implement 44 recommendations that would improve the IRS \u2019 s ability to protect taxpayer information from hackers . Of these 44 , ten recommendations were from audits over three years old .\nIf the IRS had implemented these recommendations , taxpayer information would be better protected and last week \u2019 s hack may have been prevented . As George said during today \u2019 s hearing , \u201c It would have been much more difficult had they ( IRS ) implemented all of the recommendations that we made . \u201d\nSince 2007 , the IRS has been warned at least seven times by watchdog groups that it needed to strengthen its protections of taxpayer information .\nIn a 2014 report , TIGTA warned that if stronger protections are not implemented , \u201c taxpayers could be exposed to the loss of privacy and to financial loss and damages resulting from identity theft or other financial crimes. \u201d The report was the latest in a series of warnings about the agency \u2019 s inability to protect taxpayer information .\nA 2013 report found that the IRS had failed to fully implement eight recommendations that would increase security over taxpayer data despite telling TIGTA they had been implemented . A 2011 report found that taxpayer data was vulnerable to hackers and stronger security measures were needed and in 2010 , TIGTA found that the agency had inadequate safeguards to protect taxpayer information from contract workers .\nInstead of modernizing its system to protect taxpayer information from hackers , the IRS wasted taxpayer dollars by purchasing Nerf footballs that were never used , the world \u2019 s largest crossword puzzle , $ 100 lunches , and Thomas the Tank Engine Wristbands .\nThe IRS also spent millions of tax dollars on the production of a series of Star Trek , Gilligan 's Island and dance videos .\nAs Senator Tim Scott mentions in the interview above , the IRS receives $ 1 billion each year for IT work .\nMeanwhile , despite the breach and likely identity theft of 200,000 taxpayers thanks to the negligence of IRS officials , Americans are still required by law to submit personal information to the tax agency or face penalties , fines and in some cases , prison time .", "Lerner retired from the agency effective Monday . Lerner still Hill 's favorite pi\u00f1ata\nLois Lerner is the political pi\u00f1ata that Congress still loves to whack months after she awkwardly acknowledged that the IRS wrongly scrutinized conservative groups for years .\nHer sudden retirement on Monday after 12 years at the agency won \u2019 t change that .\nShe \u2019 s still a central figure in three congressional investigations into the political targeting scandal that embroiled the IRS \u2014 and the Obama administration \u2014 in May . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) has an outstanding subpoena to compel her testimony before his panel .\nAnd as a 30-year veteran of the civil service , Lerner is still eligible for a pension \u2014 something that is sure to further anger critics in Congress .\n\u201c Her departure does not answer these questions or diminish the committee \u2019 s interest in hearing her testimony , \u201d Issa said in a statement .\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch , the top Republican on the Finance Committee , said Lerner \u2019 s retirement \u201c does not mean the investigation is over . \u201d\n\u201c Far from it , \u201d he said . \u201c In fact , there are many serious unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth . \u201d\nEven Democrats who have slammed the GOP for politicizing congressional probes into the IRS didn \u2019 t pull their punches .\n\u201c Lois Lerner is being held responsible for her gross mismanagement of the IRS tax-exempt division , which led to improper handling of applications for tax-exempt status , whether conservative [ or ] progressive , \u201d said Michigan Rep. Sander Levin , the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee .\nA Democratic congressional aide said the IRS was moving toward terminating Lerner after completing an investigation into her role in the targeting controversy .\nThe IRS found that Lerner , who led the agency \u2019 s unit that reviewed requests for tax exemptions , mismanaged her department and was \u201c neglectful of duty \u201d but found no evidence of political bias , the aide said .\nWilliam Taylor , Lerner \u2019 s attorney , did not immediately return a request for comment .\nLerner sparked the IRS scandal in May when she told an American Bar Association conference that the agency wrongly targeted tea party groups applying for a tax exemption . The admission threw the White House into crisis mode , forcing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to ask then-IRS chief Steven Miller to step down .\nPresident Barack Obama later replaced Miller with Daniel Werfel , a former Office of Management and Budget official .\nLerner was placed on administrative leave later in May after an explosive appearance before the House Oversight Committee in which she boldly declared her innocence before invoking her Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination and refused to answer questions from lawmakers .\n\u201c I have not done anything wrong , \u201d she said at the May 22 hearing . \u201c I have not broken any laws . I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations , and I have not provided false information to this or any other committee . \u201d\nIssa and committee Republicans disagreed . They later voted to recall Lerner and said she waived her Fifth Amendment rights by declaring her innocence without allowing lawmakers to question her . Issa hasn \u2019 t indicated when he plans to call Lerner back to Capitol Hill .\nTaylor , Lerner \u2019 s attorney , has told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that his client is interested in immunity in exchange for testifying before Issa \u2019 s panel again .\nLerner quickly became the public face of the IRS scandal . She initially blamed mid-level IRS employees in Cincinnati for the targeting but congressional investigators have rejected that explanation . Emails and documents released by the House Oversight Committee show that Lerner and other senior IRS leaders in Washington knew of the targeting early on .\nDemocrats and Republicans joined together to call for Lerner \u2019 s ouster in the early days of May , saying she misled them about the scope of the targeting and the extent to which IRS \u2019 s top brass knew the details .\nMore recently , congressional Republicans have labored to keep public pressure on the agency by releasing emails and documents from Lerner and other key IRS officials .\nLerner \u2019 s private and public emails discussing the IRS from her tenure are still fair game for congressional investigators and she can still be asked to testify before interested committees .\nThe IRS said in a statement on Monday that it has taken \u201c decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management . \u201d\n\u201c As Werfel has made clear , the behavior cited in the May [ inspector general \u2019 s ] report was the result of mismanagement and poor judgment , \u201d the statement said . \u201c The IRS is making important progress on fixing the underlying management and organizational deficiencies in the [ exempt organizations ] area identified by [ the inspector general ] .

Three weeks later , a Republican state representative introduced legislation that would require constitutional amendments to earn 67 percent of the vote to pass .\nIn Missouri , voters passed measures to raise the minimum wage , legalize medical marijuana and take legislative redistricting out of the hands of legislators . A month later , state House Republicans introduced a bill to nearly double the number of signatures needed to qualify an initiative for the ballot .\nIn Idaho , 60 percent of voters approved an initiative to expand Medicaid to cover low-income residents . Last week , a Republican state senator introduced legislation to increase both the number and geographic spread of signatures required to qualify an initiative .\nRepublican legislators in states across the country have introduced dozens of bills that would make significant changes to the initiative and referendum process , tightening rules and raising requirements after their voters approved progressive proposals that legislators opposed or refused to take up .\nCritics of the proposals say they are a Republican end run around the direct democracy process , meant to stifle popular progressive policies before they get to the ballot .\n\u201c This is , combined with what we saw after the success of many of these ballot initiatives in 2018 , state legislatures undermining the will of the people , \u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo , who runs the progressive Ballot Initiative Strategy Center . \u201c Rather than listen to the will of the people , elected officials are undermining the will of the people . \u201d\nConservative groups such as the Republican State Leadership Committee and the American Legislative Exchange Council have advocated for tightening ballot rules .\nAnd some Democrats have supported similar measures in states such as Oregon and Washington , where low signature requirements have led to crowded ballots .\nFields said her group was watching about 90 bills around the country that would tighten ballot access .\nThe nonpartisan political website Ballotpedia is tracking about 140 pieces of legislation introduced in 31 states related to ballot measures , though some of those bills would loosen requirements .\nSome of the Republicans behind this year \u2019 s bills say they are necessary to curb the influence of big-money groups that increasingly fund some of the most expensive ballot measure campaigns across the country .\nIn Arizona , voters rejected an initiative that would have required the state to generate 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources , which made the ballot with the help of millions of dollars from California billionaire Tom Steyer .\nAfter that measure , state Sen. Vince Leach ( R ) introduced a bill regulating who could collect signatures for a ballot initiative and giving counties more time to inspect signatures once they have been turned in .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty clear to see that over the last six years , we \u2019 ve had any number of initiatives that have started from outside of the state of Arizona , \u201d Leach said in an interview . \u201c We need to protect one of the most precious things we have , and that \u2019 s the ability to go to the ballot and vote . \u201d\nLeach said he does not oppose the initiative process but that the legislature has a responsibility to guard the rights of its own citizens to determine the state \u2019 s direction .\n\u201c The citizens have a right to initiate laws and not only initiate laws but veto laws we pass .

Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson ( R ) signed his bill earlier this year .\nSome liberal states are also considering changes that would take power away from voters .

Most states that allow citizens to place legislation on the ballot adopted the practice during the Progressive Era in the early 1900s , in part to fight the influence of major corporations in the timber , railroad and oil industries .\nToday , 27 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of direct democracy , either through citizen-initiated propositions and constitutional amendments or through ballot measures authored by the legislature that then go to voters for approval or rejection .\nConservative groups , especially anti-tax organizations , used ballot measures to limit states \u2019 abilities to levy new taxes in the last several decades , beginning with California \u2019 s Proposition 13 , which passed in 1978 .\nMore recently , liberal groups have increasingly turned to ballot measures to raise the minimum wage , expand health care coverage and protect union rights \u2014 especially in states where Republicans won control of legislatures after the 2010 midterm elections .\nBallot measures have become a booming political business . Supporters and opponents spent more than $ 1 billion on propositions put before voters in each of the last three even-numbered election years . Several propositions in California generated nearly $ 100 million in spending in 2018 .", "On Tuesday , the Dhillon Law Group , where I serve as an election law attorney , filed a lawsuit against the state of California . This lawsuit alleges that California is violating federal law by not ensuring that only citizens are on the state \u2019 s voting rolls . Three California voters brought this lawsuit : Roxanne Hoge , Ali Mazarei , and Corrin Rankin . Both Hoge and Mazarei are legal immigrants who earned the privilege to vote by becoming citizens of the United States .\nIn 1993 , a Democrat-controlled Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the National Voter Registration Act ( NVRA ) . This law mandated that states create more options for individuals to register to vote . This law also placed restrictions on the states on how they were to maintain their voter rolls . Under the NVRA , the state has a duty to regularly maintain the voter rolls by removing those individuals who had died or moved away .\nThe NVRA also requires a state \u2019 s secretary of state to determine the eligibility of each applicant before placing him or her on its voter rolls . Eligibility throughout the NVRA means that there is citizenship . Thus , the NVRA requires the states to ensure that someone is a citizen prior to placing him or her on the voter rolls .\nState records show that before the California secretary of state \u2019 s office places an applicant on the voter rolls , it checks with state administrative records to ensure the individual is not a felon and that the voter application is not a duplicate . The state admits that it does not review state administrative records to determine if an applicant is a citizen of the United States . If California does not even bother to check the citizenship status of voter applicants , it can continue to claim to the media that there is no evidence of non-citizens being placed on its voter rolls .\nLast year , the California secretary of state admitted he had no idea how many non-citizens were on the voter rolls . Earlier this year , a state audit was released that showed non-citizens were not only registered to vote , but had voted in California elections . These two news stories made it clear that California did not use state administrative records to ensure that only citizens were being registered to vote . Rather than follow federal law and make a determination of citizenship before placing an applicant on the voter rolls , the state simply waits for a scandal to break before responding by removing a non-citizen from its voter rolls . This is improper .\nThe California secretary of state has claimed that there is no state administrative record that tracks citizenship of Californians . This is clearly not true , since a state audit was able to determine that non-citizens were not only on the voter rolls but had also actually voted . Contrary to what the secretary of state wants the media to believe , there are multiple state administrative records that contain the citizenship status of voters . Every applicant for a state driver \u2019 s license is required to provide proof of identity . These proof-of-identity documents include citizenship status . If an individual can not prove that he/she is lawfully a United States citizens , a driver \u2019 s license is still doled out but that individual is supposedly not simultaneously also registered to vote .\nBy bringing this lawsuit , the plaintiffs desire to hold the secretary of state \u2019 s feet to the fire . It is time that California be required to follow federal law and ensure that everyone who is on the voter rolls is actually eligible to vote . This lawsuit is necessary because California has a bad habit of thumbing its nose at federal election laws and dragging its feet as long as possible . When Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002 \u2014 which required states to establish a statewide voter registration list \u2014 California was the last state to comply . It did not do so until 2016 .\nEarlier this year , Judicial Watch won a major victory against California requiring the state to follow federal law in removing from the voter rolls those who have died and those who have moved . California had chosen to simply not send out the required notices , and the voter rolls were thus bloated with ineligible voters .\nCalifornians deserve the assurance that the state is following federal law and ensuring that only citizens are on the voter rolls . By its own admissions , the state is not verifying voter applicants \u2019 citizenship status . Since California has claimed that it is not doing anything wrong , this lawsuit had to be brought to force California to follow the NVRA .\nMark Meuser is an election law attorney with the Dhillon Law Group , which is based in California .

There are multiple reasons :\nWhen people get a driver 's license or identification card , they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt-out . That automatic registration begins when people get their licenses at 16-years-old but does n't go into effect until the person turns 18 . How do we know that the state is actually keeping that information safe for a year or two until the individual decides to vote ? How do we know their party preference has changed in that time frame ?\nOver the last 10 years , there has been a massive push to get voters to utilize absentee ballots . This helps ensure people make more informed decisions and vote at their own convenience , but along with that convenience comes risk . There 's no way to verify that the person whose name is on the ballot is the one who actually voted . There 's no way to know that the right person actually received the ballot . And there 's nothing keeping thieves from stealing a ballot out of a person 's mailbox .\nWhen people show up at the polls they 're not always required to show their ID , especially in liberal states like California . The poll worker simply asks you for your name and address and off you go . Again , there 's no way for them to verify you are who you say you are . And that 's why people who have passed away are still casting votes from their graves .\nWhat 's taking place in California really is n't all that surprising . It just reaffirms the idea that voter rolls need to be purged every year or two , people 's information needs to be verified and cross-referenced before ballots are sent out and IDs need to be checked at the polling booth . These are simple fixes but they 're the very ones that Democrats are resistant to .", "Democrats have a direct political interest in making voting easier for their demographic supporters ; Republicans are dependent on white people and older voters who already turn out in large numbers . \u201c Fear of the increasing diversity of America is driving this , \u201d says Carol Anderson , chair of African American studies at Emory University .\nThey \u2019 re passing photo ID laws , cutting early voting hours , and purging voter rolls of infrequent voters , citing the need to defend against fraud . Democratic leaders are angry about the changes , charging that the real aim is to make it harder for minorities and younger people \u2013 key Democratic constituencies \u2013 to vote . In a larger sense , the battle is part of a broader war between the Democratic coalition of transformation , composed of groups comfortable with rapid racial and cultural change , and the Republican coalition of restoration , reliant on voters who aren \u2019 t .\nFifty-four years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law , a renewed and intensifying struggle over ballot access and voting power is shaking the structure of American democracy . It began in 2013 , when the Supreme Court struck down a key Voting Rights Act provision and freed nine states , most in the South , to change their election laws without advance approval from the federal government . Since then , some Republican governors and GOP-controlled state legislatures have begun tightening access to the ballot box .\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson used 50 pens to sign the Voting Rights Act into law . Television footage of the Aug. 6 , 1965 , ceremony shows the president putting each to paper for a moment , scratching perhaps a half-letter , and then swapping the instrument out for new . When finished , he handed the pens to some of the famous figures gathered around him . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy got one . So did the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr . So did civil rights activist and future member of Congress John Lewis .\nMost pen recipients felt it was one of America \u2019 s finest hours . The law put federal muscle behind African Americans \u2019 long struggle for equal voting booth access \u2013 and the political power that access bestowed . But Johnson \u2019 s own feelings that day were complicated . His daughter Luci Baines Johnson later told journalist Ari Berman , in an interview for his voting rights history \u201c Give Us the Ballot , \u201d that LBJ felt both victorious and afraid .\nPresident Johnson knew he had just transformed the political structure of the nation , in ways both predictable and unforeseen . He could no longer control what would happen , the progress and the inevitable backlash , and how those might balance .\n\u201c It would be written in the history books . But now the history had to be made , \u201d Ms. Johnson said .\nFifty-four years later , a renewed and intensifying struggle over ballot access and voting power is shaking the intricate structure of American democracy .\nIn the short run , the vote \u2013 who gets it , who doesn \u2019 t , what it \u2019 s worth \u2013 is almost certain to loom large in the 2020 elections . Top Democratic presidential contenders have all criticized recent GOP-led tightening of some state voting laws , claiming these changes are partly intended to make it harder for minorities to cast ballots .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got Jim Crow sneaking back in , \u201d said former Vice President Joe Biden in a speech in South Carolina on May 6 , evoking the racial segregation laws of the past .\nIn the long run , this conflict could redraw the battle lines between America \u2019 s two big political parties during a period of rapid demographic change . That \u2019 s why Democrats made it their first order of legislative business after retaking the House in the 2018 midterms , passing H.R . 1 , a sweeping bill that would establish national automatic voter registration , outlaw the \u201c purging \u201d of voter rolls , and in general ease and expand ballot access while countering some state-imposed voting barriers .\nMark Humphrey/AP Suzanne Lanier ( l. ) holds up a sign in the Tennessee House gallery opposing a bill that would impose new restrictions on groups that hold voter registration drives , April 15 , 2019 , in Nashville , Tenn .\nVoting access is becoming a crucial front in what CNN political analyst and journalist Ron Brownstein has dubbed a broader war between the Democratic coalition of transformation , composed of groups comfortable with rapid racial and cultural change , and the Republican coalition of restoration , reliant on voters who aren \u2019 t .\nMore and more , American electoral politics seems correlated with demographics . The modern Democratic Party is increasingly made up of minorities and young people , and thus has a direct interest in making voting as easy and widespread as possible . Republicans , conversely , are dependent on white people and older voters , demographic groups already more likely to cast ballots . The GOP thus has a direct political incentive to tighten rules and restrict electoral access .\n\u201c Fear of the increasing diversity of America is driving this , \u201d says Carol Anderson , chair of African American studies at Emory University and author of \u201c One Person , No Vote : How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy . \u201d\nMany Republicans reject this framework . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has flatly refused to bring to the floor a Senate version of H.R . 1 \u2013 or , as he calls it , the \u201c Democrat Politician Protection Act . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s an attempt to rewrite the rules of American politics in order to benefit one side over the other , \u201d Senator McConnell said on the Senate floor . The bill is a nakedly partisan attempt to grow Washington \u2019 s power over Americans \u2019 political speech and elections , the Kentucky senator charged . It would impose onerous and confusing regulations on states and localities , \u201c while making it harder for [ them ] to clean inaccurate data off their voter rolls , harder to remove duplicate registrations , ineligible voters , and other errors . \u201d\nThe larger conservative position is that America has come a long way on voting , thanks to the Voting Rights Act and other massive changes , and the country and its laws should recognize that . This was the view underpinning the majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder , a pivotal 2013 Supreme Court decision that freed nine mostly Southern states to change their election laws without obtaining advance approval from the federal government .\nWhen the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 , voter registration of African Americans in Mississippi was 6.4 % , wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion . By the 2004 election , Mississippi \u2019 s black registration rate was 76 % , 4 percentage points higher than that of white people .\n\u201c Our country has changed , \u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the opinion . \u201c While any racial discrimination in voting is too much , Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions . \u201d\nVoting is fundamental to the exercise of democracy . If there were no votes , how would the collective will of eligible citizens be expressed ? Justice Roberts , in his 2005 Senate confirmation hearing , noted that voting was the \u201c preservative \u201d of all the other American rights . \u201c Without access to the ballot box , people are not in a position to protect any other rights that are important to them , \u201d he said .\nGiven that , it \u2019 s perhaps surprising that the Founding Fathers did not leave behind a bit more instruction on the issue . The Constitution did not guarantee voting rights for Americans . Instead , it allowed the states to set their own voting rules .\nAt the time of the Constitution \u2019 s ratification , most states limited voting to white male property owners . By some estimates , these eligible voters constituted only 6 % of the nation \u2019 s population . Democracy , indeed .\nSuffrage is a \u201c part of the Constitution that has not aged well , \u201d wrote George Mason University political scientist Jennifer Victor in a recent Vox series on the document \u2019 s flaws .\nMark J. Terrill/AP/File A voter fills out a registration form before getting in line at the Los Angeles County registrar 's office on Nov. 6 , 2018 .\nSince 1789 , periodic waves of reform have greatly enlarged the eligible U.S. voting population . In the 1800s , many states struck the \u201c property owner \u201d requirement , opening up voting to most white males . In 1870 , the ratification of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution technically gave all African Americans , including former slaves , access to the ballot . In response , Southern states adopted poll taxes and literacy tests , and employed open violence to disenfranchise African Americans and retain white political hegemony .\nSome states opened the voting franchise to women in the decades before and after the turn of the 20th century , but women weren \u2019 t fully allowed ballot access until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 . The most recent reform wave crested with the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which banned discriminatory voter qualification practices , and authorized deployment of federal officials to register voters and oversee elections in areas with a history of blocking minorities from the polls .\nA key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act ordered states with a poor minority voting record , most of them Southern , to ask Washington for permission before doing almost anything to change voting procedures , from moving a polling place to redrawing legislative districts . It \u2019 s this part of the law that the Roberts court deemed no longer necessary and struck down in 2013 .\nIn the context of the long rise of democracy throughout the Western world , the voting record of the United States is mixed . The U.S. was indeed one of the first democratic countries to expand its electorate by knocking down explicit economic barriers to political participation , writes Alexander Keyssar , a Harvard professor of history and social policy , in his book \u201c The Right to Vote : The Contested History of Democracy in the United States. \u201d Alexis de Tocqueville and other foreign observers were struck by what they perceived as the nation \u2019 s powerful democratic spirit in the early decades of the 1800s .\nBut the U.S. was also unusual in that it experienced a contraction of voting rights as Southern segregationists essentially negated the 15th Amendment following Reconstruction .\n\u201c Despite its pioneering role in promoting democratic values , the United States was one of the last countries in the developed world to attain universal suffrage , \u201d writes Dr. Keyssar .\nToday , the story of voting rights in America is largely a tale of two kinds of states , moving in two different directions .\nSome states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively blue ones \u2013 are adopting measures to make it easier to register and vote . Automatic voter registration , for example , is a system where citizens who interact with government agencies are automatically added to the voter rolls , or automatically have their address or other voter information updated , unless they opt out of the process . Fifteen states covering about a third of the U.S. population , from Vermont and New Jersey to Nevada and California ( plus the District of Columbia ) , now have some form of automatic registration , according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law .\nBruce Newman/Oxford Eagle/AP/File A poll worker checks a voter 's identification against a list before allowing her to vote in the party primary , June 3 , 2014 , at the Oxford Park Commission in Oxford , Mississippi .\nOther states \u2013 mainly but not exclusively red ones \u2013 are going in the opposite direction and tightening voting rules . These changes range from strict requirements for photo IDs to cutbacks in the time allowed for early voting to the winnowing of presumed nonvoters from the rolls and other general registration restrictions . Since the 2010 midterms , at least 25 states have enacted tougher ballot laws , according to the Brennan Center .\nSome of these changes , in basic form , garner widespread approval among voters . This is particularly true of photo ID . A 2016 Associated Press poll found that 79 % of respondents favored requiring all voters to provide some form of photo identification .\nProponents frame many of the changes as a means to defend against fraud . But the days of deceased voters allegedly casting ballots in Illinois \u2019 Cook County , and voter turnout in some Louisiana precincts reaching 120 % , are long over . Documented cases of in-person fraud are \u201c super rare , \u201d says Dan Hopkins , a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on elections and public opinion .\nOne 2014 study in an academic journal , Dr. Hopkins points out , concluded that in the U.S. voter impersonation \u2013 the fraud against which photo ID is meant to defend \u2013 is reported at about the same rate as instances of alleged abduction by extraterrestrials .\nThe problem , Dr. Hopkins notes , is America \u2019 s long and troubled history of denying racial minorities their right to vote . Today \u2019 s new restrictions are inevitably seen in that old context .\nTake photo ID . Many Americans see that as an easy hurdle to surmount . Who doesn \u2019 t have a driver \u2019 s license or a passport or something like that ?\nLots of people , actually . And they tend to be those on the edges of mainstream economic society . People of color , poorer people , both young and elderly , tend to be most affected by ID requirements .\nThe effects of the restrictions can also depend on the way they are set up . Dr. Anderson of Emory University uses the example of Alabama . In that state , you have to have a government-issued ID to vote \u2013 but a public housing ID doesn \u2019 t count . Seventy-one percent of public housing occupants in the state are African Americans . Also , Alabama has been closing Department of Motor Vehicle offices in black counties .\nYou create an obstacle , then you create an obstacle to the obstacle , says Dr. Anderson . \u201c We believed we had overcome , \u201d she says . \u201c We haven \u2019 t . \u201d\nDr. Anderson says that one of her goals when writing her 2018 book \u201c One Person No Vote \u201d was to counter the idea that many of the new voting restrictions are just reasonable responses to concerns about the integrity of America \u2019 s voting systems .\nPoor people move often , so they miss the official postcards asking if they wish to remain on the voting rolls . Young people , students , and minorities disproportionately don \u2019 t vote regularly . After missing a few ballots , their names start to be crossed out as well .\nRight now America isn \u2019 t a real democracy , Dr. Anderson says .\n\u201c We came close to being a democracy with the Voting Rights Act , \u201d she says . \u201c But the forces of white supremacy have kept fighting back . \u201d\nDo voting restrictions actually affect elections ? If so , how much ?\nDr. Anderson and other fierce critics would certainly say yes . Their Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin . Wisconsin \u2019 s voter ID law , passed under GOP Gov . Scott Walker , requires all voters to present a driver \u2019 s license , state ID , passport , military ID , naturalization papers , or tribal ID to vote . ( Other forms of ID are acceptable under certain circumstances . ) Voters without proper identification can cast a provisional ballot , which will count if they present the document at a state office within 72 hours of the election .\nIn 2016 , the first presidential election affected by the new law , there were 60,000 fewer votes for president than in 2012 , says Dr. Anderson . Sixty-eight percent of the decline was in Milwaukee alone , a heavily Democratic and minority area .\nMorry Gash/AP/File Observers look over test results as a statewide presidential election recount began Dec. 1 , 2016 , in Milwaukee . Donald Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point over Hillary Clinton after polls had predicted a Clinton victory .\nDonald Trump won Wisconsin by roughly 20,000 votes . It was a harbinger of similarly close triumphs in other Rust Belt states that helped provide his margin of victory .\nBut many political scientists have a more nuanced view on the subject .\nEvidence shows that photo ID requirements and other restrictions indeed prevent some voters from casting ballots or going to the polls in the first place , says Dr. Hopkins of the University of Pennsylvania . But studies also show that the magnitude of the effect is not great enough to actually sway many outcomes .\n\u201c This is an important issue of voter rights and civil rights . But the levels of disenfranchisement we have seen do not indicate any election we can point to that would have been shifted , \u201d says Dr. Hopkins .\nTake Wisconsin . It \u2019 s true minority turnout dropped in 2016 relative to 2012 . But was that due to voting restrictions , or the fact that Barack Obama , the nation \u2019 s first African American president , wasn \u2019 t on the ballot ? How did party mobilization efforts compare for those years ? Could there have been some other factor ?\nLike many states , Wisconsin also has something of a split personality on voting issues . Under a GOP-led state government , it tightened ID laws \u2013 but it also allows same-day voter registration .\nThe way restrictions are drawn up and implemented also matters a lot . What IDs count ? The question of whether a student ID is acceptable makes a big difference in heavily collegiate states such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin .\nIn the short run , new restrictions can sometimes even boost turnout . Studies have shown that they can produce a powerful emotional response among Democrats in general and affected groups in particular , spurring a counter-mobilization that actually leads to higher turnout at the polls . That response might eventually wear off \u2013 but long-term effects are difficult to predict . Older voters tend to skew Republican , and as they age they become statistically less likely to have driver \u2019 s licenses , passports , or other IDs .\nNevertheless , the partisan intent seems clear . It is Republican governors and legislators who are pushing for and implementing new restrictions . In 2012 , Pennsylvania \u2019 s Republican state House leaders said publicly that the state \u2019 s new voter ID law would \u201c allow \u201d GOP candidate Mitt Romney to take the state . ( A state judge later threw out the law as contrary to Pennsylvania \u2019 s Constitution . )\nPresident Trump has called for a nationwide photo ID requirement , saying it would ensure only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections . ( Multiple nationwide studies have found only a handful of documented cases of noncitizen votes . )\n\u201c There are sometimes clear political motivations [ for instituting voting restrictions ] , \u201d says Dr. Hopkins .\nBut voter photo ID , \u201c purges \u201d of infrequent voters from the rolls , and other moves are not the only things affecting the voting rates of minorities . At a time when America is rapidly becoming more diverse , it is voters \u2019 own disengagement that may be most slowing the rise of the \u201c transformative \u201d coalition , and maintaining the clout of the \u201c restorative \u201d counterpart .\n\u201c It is this broader story of encouraging people to participate that \u2019 s the issue , \u201d says Bernard Fraga , assistant professor of political science at Indiana University and author of \u201c The Turnout Gap : Race , Ethnicity , and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America . \u201d\nThe U.S. has long lagged on turnout compared with other developed nations . In part , this is because registration to vote in the U.S. has traditionally been an individual responsibility . Other nations may vote on weekends , or holidays . According to Pew Research data , 24 nations make voting compulsory , including the perennial top turnout nation , Belgium , which averages close to a 90 % turnout .\nIn U.S. presidential elections , about 50 % to 60 % of eligible voting-age citizens typically turn out to vote . Midterms attract a turnout of about 40 % , while local elections draw even less . Municipal primaries may be decided by as little as 15 % of those eligible to vote .\nTurnout of minority groups in America is particularly low . Whether it is the barrier of an ID , or simply apathy \u2013 a decision to not decide on political choices \u2013 minority turnout lags far behind that of white people , says Dr. Fraga .\nIn 2016 , 65.3 % of eligible white people said they voted , according to Pew data . Forty-nine percent of black people said the same thing , representing a sharp decline from 2012 \u2019 s record 66.6 % turnout .\nLatino turnout lagged behind at 47.6 % , according to Pew . A greater number of eligible Latinos have not voted than voted in each presidential election since 1996 .\nAsian Americans historically do not break the 50 % turnout barrier , either . In 2016 , their voting percentage was 49.3 .\nVoter ID and other restrictive policies don \u2019 t explain this minority turnout gap , says Dr. Fraga . Some states that have implemented relatively tight laws actually have higher minority turnout numbers .\nAnd the gap has clear electoral effects . If minority turnout had equaled white turnout , given that minorities are preponderantly Democratic , Hillary Clinton would have won the presidency in 2016 instead of being narrowly defeated . Democrats would have regained a majority in the Senate .\nInterestingly , the turnout gap is much smaller in places where minority groups make up a larger share of the population . This may be due to the fact that African Americans or Latinos feel they have the power to affect outcomes in a way they do not in overwhelmingly white areas . Or it may be because political campaigns cater to them and target them more when they might make more of a difference .\n\u201c The broad conclusion is , this is a story about engagement , empowerment , and mobilization , \u201d says Dr. Fraga .\nAll of this \u2013 sweeping demographic change , voter ID , voter roll \u201c purges , \u201d minority turnout , plus cameo appearances by partisan gerrymandering and the Electoral College \u2013 may roll into the electoral storm of the century in 18 months .\nThe 2018 midterms saw a huge spike in voter interest and turnout . As Dr. Hopkins pointed out in his 2018 book \u201c The Increasingly United States : How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized , \u201d the old saying that \u201c all politics is local \u201d has now been turned on its head . All politics is now national , focused on the big stories from Washington via social media and nationalized media . Midterm interest was driven by anger toward and defense of President Trump . With the president himself on the ballot next fall , turnout could be off the charts .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

The news and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings .\nDES MOINES , Iowa \u2014 President Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign and allies have blocked efforts to expand mail-in voting , forcing an awkward confrontation with top GOP election officials who are promoting the opposite in their states .\nThe rare dissonance between Trump and other Republican elected officials also reflects another reality the president will not concede : Many in his party believe expanding mail-in voting could ultimately help him .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign has intervened directly in Ohio , while allies have fired warning shots in Iowa and Georgia , aimed at blunting Republican secretaries of state in places that could be competitive in November .\n\u201c There is a dimension to legislatures underfunding or undercutting election officials that could ironically backfire and hurt Republicans , \u201d said Michael McDonald , a University of Florida professor and director of the nonpartisan United States Election Project .\nAction by these three secretaries of state , who are the top election officials in their states , was designed to make ballot access easier during the coronavirus pandemic . Trump has repeatedly made the unfounded claim that voting by mail could lead to fraud so extensive it could undermine the integrity of the presidential election .\nIn Ohio last month , senior Trump campaign adviser Bob Paduchik weighed in on Secretary of State Frank LaRose \u2019 s proposal , insisting to GOP legislative leaders that they drop a provision to allow voters to file absentee ballot applications online , according to Republican officials involved in the discussions . The GOP officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications regarding the legislation .\nOhio already allows the secretary of state to send absentee ballot requests to every registered voter . The provision was aimed at allowing a faster processing option , while making mail-in application processing available .\nPaduchik , Trump \u2019 s 2016 Iowa campaign director , insisted there be no substantive changes ahead of the November election in Ohio , which Trump won in 2016 by 8 percentage points under the existing rules , according to the GOP officials .\nTrump campaign aides did not respond to requests for comment .\n\u201c This bill didn \u2019 t do everything I wanted it to do . In fact , there \u2019 s several things I wanted to get done that are not included in this bill , \u201d LaRose said in a video statement this month , promising to try \u201d to get some of those other changes made in the future . \u201d\nLet our news meet your inbox . The news and stories that matters , delivered weekday mornings . This site is protected by recaptcha\nTrump has railed against expanding vote by mail , arguing without evidence that the practice , despite being the primary voting method in Colorado , Hawaii , Oregon , Washington and Utah , is ripe for widespread fraud .\nOn Sunday , he renewed the criticism , tweeting \u201c Mail-In Voting , on the other hand , will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history . Bad things happen with Mail-Ins . \u201d\nThat claim is part of a pattern . He also has incorrectly equated a secretary of state widely distributing absentee ballot requests with the ballots themselves in Michigan .\nLast week , after Iowa voters broke a 26-year-old statewide primary election turnout record , the Iowa Senate \u2019 s GOP majority pressed to bar Secretary of State Paul Pate from sending absentee ballots to all 2 million registered voters this fall , as he did before the June 3 primary .\nRepublican Gov . Kim Reynolds , a Trump ally , last week signed compromise legislation requiring Pate and his successors to seek approval from a partisan legislative council for similar future actions . The GOP-controlled council unanimously rejected Pate \u2019 s request to widely send absentee ballot applications this fall .\n\u201c My goal was to protect Iowa voters and poll workers while finding ways to conduct a clean and fair election , \u201d Pate said last month . \u201c I stand by my decisions . \u201d\nHis Georgia counterpart , Brad Raffensperger , faced a similar fate after he , too , sent absentee ballot applications to nearly 7 million registered voters ahead of the state \u2019 s June primary . Although Raffensperger objected to proposed limits being put on his authority , legislation to do that died when the legislature adjourned and after he said he would not repeat the move this fall .\nTrump carried Georgia , Iowa and Ohio comfortably in 2016 . To win again , he would likely need to match his sizable winning margins in their rural counties , home to many in his older , white base .\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has backed mail-in voting , saying it would make it easier for people to vote this November amid the coronavirus pandemic .\nSome longtime GOP activists say expanded vote by mail is essential for older voters who are accustomed to voting in person but hesitant to during the pandemic and who are unfamiliar with the process .\nAnn Trimble Ray , a veteran Iowa GOP activist , voted in June by mail and says Pate made the right call , especially for the many older voters in her rural home in Sac County , which Trump carried with 72 % of the 2016 vote .\n\u201c Reducing their exposure by voting absentee , we think , was a considerate thing to do , \u201d she said . \u201c I was grateful for Secretary of State Pate \u2019 s mailing and encouragement for absentee voting . \u201d\nConsolidation of rural polling places , shrunken election staff and long lines may deter rural voters vital to Trump , said University of California Irvine professor Richard Hasen , chair of a committee of U.S. scholars that has recommended changes ahead of the 2020 elections .\n\u201c The voters Trump is hurting are likely his own when he \u2019 s making these comments against mail-in balloting , \u201d said Hasen , \u201c because it \u2019 s a safe and generally effective way to cast a ballot , especially in the midst of a pandemic . \u201d\nThe check on ballot request steps in Iowa and Georgia also could threaten rural votes from being counted , based on McDonald \u2019 s study .\nThough Ohio counts all mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day , a number of absentee ballots came in late for the March 17 primary , including 4,000 in Greene County in southeast Ohio , a county where Trump won 60 % of the vote .\nUnderstaffed election offices and longer processing time between rural areas and metro postal centers could leave some rural voters unable to mail their ballots on time , McDonald said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m pretty convinced that ballot request step is hurting rural voters , \u201d McDonald said .", "\u200b\u200bIn their lame-duck session , Republicans passed legislation that removed key powers from both Evers and Kaul and transferred them to lawmakers . Most notably , Republicans took away Evers \u2019 ability to appoint members of several state boards and agencies . They also usurped Kaul \u2019 s authority to decide whether to approve court settlements and whether the state should even defend lawsuits like those challenging voter suppression and gerrymandering . And they slashed early voting availability , although that move had been put on hold until the recent 7th Circuit ruling .\nThe Supreme Court upheld the laws stripping powers from Evers and Kaul , an unsurprising decision given the court \u2019 s ruling last year that rejected a challenge to the legality of the entire lame-duck session itself . These decisions , along with one in April that blocked Evers from postponing elections that month to avoid exposing voters to coronavirus , cement the court \u2019 s Republican-aligned majority as one of the most partisan in the nation\u2014one that has willingly facilitated GOP legislators \u2019 attempt to reject the legitimacy of Democratic victories in 2018 .\nMeanwhile , in the voter ID case , the court revived a limit of two weeks for early voting , which had been allowed for as long as six weeks in some parts of the state . The judges also restored a requirement that voters maintain residency for at least 28 days to be able to vote at a given location , even if they \u2019 ve moved from elsewhere within the state . Voters with fewer than 28 days of residency would have to vote at their previous address .\nIn addition , the court barred the state from letting most voters receive an absentee ballot by fax or email so that they can print them out and return them by mail , even though military and overseas voters are permitted to do so . Multiple federal courts have also temporarily allowed blind voters in other states to obtain ballots this way due to the pandemic .\nMost ominously , the judges , all of whom were appointed by Republicans , implied that any manipulation of election laws for partisan gain was constitutional even for laws that potentially discriminate against voters based on race . \u201c If one party can make changes that it believes help its candidates , the other can restore the original rules or revise the new ones , \u201d they wrote , even though the very purpose of such laws is to make it impossible for the disadvantaged party to regain control .\nThis reasoning is the logical extension of the U.S. Supreme Court \u2019 s 2019 decision prohibiting all federal challenges to partisan gerrymandering . If adopted by other courts , especially the Supreme Court , it would be open season for lawmakers to all but rig elections outright .\nThe ruling , however , was not a complete defeat for the plaintiffs . The 7th Circuit did uphold a decision letting college students use expired university IDs , as well as a prohibition on requiring schools to share citizenship information with the state . The judges gave the lower courts a chance to rewrite their now-invalidated injunctions to give voters who lack an ID the ability to easily get one , though that may be easier said than done especially because of the pandemic . The plaintiffs have not yet indicated whether they will appeal .\nIn a third recent case , the Wisconsin Supreme Court opted not to expedite an appeal by conservative activists who are trying to compel the state to purge roughly 129,000 voter registrations . The court won \u2019 t hear the case at least until Sept. 29 , when progressive Judge Jill Karofsky will have replaced conservative Justice Dan Kelly following her victory in April \u2019 s election .\nThe timing matters because with Kelly still in office , conservatives would likely have had at least a 4-to-3 majority in favor of ordering the purge . However , once Karofsky takes her seat , conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn will most probably decide the fate of this lawsuit . Earlier this year , he sided with the progressive minority in declining to expedite the case , though it \u2019 s unclear which way Hagedorn leans on the merits of the case . Even if the court permits the purge , such a decision may come too late to affect the November general election .\n\u25cf Arkansas : Redistricting reformers have submitted approximately 99,000 signatures to place an amendment on November \u2019 s ballot to establish an independent redistricting commission . About 89,000 signatures must be found valid , including an amount equivalent to 5 % of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in at least 15 of Arkansas \u2019 75 counties .\nSubmitting only 10,000 more signatures than the minimum needed gives the initiative \u2019 s backers less margin for error than is typically advised for such an effort , and even supporters estimate that only around 75,000 of their signatures are probably valid . However , Arkansas gives organizers one additional month to gather signatures if their initial submission includes valid signatures equivalent to 75 % of the total needed both statewide and in at least 15 counties .\nSupporters are waging an ongoing federal lawsuit seeking to suspend a requirement that initiative petition signatures be witnessed or notarized in-person . A lower court had temporarily blocked the requirement , allowing voters to sign petitions at home and mail them in , but the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a short-term stay of that ruling last month while it decides whether to issue a lengthier stay while the GOP \u2019 s appeal proceeds .\nSeparately , electoral reform supporters have submitted roughly 95,000 signatures for a different constitutional amendment that would establish a \u201c top-four \u201d primary . Under this system , all candidates regardless of party would compete on a single primary ballot , with the top four finishers advancing to a general election that would be decided by instant-runoff voting .\n\u25cf Massachusetts : Supporters of a ballot initiative that would enact a statute implementing instant-runoff voting in congressional and state elections have submitted nearly double the 13,000 additional signatures needed to qualify for November \u2019 s ballot . As a result , it \u2019 s likely that voters will have a chance to decide whether to make Massachusetts the second state after Maine to adopt this reform for all state and federal races , aside from the presidency .\n\u25cf North Dakota : Supporters of a ballot initiative that would amend North Dakota \u2019 s constitution to reform redistricting and its electoral system have submitted some 37,000 signatures to qualify for the November ballot , 27,000 of which must be valid . Officials will determine by Aug. 10 whether the measure has qualified .\nAs we \u2019 ve previously detailed , this measure would replace traditional primaries with a \u201c top-four \u201d system where the four candidates with the most support would advance to the general election regardless of party . From there , instant-runoff voting would be used to determine the winner . Additionally , the measure would require that any voting machines create a paper record of every vote\u2014North Dakota currently uses paper ballots by default and voting machines for voters with disabilities\u2014and that the secretary of state conduct routine audits of elections .\nThe other major change would remove the Republican-dominated legislature \u2019 s control over state legislative redistricting ( North Dakota only has a single congressional district , which covers the entire state ) . The proposal would hand redistricting over to the state Ethics Commission , which voters created with a 2018 ballot initiative . The commission \u2019 s five members are chosen by unanimous agreement of the governor and the majority and minority leaders of the state Senate ; they would draw maps using several nonpartisan criteria .\n\u25cf San Francisco , CA : The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously voted to put a referendum on the ballot this November that would amend the city \u2019 s charter to lower the voting age to 16 in local elections .\nVoters narrowly rejected a similar proposal 52-48 in a 2016 referendum , but if they pass the measure this time , San Francisco would become the first major city in the country to lower the voting age , though a few small localities in Maryland already allow 16-year-olds to vote in local elections .\nRelatedly , all California voters will also get a chance to decide on another November referendum that would amend the state constitution to let 17-year-olds vote in primary elections for all levels of government if they will turn 18 by the time of the general election , a policy that a number of states already allow .\n\u25cf Michigan : A federal district court has dismissed a Republican-backed lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Michigan \u2019 s new independent redistricting commission that voters passed at the ballot box in 2018 . This ruling follows a GOP loss in April before a panel of three judges on the GOP-heavy 6th Circuit Court of Appeals , which had unanimously upheld the lower court \u2019 s refusal to temporarily block the law creating the commission while the case proceeded on the merits .\nRepublicans had been challenging the new commission in two lawsuits that were consolidated into a single set of proceedings . One lawsuit argued that the new commission violated Republicans \u2019 First Amendment rights to free speech and association and their 14th Amendment right to equal protection because it imposes prohibitions on who may serve as a commissioner .\nRepublicans argued in the other lawsuit that the process for selecting commissioners violates the GOP \u2019 s First Amendment rights to freedom of association by preventing political parties from picking their own commissioners . The appeals court rejected both arguments by citing Supreme Court precedent enabling prohibitions on certain individuals serving on the commission , a decision the district court cited in its own ruling .\nThe Republican plaintiffs have not yet announced whether they will appeal but said they are considering their options .\n\u25cf New Jersey : Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey have introduced a constitutional amendment that would delay the implementation of new legislative districts from 2021 until 2023 and keep the current districts in place if the Census Bureau is unable to deliver the data from the 2020 census needed to draw new districts on time next year . The Trump administration has already told Congress that it doesn \u2019 t expect to be able to meet its early 2021 deadlines because of the pandemic and requested a new deadline of July 31 . The proposed amendment would come into effect if the census doesn \u2019 t certify New Jersey \u2019 s data by Feb. 15 .\nDemocrats hold the three-fifths supermajorities needed to put the amendment on the ballot without any GOP support , although voters would have to approve it in November for it to take effect . If no amendment passes , however , and the state is unable to meet its deadlines mandated under its constitution , it \u2019 s unclear what exactly would happen except that litigation would be a certainty .\nNew Jersey has a bipartisan redistricting commission appointed by legislative and state party leaders , and in past decades , a court-appointed tiebreaker has chosen between maps proposed by the two parties rather than draw their own lines . After the 2010 census , the tiebreaking member selected the Democratic proposal , leading the GOP to blast this proposed amendment as a power grab , although common statistical measures find no unfair advantage for Democrats under the current map .\n\u25cf District of Columbia : The D.C. Council has once again passed a bill to completely eliminate felony disenfranchisement as part of a larger package of police reforms , repealing and replacing the version it passed last month over what the lead sponsor called \u201c relatively minor tweaks , \u201d sending the latest legislation to Mayor Muriel Bowser for her expected signature .\nThe bill would immediately restore voting rights for several thousand citizens and would require officials to provide incarcerated citizens with registration forms and absentee ballots starting next year . However , because it is emergency legislation , it must be reauthorized after 90 days , though Council members plan to make it permanent soon .\nOnce Bowser signs the bill , D.C. would become only the third jurisdiction in the country after Maine and Vermont to maintain the right to vote for incarcerated citizens . It would also be the first place to do so with a large community of color : The District is 46 % African American , and more than 90 % of D.C. residents currently disenfranchised are Black .\n\u25cf Florida : Voting rights advocates have asked the Supreme Court to overturn a recent stay by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals of a lower court ruling that had struck down the Florida GOP \u2019 s poll tax on citizens who have served their felony sentences but owe court fines or fees . If it \u2019 s put back into effect , the district court \u2019 s ruling would pave the way for approximately 800,000 citizens who couldn \u2019 t pay off Florida \u2019 s predatory court costs to regain their voting rights , a group of citizens that is disproportionately Black .\nSeparately , the 11th Circuit scheduled a hearing on the merits of the case for Aug. 18 , the very same day as Florida \u2019 s statewide primary and nearly a month after the July 20 voter registration deadline for that election , ensuring that affected voters will be unable to vote in that election if the Supreme Court doesn \u2019 t intervene .\n\u25cf Minnesota : Minnesota officials have announced that they will not appeal a federal district court ruling from June that issued a preliminary injunction blocking a state law that would have listed Democrats last on the ballot in every partisan contest statewide in November after national Democrats sued . The court said that ballot order will be determined randomly for 2020 , though the state \u2019 s agreement with plaintiffs would give lawmakers a chance to change the law legislatively next year before the case proceeds further . As we \u2019 ve previously explained , being listed higher on the ballot can give candidates a modest boost , particularly in less-salient downballot races .\n\u25cf Indiana : Voting rights advocates have filed a federal lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of a law that Republicans passed in 2019 to prohibit voters , parties , and candidates from asking a court to keep polling locations open past 6 PM local time on Election Day if there are problems with voting . Under current law , only bipartisan county election boards can ask a court to extend polling hours , and only after a unanimous vote .\nThe plaintiffs argue that this law violates the First and 14th Amendments and has a disparate impact on Black and Latino voters . Alongside Kentucky , Indiana is the only state that closes its polls at 6 PM on Election Day ( all others close 7 PM or later ) , and this early closure makes it difficult to vote for people who work on Election Day or are caregivers for children or family members .\n\u25cf Iowa : Republican Gov . Kim Reynolds has signed a budget bill into law that makes Iowa \u2019 s voter ID regime more onerous and makes absentee voting more cumbersome for election officials to facilitate despite an expected surge in mail voting due to the pandemic .\nThe law adds a new requirement that voters present ID if they go to their county government offices to vote early in-person . A second provision requires absentee ballot applications to include the voter \u2019 s \u201c voter ID PIN , \u201d a state-issued four-digit number that few voters are likely aware of .\nIn addition , under the state \u2019 s previous laws , county officials could verify voter identities using other information on their applications or the state \u2019 s registration database , but this new law disallows that . Instead , officials would have to contact the voter individually to confirm their identity , which could cause significant delays in processing absentee requests and lead to voters not receiving their ballots in time to vote by mail .\n\u25cf Montana : A state court has issued a preliminary injunction blocking a GOP-supported law that makes it a crime for most Montanans to turn in another person \u2019 s absentee mail ballot , ruling in favor of the Native American advocates who brought a suit arguing that the statute violates the state constitution . The court had previously blocked the law on a short-term basis days before the June 2 primary , but this latest ruling suspends the law until the judge can issue a final ruling on the law , which may not happen until after November \u2019 s elections .\nThe law in question was approved by voters in 2018 after Republican legislators placed it on the ballot to circumvent a veto from Democratic Gov . Steve Bullock . It makes it a felony to turn in someone else \u2019 s absentee ballot unless the person doing so is the voter \u2019 s family member , caregiver , household member , or acquaintance , and even those individuals may turn in no more than six others \u2019 absentee ballots . Only postal workers and election officials are fully exempt .\nMontana is one of a few states that lets voters opt into permanently receiving an absentee mail ballot in all elections , which is intended to make it easier to vote . In addition , the pandemic prompted officials to mail every voter a ballot for the June 2 primary , and mail voting is likely to be very popular in November . However , because many Native Americans living on remote reservations lack reliable postal service and access to transportation , many ask others who do not face such barriers to turn in their ballots for them .\nRepublican state Attorney General Tim Fox and Secretary of State Corey Stapleton have not yet indicated whether they will appeal , though the lead GOP sponsor of the law said he hoped that they would .\n\u25cf Electoral College : On Monday , the U.S. Supreme Court rejected two legal challenges to the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting \u201c faithless electors \u201d in the Electoral College , ruling that states may enforce their laws that require the replacement of electors attempting to vote for a candidate other than the one whose slate they appeared on . Faithless elector bans are the law in 32 states and the District of Columbia , but only 15 states have provisions that actually enforce those bans by requiring faithless electors to be replaced with faithful ones .\nThe 10th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Colorado \u2019 s ban on faithless electors last year , but Washington \u2019 s Supreme Court upheld its state \u2019 s ban . The losers in both lawsuits had appealed to the Supreme Court , which ultimately upheld Washington \u2019 s ruling and overturned the case out of Colorado .\nSupporters of overturning faithless elector bans brought their cases in the hopes that victory would undermine public support for the Electoral College and lead to reforms abolishing it . However , justices such as Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh raised concern that doing so would \u201c lead to chaos \u201d and a \u201c massive campaign to try to influence electors \u201d in a close election , which could open the door to corruption , blackmail , and potentially the disenfranchisement of voters .\nAlthough the cases did not address the ongoing effort to reform the Electoral College by having states with a majority of electoral votes to pledge their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner , it may nevertheless neutralize one of the several potential legal threats to this project , known as National Popular Vote Interstate Compact . That \u2019 s because the court validated the notion that the Constitution grants the states sweeping authority to determine how they award their electors , although other potential constitutional challenges remain if the compact attains enough member states to enter into effect .\n\u25cf Mississippi : This fall , Mississippi voters will have their chance to repeal a provision of the state \u2019 s Jim Crow-era constitution that deliberately penalizes Black voters and the Democrats they support in elections for statewide office . However , the proposed change could end up replacing one major hurdle for Democratic candidates with another .\nLast week , Republican Gov . Tate Reeves signed a bill placing a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would change the way the state conducts elections by eliminating Mississippi \u2019 s version of the Electoral College , a key feature of the state \u2019 s 1890 constitution that proponents openly announced was enacted \u201c to secure to the State of Mississippi \u2018 white supremacy . ' \u201d\nThe provision in question requires candidates for statewide offices such as governor or attorney general to win not only a majority of the vote but also a majority of the state House \u2019 s 122 districts . If no candidate surpasses both thresholds , the members of the House choose the winner , and there \u2019 s nothing to stop them from picking the person who lost the popular vote .\nAfter Republicans took control of the legislature in 2011 , they redrew their own districts to guarantee they \u2019 d never lose their grip on power . They did so by making sure a majority of districts would be heavily white and , therefore , heavily Republican . As a result , they not only gerrymandered the state House , they gerrymandered every statewide election , too . The effect was so pronounced that in last year \u2019 s race for governor , which Democrat Jim Hood lost by 52-47 , Hood would likely have had to win by 15 points just to have a shot at carrying 62 House districts .\nThis proposed amendment would no longer require candidates for statewide office to carry a majority of the state House districts , but it would mandate a separate general election runoff if no candidate earned a majority of the vote . Georgia has had a similar runoff law on the books for years , and those runoffs have consistently seen turnout plummet and hurt Democratic candidates . If Mississippi Republicans wanted to ensure candidates are elected with majority support , they could instead replace the current system with instant-runoff voting or another preferential voting system that would eliminate the need for a separate runoff election .\nEven if this amendment fails to pass , it may not be the last word . Last year , a group of Black voters challenged this mini-Electoral College in federal court on the grounds that it violated the Constitution \u2019 s guarantee of one person , one vote . While the judge who heard the case agreed , he put the suit on hold to give lawmakers time to correct the problem themselves . If they fail to , the judge said , he \u2019 d allow litigants to once more pursue their claims .\nPlease bookmark our litigation tracker for a complete summary of the latest developments in every lawsuit regarding changes to elections and voting procedures as a result of the coronavirus .\n\u25cf Colorado : The Colorado Supreme Court , which has a 6-1 majority of Democratic appointees , has unanimously overturned Democratic Gov . Jared Polis \u2019 executive order that had allowed ballot initiative supporters to gather voter signatures by mail or email , siding with the business groups that brought the case and reinstating a requirement that signatures be witnessed in-person . This ruling may make it impossible for some measures to qualify for the ballot ahead of the Aug. 3 deadline to submit signatures .\n\u25cf Michigan : The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has refused to stay a district court ruling that required Michigan to either lower the number of signatures needed to put initiatives on November \u2019 s ballot or give supporters more time to gather them . The state has not yet indicated whether they will appeal the stay while the case proceeds on the merits .\n\u25cf New Hampshire : Advocates for blind voters have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that New Hampshire makes it impossible for them to exercise their right to vote a secret ballot using an absentee ballot . They want the court to require that New Hampshire let voters with such disabilities use the same absentee voting system available to military and overseas voters , which allows voters to fill out their ballots using a computer and print them out to mail them in .\n\u25cf New York : Civil rights advocates have filed a federal lawsuit objecting to New York \u2019 s procedures for rejecting absentee ballots . They aim to avoid a repeat of 2018 , when New York had the highest rate of rejected mail ballots in the country , with 14 % of such ballots invalidated . The plaintiffs are challenging how ballots with problems such as a signature either missing or not matching the one on file are rejected without notifying voters . They want the state to require that voters be alerted and given a chance to remedy the problem in a timely manner .\n\u25cf North Carolina : Voters who are suing North Carolina in state court to make it easier to vote absentee have amended their lawsuit to include a request for 21 extra days of in-person early voting . The case remains pending before a lower court .\nSeparately , the ACLU has filed a new lawsuit in state court to suspend the requirement that absentee voters have someone witness their ballot in-person . The GOP legislature with the support of Democrats passed a law earlier this year to require only one witness instead of two witnesses or a notary . However , even one required witness is more than most states mandate and has been waived by courts this year in other states with such requirements on their books .\n\u25cf Oregon : Redistricting reformers announced on Wednesday that they had failed to obtain enough signatures by the July 2 deadline to put an initiative on the November ballot that would establish an independent redistricting commission . However , their campaign isn \u2019 t over just yet thanks to a lawsuit that organizers filed in federal court shortly ahead of the deadline . The plaintiffs are asking the court to lower the number of signatures needed , which is currently about 150,000 , and for an extension of the deadline to submit them .\nReformers did not reveal how many signatures they had already submitted to the state , only saying it was in the \u201c tens of thousands. \u201d It \u2019 s unclear whether they will be able to meet the requirements if only one or the other of their two requests are granted and not both , since they lack the ability to obtain signatures electronically and instead have to direct supporters to an online form that must be printed out and mailed in to officials .\n\u25cf Pennsylvania : The Trump campaign and several Republican Congress members have filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to prohibit counties from setting up drop boxes or locations aside from the county board office for voters to return their absentee mail ballots . They also want to bar officials from counting mail ballots that aren \u2019 t placed in a secrecy envelope and allow Pennsylvanians to serve as poll watchers across the state regardless of which county they live in .\nThese provisions would add onerous burdens for mail voting access , and the measure on poll watchers in particular appears intended to encourage voter intimidation in urban communities of color in cities like Philadelphia . At one 2016 campaign rally , Trump listed several cities with large Black populations\u2014including Philadelphia\u2014and urged his supporters to volunteer as poll watchers in them .\n\u25cf Puerto Rico : Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party ( known by its Spanish acronym , PNP ) signed a bill into law making changes to Puerto Rico \u2019 s election code late last month only after lawmakers removed a contentious provision that would have enabled online voting for absentee voters this year and set the island on a path to transition entirely to universal online voting by 2028 . Lawmakers removed the provision after election security experts expressed alarm at the major risk of hacking with such a system .\nV\u00e1zquez \u2019 s party passed the final bill over the objections of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party , or PPD , which is the island \u2019 s other major party . The bill expanded early voting and eligibility for mail voting , but the PPD denounced it as a power grab . Opposition lawmakers claimed it would allow Puerto Ricans who \u2019 ve left the island for the mainland to vote absentee in an effort to bolster the PNP \u2019 s support , which has been hurt by scandals that culminated in V\u00e1zquez \u2019 s predecessor resigning last year .\n\u25cf South Carolina : South Carolina \u2019 s state Election Commission has announced that it will provide prepaid postage on all absentee ballots this year amid an ongoing federal lawsuit by Democrats seeking to ease access to absentee voting . Democrats are still challenging the requirement that voters must provide a valid excuse , which the GOP waived for the primaries but has left untouched for November .\n\u25cf Tennessee : Republican officials announced that they plan to enforce parts of a 2019 law restricting absentee voting eligibility despite a recent state court ruling that allows all voters to cast an absentee ballot due to concerns over COVID-19 . The law requires that newly registered voters who registered by mail , a voter registration drive , or public assistance offices must vote in-person the first time . Black voters in particular have been more likely to register through registration drives in recent years , exposing them to a disproportionate impact .\nRepublicans passed this restriction in 2019 in reaction to a 2018 surge in Black voter registrations . The law added criminal penalties to certain components of voter registration drives in an effort intended to make them all but impossible to conduct . While the GOP subsequently repealed some of those provisions regarding registration drives after a court ruling had curtailed them , other provisions of the law remain in effect , such as one that makes it a crime to pay workers based on the number of registrations they gather instead of paying them hourly or allowing them to volunteer .\nHowever , the GOP \u2019 s decision to enforce this in-person voting requirement for these registrants is not the final word , as the plaintiffs in the case that loosened the absentee voting restrictions are challenging this mandate as well . Republicans are currently appealing that ruling to the state Supreme Court , although the high court refused to stay the lower court \u2019 s decision while the appeal proceeds .", "The federal government is warning a former National Football League player 's company to stop advertising his medicinal cannabis products as treatments for the novel coronavirus .\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to that effect on Tuesday to the Las Vegas headquarters of Neuro XPF , which is owned by former NFL offensive tackle Kyle Turley . Turley insists that CBD , a popular non-psychoactive cannabis derivative , can cure the coronavirus .\nIn fact , Neuro XPF had an entire page of its website , headlined \u201c CRUSH CORONA , \u201d devoted to those claims . \u201c Your best defense against the COVID-19 blitz starts with a strong immune system , \u201d the page claimed , and \u201c a growing body of scientific evidence shows that CBD can help keep your immune system at the top of its game . \u201d\n\u201c We want everyone to take CBD and take advantage of its potential to help prepare your body to fight a coronavirus infection , \u201d Neuro XPF said . \u201c So , we \u2019 re making all of our products more affordable . \u201d\nThose claims quickly drew the ire of federal regulators that have cracked down of late on advertisements and scams hawking medically dubious coronavirus treatments .\n\u201c FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that , without approval or authorization by FDA , claim to mitigate , prevent , treat , diagnose , or cure COVID-19 in people , \u201d the agencies \u2019 joint letter advised . \u201c We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation , prevention , treatment , diagnosis , or cure of COVID-19 . \u201d\nA failure to comply , the agencies warned , \u201c may result in legal action , including , without limitation , seizure and injunction . \u201d\nIt appears that Turley \u2019 s company did , in the end , comply . The CRUSH CORONA page , which was active as late as March 29 , has since been taken down . The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\nIn his own public communications , Turley , a first-round 1998 NFL draft pick who spent much of his career with the Saints before retiring in 2007 , is adamant that his products are a coronavirus panacea . \u201c CBD CAN PREVENT AND CURE THE CORONA VIRUS ! \u201d he tweeted last month . He also insists that the drug cured his wife \u2019 s skin cancer .\nTurley has spurned colleagues in the recreational and medicinal cannabis industry who have criticized him for his outlandish claims about the products \u2019 medical benefits . Critics are \u201c scared to say too much because we don \u2019 t want the government , we don \u2019 t want the man , to start coming down on us , \u201d he told Marijuana Moment on Tuesday .\n\u201c Well guess what ? \u201d he added . \u201c I was a first round draft pick , I made millions of dollars , god saved my life through this plant and I live in America . So get used to it ... And I \u2019 m going to continue to spread his word . \u201d", "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump made yet another false claim about coronavirus testing on Wednesday , wrongly saying at a White House briefing that the US is conducting more tests than any governor probably even wants . In fact , numerous governors , including Republicans , have said that more testing is necessary .\nTrump also continued to embellish about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's February 24 visit to San Francisco 's Chinatown , inaccurately saying that she had held a Chinatown `` rally . '' He continued to insist that his travel restrictions on China were a `` ban , '' though they contained significant exemptions . And he threw in an old false claim about Michelle Obama for good measure .\nTrump bragged about the level of coronavirus testing in the US and played down criticism from medical professionals that there still is n't enough testing to get a handle of the pandemic .\n`` Ultimately , we 're doing more testing , I think , than probably any of the governors even want , '' Trump said , suggesting that his administration was leading the way on coronavirus testing .\nTrump later said that `` not everybody believes as strongly as some people on testing . '' And suggesting that calls for more testing are some sort of partisan plot , he claimed that `` some people want ( us ) to do testing because they think it 's impossible for us to fulfill that goal . ''\nFacts First : Trump is off the mark . There have been bipartisan calls from governors and medical professionals for the Trump administration to ramp up testing and give states the supplies they need to get it done . There is no evidence that calls for more tests are some sort of anti-Trump plot ; nonpartisan public health experts have said it 's critical for the government to significantly increase the level of testing as part of any plan to end social distancing and lift economic restrictions .\nEven as Trump shifts his rhetoric to reopening the country , governors from both parties say they need more testing or that they 're still struggling to obtain the testing materials they need . This includes Republican governors from Ohio , Nebraska , Maryland , Massachusetts , South Dakota and Wyoming\nDuring the same briefing on Wednesday , Surgeon General Jerome Adams , a Trump appointee who has been a strong defender of the President during the pandemic , acknowledged that `` many different groups '' have talked to the administration about testing , `` and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern . ''\nIt 's not clear who Trump is referring to when he says some `` not everybody believes as strongly as some people '' in testing . While skeptics certainly exist , there is a strong consensus among public health and elected officials that testing is pivotal . These views are shared by major business executives , doctors , and even some Trump appointees , including Dr. Scott Gottlieb , his former chief of the Food and Drug Administration .\nDuring Wednesday 's press briefing , Trump repeated a false claim he 's made numerous times about the travel restrictions imposed on China due to the coronavirus .\nHe once again described the restrictions as a `` ban '' and claimed that `` if we did n't close our country to China , we would have been so infected like nobody 's ever seen . ''\nFacts First : Trump 's comments are misleading because he did not `` close our country to China . '' On February 2 , the United States began Trump 's comments are misleading because he did not `` close our country to China . '' On February 2 , the United States began implementing travel restrictions that denied entry to foreign nationals who had visited China within 14 days of arrival in the United States . But the travel restrictions contain exemptions for US citizens who had visited China , which makes Trump 's characterization that there was a `` ban '' misleading .\nAs of February 2 , US citizens who had been in China 's Hubei province in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States are subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days upon their return to the US . American citizens returning from the rest of mainland China may also face up to 14 days of quarantine after undergoing health screenings at selected ports of entry .\nOnly foreign nationals who have visited China within the past 14 days are temporarily banned from entering the United States .\nDespite publicly disagreeing with Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp 's decision to open up businesses such as barbershops and tattoo parlors , Trump reiterated his past support for the governor . He compared his efforts to get Kemp elected with those of Democrats , erroneously claiming that Michelle Obama joined her husband in campaigning for Kemp 's opponent .\n`` As you know , Brian Kemp , governor of Georgia , I worked very hard for his election , he beat their superstar , he beat the superstar of their party . I think you can say I helped a lot , '' Trump said , `` Michelle Obama , Barack Obama , Oprah Winfrey they all went in , they campaigned for him very , very hard and he lost . ''\nFacts First : Michelle Obama did not campaign for either of Kemp 's opponents . Kemp beat Republican Lt. Gov . Casey Cagle , a man , in the primary and Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams , a woman , in the general election .\nWhile Trump 's comments make it unclear which of Kemp 's opponents he 's referring to specifically , he has claimed on multiple occasions that both the Obamas and Winfrey campaigned for Abrams . While Barack Obama and Winfrey did , Michelle Obama did not .\nTrump again exaggerated about Pelosi 's visit to San Francisco 's Chinatown on February 24 , this time claiming Pelosi was having a `` rally in San Francisco , in Chinatown .

But mixed in has been a torrent of misguided advice and inaccurate claims \u2013 including from supposedly scientific studies . This false information has amplified concerns in ways that have made it difficult to ascertain clearly the scope of the global health challenge and how best to address it .\nThe director-general of the World Health Organization has called on governments , companies , and news outlets around the globe to tackle an \u201c infodemic \u201d of fake news , which he characterized as being as dangerous as the coronavirus itself . The U.S. State Department \u2019 s foreign propaganda-busting center has compiled a report on some 2 million tweets spreading conspiracy theories about the epidemic , concluding that at least some of the activity was due to coordinated campaigns involving fake accounts , according to The Washington Post . And amid the swirl of dire predictions , a microbiology professor in Spain has deemed this a \u201c pandemic of fear . \u201d\nIndeed , fear and false information have gone viral . Everyone from data scientists and doctors to psychologists and pastors are weighing in on how to contain this infodemic and its attendant effects . Many see an opportunity for society and individuals to come out of this crisis the stronger for it .\n\u201c Sometimes a crisis can give us a lot of fear but it can also prompt us to think deeper and to think better , \u201d says Kristen Lee , a behavioral science professor at Northeastern University in Boston who cautions against \u201c hype contagion . \u201d\nTo avoid the sometimes paralyzing effects of fear , she advocates limiting social media consumption and finding opportunities to help others and live in a purpose-driven way . \u201c When we \u2019 re using our skills , resources , and capacities to contribute to the betterment of society , \u201d Dr. Lee says , \u201c that really is known to elevate and protect our well-being through times of difficulty . \u201d\nClaudio Furlan/LaPresse/AP People walk past a billboard reading `` Andra tutto bene , '' which is Italian for `` Everything will be alright , '' in Milan , Italy .

Those cures have included special toothpaste and potions , prompting a spoof from comedian John Oliver who offered \u201c Premium Werewolf Solution \u201d for $ 49.99 .\nOne of the challenges of combating false information is the underlying architecture of social media and the algorithms that drive it .\n\u201c What goes viral doesn \u2019 t have a lot to do with what \u2019 s true , it has to do with what \u2019 s shocking , \u201d says Professor Bergstrom , who commends social media companies for trying to prevent misinformation from spreading on their platforms . \u201c On the one hand , kudos to them for doing that . On the other hand , the problem exists in an ecosystem of their making . \u201d\nIn addition to the often well-intentioned sharing of unverified information that turns out to be false , another threat is organized disinformation campaigns designed to distract , distort , and deceive .\nWhen the crisis ramped up last week , there was a four- to five-day window in which official communication channels were relatively unfettered by such campaigns , says Marc Ambinder , a digital fellow at the University of Southern California studying disinformation and cybersecurity around elections . But , he adds , if the number of cases spikes , \u201c there \u2019 s going to be more anxiety , and the purveyors of disinformation in this arms race are going to regain their footing very quickly . \u201d\nThe Trump administration has alleged that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway to sow fear .

And , please , follow theorfor guidance on protecting your community from the disease .\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates is a rich man . He has put some of that wealth toward charitable organizations and initiatives through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . A primary focus of that foundation , and of Gates \u2019 philanthropy in general , is the reduction of inequalities in health outcomes , with a focus on the developing world . Via these organizations , he also funds research into technological solutions to public health problems in the poorest communities globally . Since 2015 , he has been raising alarms about the world \u2019 s potentially catastrophic lack of preparedness for a pandemic .\nIn part because of his advocacy for vaccines , Gates has also been a major recipient of the anti-vaccine movement \u2019 s vitriol for well over a decade . Years of manufactured animosity built by false claims from these anti-vaccine groups have , as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded , combined with the dubious claims of doomsday soothsayers and cryptocurrency Youtubers to create a sprawling COVID-19 conspiracy theory centered on Gates .\nThe basic allegation against Gates goes like this : He is using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to push a vaccine with a microchip capable of tracking you along with the rest of the world population .\nFrom a factual standpoint , Gates has never proposed or funded research into the development of a vaccine \u2014 for COVID-19 or for anything else \u2014 that includes the injection of a device that could actively track your location , monitor anything you are doing , or \u201c control \u201d you .\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a pilot study conducted by MIT and Rice University researchers into a potential vaccine-delivery device that could impart an invisible mark detectable by a smartphone . This study was theoretical , the technology described was passive , and the device was incapable of any sort of tracking or monitoring . Still , much of the credence lent to the false notion that Gates has designs to track you using vaccines comes from mixing the existence of that pilot study with another public health concept Gates is actively involved in researching called a \u201c digital identity . \u201d\nThe basic premise behind a digital ( or decentralized ) identity in the context of Gates \u2019 work is simple : It would involve some sort of cloud-based storage of medical and/or personal-identification documents accessible only with the consent of the owner but available anywhere in the world . Crucially , such a concept , whose central scientific challenges are in the realm of encryption and blockchains , has nothing to do with anything injected into the body . Despite this , conspiracy theorists falsely use Gates \u2019 support for digital identity initiatives as evidence of his intentions to build a vaccine-enabled surveillance state .\nAs someone who has funded general research into vaccines and pandemics , Gates has made several public statements on the present crisis . Broadly speaking , these statements reflect Gates \u2019 commitment to researching and developing both treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 , and to stressing the need for a scalable method to quickly identify people who have either recovered from COVID-19 or received a vaccination against it as a means to restart the global economy . For example , in an interview with Chris Anderson , who runs TED Talks , Gates indicated he believes some sort of \u201c immunity certificate \u201d will be instrumental in reopening the global economy :\nEventually what we \u2019 ll have to have is certificates of who \u2019 s a recovered person and who \u2019 s a vaccinated person , because you don \u2019 t want people moving around the world where you \u2019 ll have some countries that won \u2019 t have it under control . Sadly . You don \u2019 t want to completely block off the ability for those people to go there and come back and move around . So eventually there will be sort of this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up .\nIn a Reddit \u201c Ask Me Anything \u201d ( AMA ) discussion from March 2020 , Gates further detailed his views on disease surveillance in the United States :\nThe testing in the US is not organized yet . In the next few weeks I hope the government fixes this by having a website you can go to to find out about home testing and kiosks . Things are a bit confused on this right now . In Seattle , the [ University of Washington ] is providing thousands of tests per day but no one is connected to a national tracking system . Whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing .\nGates has praised the more extreme disease-surveillance measures taken by South Korea as a model for future pandemic preparedness . South Korea has had considerable success in limiting deaths from COVID-19 thanks in large part to aggressive \u201c contact tracing , \u201d described in an April 2020 report by the Brookings Institute :\nSouth Korea was effective in tracing people who may have come into contact with those who tested positive for COVID-19 . Nearly all South Korean citizens have smartphones and use credit cards , so when someone tests positive , the government can trace where they have been , at what time , and what mode of transportation they used . With this data , the government can trace the potentially infected population , using CCTV footage to identify potential contacts when needed . Those in close contact with the infected are asked to get tested , while indirect contacts are ordered to self-quarantine for fourteen days . This is an arduous process , but the South Korean government has maintained the ability to trace and contact potentially infected persons .\nThe theory that Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to track people based on any of these statements or views is flawed for at least two reasons . First , nothing he has advocated for above necessitates injecting a tracking device into a body . Instead these theoretical technologies would rely on a combination of biometric identification , encryption , and cloud storage of data . Second , as shown by South Korea , the injection of tracking devices via vaccines would likely be a waste of time , given the fact that most of humanity is constantly connected to a GPS enabled smartphone that probably knows more about you than your parents .\nThe sole bit of evidence used to suggest Bill Gates \u2019 interest in adding anything that resembles a microchip in vaccines stems from his foundation \u2019 s funding of a study , published in Science Translational Medicine in December 2019 , that \u201c developed dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin \u201d that can , when exposed to certain frequencies of light , \u201c identify the immunization status of infants. \u201d In several developing countries , a lack of reliable immunization records can , the authors argued , affect the quality of care provided .\nThe study \u2014 which was not conducted on human subjects \u2014 did not describe the injection of a \u201c microchip \u201d co-administered with a vaccine . Instead , it described the use of something referred to as a quantum dot . These dots are essentially molecule-sized particles engineered to have unique structures that react to near-infrared light in a way that could theoretically be identified by a device such as a smartphone . It is physically impossible to implant a quantum dot sized device that could actively ping location or any other data to an unknown third party .\nFurther , this sort of research \u2014 if it ever came to fruition in the first place \u2014 is in its infancy , and would be years away from actual implementation anywhere , let alone in a potential COVID-19 vaccine that scientists estimate could be available potentially within 18 months . Nonetheless , this study is crucial to the conspiracy theory , as that narrative is dependent on conflating quantum dots with Gates \u2019 work in digital identities . That \u2019 s why it is important to understand the misrepresentations made of the Gates-funded group ID2020 .\nID2020 , or the Digital Identity Alliance , is a 501c3 non-profit funded by a diverse range of foundations and corporate sponsors \u2014 including Microsoft and the Gates-funded vaccine non-profit GAVI \u2014 that provides grants for practical research into the real-world application of digital identities :\nThe ID2020 Alliance provides funding and other forms of material support for high-impact and high-quality digital identity projects that are privacy-protecting , user-centric , and designed for scale , impact , and replicability . Proposals are accepted on a rolling basis at various stages of development . Any individual or organization meeting the required application and evaluation criteria is welcome to submit a proposal .\nSeveral of the projects funded by ID2020 have been characterized by anti-vaccine activists as using the poor and vulnerable as scientific guinea pigs involving the implantation of a device that infringes on their privacy . Outside of the fact that none of these projects involve injecting subjects with anything , the philosophical premise implied by such claims is also in direct opposition to what ID2020 seeks to accomplish . Its goal , however lofty , is to develop a system in which the individual has complete control over personal identification or health documentation . The end product would be a system that allows this sort of information to be accessible anywhere in the world but only with your consent . The ID2020 manifesto makes this explicit :\nOver 1 billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means . As such , they are without the protection of law , and are unable to access basic services , participate as a citizen or voter , or transact in the modern economy . \u2026 We believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities , including how personal data is collected , used , and shared . Everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders , and across time . Privacy , portability , and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals .\nOne pilot project funded by ID2020 is MyPass , which is an effort to provide digital identification to the homeless population of Austin , Texas . The project , still in its infancy , seeks to create an online , cloud-based repository of identification and medical documents . Early versions of the pilot study would likely use some combination of a QR code card given to participating individuals , but future work could involve biometrics like fingerprints or IRIS scans . Importantly , the participants in the study volunteered to be in it , can opt out at any time , and did not and will not have anything injected into them . Another project , currently active in Bangladesh and Tanzania , seeks to test the viability of tying infant fingerprints to digital identities .\nThese projects are small pilot studies with limited relevance to the current COVID-19 pandemic , and none of them involves injecting anything into anyone , let alone something that would contain the functionality that would enable any sort of active tracking or surveillance . Still , conspiracy theorists have pushed the above facts into an unfounded but paranoid narrative .\nAs stated above , Bill Gates has been interested in using vaccines to combat health inequalities for over a decade . Though it has no relevance to the claims at issue for COVID-19 , the assertion that Bill Gates \u2019 interest in vaccines stems from a goal of \u201c depopulating \u201d the world is almost universally included as part of that narrative as a means to imbue Gate \u2019 s actions with nefarious intent . That false conclusion stems from a grotesque misreading of Gates \u2019 argument that communities with access to vaccination tend to have lower birth rates because reduced childhood mortality means more children will survive into adulthood .\nAs also discussed above : Gates has been interested in , and financially supportive of , the concept of digital identification as another means of reducing health inequality globally . The narrative pushed by conspiracy theorists involves conflating the concept of a digital identification with the injection of a device . For example , appearing in an interview by far-right Christian conspiracy theorist Rick Wiles \u2019 on his TruNews platform , a guest asserted without evidence that both concepts were directly related :\nWhat Bill Gates said was eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered , who has been tested \u2026 and we will have [ a record of who ] received [ a COVID-19 ] through that digital certificate . Now that digital certificate might just sound like something simple . Maybe it \u2019 s a computer document . That \u2019 s not exactly what \u2019 s going on here . \u2026 . This project has researchers at MIT and Rice University with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation working to create that digital certificate system . It \u2019 s going to be a chip that actually is implanted into humans .\nAs previously explained , the MIT/Rice study was not conducted by the ID2020 alliance , and ID2020-funded projects are not experimenting with injecting things into people . Natural News , a supplement store and alternative health conspiracy blog , similarly conflated digital identity with quantum dot technology to portray Gates as an agent of Satan :\nKeep in mind that this all coincides with the ID2020 agenda , which aims to create a global digital identification system for every person on Earth . As we \u2019 ve reported in the past , ID2020 and vaccines are being used together to harvest the biometric identities of all mankind , and all for the purpose of creating the global system of tracking and control that was foretold in the book of Revelation . They \u2019 ve already begun to test ID2020 in Bangladesh , inserting digital IDs in the bodies of newborn babies along with their vaccinations . And Bill Gates is now talking about how so-called \u201c quantum dot tattoos \u201d are the next wave of biometrics identification , also to be inserted in people \u2019 s bodies through vaccination .\nIgnoring the fact that ID2020 is not a product capable of being \u201c tested , \u201d the Bangladesh project Natural News references here does not involve dead babies , nor does it involve the \u201c insertion \u201d of anything into anyone . It \u2019 s an exercise in imaging infant fingerprints .\nIn sum , the contention that Gates is using COVID-19 as a pretense to inject monitoring devices into humans relies on a misrepresentation of the research he has funded , the methods those projects have employed , and confusion over what a \u201c digital identity \u201d seeks to achieve . If and when a vaccine for COVID-19 comes , it will not be capable of tracking your movements or reporting any data to any entity whatsoever . None of the technology discussed by Gates here is even capable of such a task .\nPandemics are global catastrophes with few easy answers . Gates , a private citizen with no ability to mandate policy or govern international health organizations , has spent over a decade funding research into various strategies that could mitigate their effect . His ideas , though supported by many scientists , are not decrees . Instead , his focus has been on understanding the likely viability and efficacy of various counter-pandemic and public health strategies . These initiatives have been blended into a false narrative involving an as-yet-undeveloped COVID-19 vaccine combined with a made-up microchip device unlike anything Gates has ever been involved in . As such , the claim that Gates is planning to microchip you via a COVID-19 vaccination is false .", "There 's a long way to go , but the Covington Kids have struck the first blow in returning accountability to news media .\nA year after he and his family 's name was dragged through the mud by a social media mob , egged on by fake news , Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann has secured a settlement of his defamation lawsuit against CNN . I hope it 's a big one . He deserves it . And CNN deserves the hit .\nFar too many journalists in this country are interested not in reporting the news or providing honest commentary , but in creating inflammatory incidents to `` start a national conversation , '' or far worse , to sadistically humiliate private citizens they perceive to be their enemies .\nBoth problematic impulses were on display when `` Black Hebrew Israelites '' and a professional protester pretending to be a Vietnam veteran confronted a group of Catholic high school students from Covington , Kentucky , last January .\nIf there was a news story to report , it was the brazen aggression of the openly anti-Semitic Black Hebrew Israelites , who chose to scream racist and anti-Catholic slurs at the boys , who had just participated in the March for Life . Less than a year later , two associates of that very group would open fire in a kosher grocery in Jersey City , N.J. , killing three people . Any journalist could have had a scoop on a rising , violent threat to Jewish-Americans that the Covington incident foreshadowed .\nBut that was n't the story the media wanted to tell . It was n't the `` conversation '' they wanted to start . The story they wanted to tell was about white Catholic kids `` harassing '' black activists and peace-loving Native Americans . So that 's what they did , heedlessly embracing that biased impulse . They put 16 year-old student Nick Sandmann 's face front and center of their reporting , claiming his `` smirking face '' made him a racist thug .\nSome of the more dishonest participants in this pile-on would claim they were `` just reporting the facts , '' but others let their guard down and more or less admitted they wanted to mess this kid 's life up because he wore a MAGA hat . I wrote about this at length as soon as the real facts came out : Sandmann and the Covington Catholic students did nothing wrong . They were the victims of a set-up by leftist activists and it fit the media 's biases so well they bought the rouse hook , line , and sinker .\nThis is how the modern American media operates far too much of the time , driven by ideology and hatred of people they think are different . And for far too long , they 've done so with virtual impunity . Defamation suits against the news media are expensive and difficult to win . Because of the free press ' role in preserving our democratic traditions , courts are often exceedingly deferential to reporters , even when they get the most important facts wrong .\nThe news that CNN agreed to settle with Sandmann for an undisclosed amount should have serious ramifications in the news industry . If the mainstream media were the professionals they claim to be , they would n't threaten the lives and reputations of ordinary Americans with their libels .\nBut this is the American fake news media we 're talking about . They 've got a long , steep climb ahead before they regain any respectability .\nDonald Trump Jr. is the executive vice president at The Trump Organization and author of the New York Times bestseller `` Triggered : How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us .

Wochit\nTexas state troopers have begun asking motorists their race and ethnicity after it was discovered that drivers \u2014 mostly Hispanics \u2014 were often misidentified during traffic stops because of flaws in an automated system meant to guard against racial profiling .\nDepartment of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw told a state House committee that the change took effect Wednesday in an attempt to gather more accurate data .\n`` What we can do better , and what we should have been doing better , is collect the data accurately as it relates to Hispanics . Plain and simple ... I would rather a trooper not have to ask , '' McCraw told lawmakers , according to a transcript of the hearing . `` But if the data does n't work ... there is a problem . ''\nKXAN-TV in Austin conducted a database review using millions of records going back to 2010 that showed troopers across the state inaccurately reported the race of Hispanic drivers .\nThe television station 's investigation of DPS traffic citation records also found the number of drivers stopped by troopers and recorded as Hispanic has gone up annually since 2010 \u2014 from nearly 208,000 to 351,000 last year \u2014 while the number of drivers recorded as white declined in the same time period from 1.9 million to about 1.2 million last year , the Associated Press reported .\nAmong the most common surnames of drivers listed by troopers as white are Garcia , Martinez , Hernandez , Gonzalez and Rodriguez . While a Hispanic name does n't necessarily mean a person is of Hispanic descent , the review of DPS records showed more than 1.9 million drivers with traditionally Hispanic names were listed as white . Over the same period , approximately 1.6 million were reported as Hispanic .\nIn an effort to guard against racial profiling , state law requires authorities to document the race of drivers who are arrested , issued warnings or citations . But McCraw testified that coding on drivers licenses only allowed for identification as Hispanic since 2010 . Prior to that time , Hispanic motorists were often identified as white .\nMcCraw told lawmakers that he did not know how much it would cost to fix the automated system , leaving no other remedy but to direct troopers to specifically ask for the information .\n`` Officers will advise the individual that the officer is required by law to inquire as to the individual \u2019 s race or ethnicity , '' a DPS memo outlining the new policy stated . `` The officer will record the race or ethnicity as stated by the motorist . Only in cases where an individual refuses to provide the requested information and the database reflects their race or ethnicity as 'other , ' will the officer use best judgment or ability to determine the race or ethnicity of the motorists . ''\nDespite the current lack of data , McCraw maintained that the agency does not tolerate racial profiling .\n`` Bottom line , it 's against the law , '' he said . `` There is no racial profiling within the DPS . ''", "In the fall of 2015 , a maximum-security prison in New York invited Harvard \u2019 s debate team to compete against a squad of three incarcerated men . The men , all convicted of violent crimes , knew they faced tough odds : Unlike their Harvard opponents , they could not use the internet to study the topic in advance . But the prisoners were declared the winners , and the crowd , including dozens of other incarcerated men in green jumpsuits , burst into applause .\nThe incarcerated debaters at Eastern New York Correctional Facility were students themselves , part of an undergraduate program run by Bard College . The Bard Prison Initiative gives a small group of prisoners access to the same professors and curriculum offered to students on the regular liberal arts campus , allowing them to earn bachelor \u2019 s degrees . \u201c BPI is a simple experiment , \u201d Max Kenner , the program \u2019 s founder , says in College Behind Bars , a new documentary series directed by Lynn Novick , produced by Sarah Botstein , and executive produced by Ken Burns . \u201c What happens when we provide the kinds of education that are typically in the US only afforded to the wealthy or lucky or rich , to others ? \u201d\nWhat happens is more than just beating Harvard ( or Cambridge ) at debate . \u201c We were blown away by the seriousness and intellectual sophistication and curiosity and the focus and collegiality and the way the students talked with us and to each other and raised really profound challenging questions that we had never been asked , \u201d says Novick , who herself taught a Bard class about film before beginning the documentary . Graduates of the program are also much less likely to commit other crimes later . Only 4 percent of them have wound up in prison again , compared with about 40 percent of other New York prisoners .\nIf only more people could take advantage of the opportunity . Prison college programs used to be fairly common , but the 1994 crime bill written by Joe Biden and signed by Bill Clinton gutted federal funding for them . By 2001 , when the Bard program began , only three other programs in New York offered higher education behind bars . Today , the documentary series shows that less than 2 percent of incarcerated people in the state \u2019 s prisons have access to higher education .\nThis week , I caught up with Sebastian Yoon , one of the students portrayed in the film . Incarcerated at the age of 16 , he spent the first part of a 15-year sentence sweeping floors and wishing he could go off to college like his friends on the outside . At one point , he became so desperate he tried to kill himself . But the Bard program changed his outlook , and he threw himself into pursuing a degree in social studies . In one of the final segments of the series , he holds back tears after receiving an A on his senior thesis . \u201c I want to go home and I want to look back at prison and say , \u2018 Prison was terrible , I never want to go back , but I learned something , ' \u201d he says afterward . \u201c That is where transformation happens . That is what stops people from coming back to prison . \u201d\nYoon was recently released . Here , he shares what it was like to go through Bard , the challenges of studying in a cell , and how a college program transformed the maximum-security prison where he lived .\nCan you tell me a little about what your life was like growing up , and how you arrived at Eastern Correctional Facility ?\nI grew up without a mother , who left me when I was five . My father and my two siblings , we were together , and then I went to Korea for about two years when I was five . We came back to Flushing , Queens , and moved to Long Island when I was 10 , and it was there that I found myself being one of few Asians in the entire school . I faced a lot of discrimination and racism . I didn \u2019 t know how to respond ; all I could do was go home and pretty much cry . There was one time when I just snapped and reacted violently . From then on , I realized people stopped bothering you when you used force . I started hanging out in the streets , where I found a sense of empowerment . One night , me and my friends were hanging out at a karaoke bar , and a fight erupted , which wasn \u2019 t unusual for us . But this case obviously changed my life : At the age of 16 , I was sentenced to 15 years for manslaughter in the first degree , as an adult . Because at the time , teenagers were still charged as adults in New York state . And then I landed at Eastern , five years after I was incarcerated .\nDo you remember what your first day of class was like and how you felt ?\nWhen I first started class , I was very skeptical . I mean , I was interested and excited to be a part of it , and to have gotten accepted , but I was skeptical . Because generally programs within prisons are dumbed down , and nobody cares , not even the people who are teaching . The greatest surprise to me was how engaged and passionate the professors were . They didn \u2019 t treat us as prisoners or make the curriculum easy for us in any way .\nMost of my work happened in my cell late at night . Usually people start going to sleep at 11 , but for us college students , sleep time was usually around 3 a.m. , because the quietest time to study was after midnight . You don \u2019 t want to leave the lights on in the cell because it \u2019 s an open cell and it would bother people . So we would just turn on the lamps and read for hours on end and write essays . When you look out the window , the cells that you see with the lamps reflecting , they were usually college students .\nThe film mentions how studying would get interrupted regularly for the count\u2014when all the guys would have to go back to their cells to be counted by correctional officers . What were some of the other challenges that made it hard to be a student in prison ?\nJust being a prisoner , that in itself was probably the biggest struggle . No matter how hard you try to be a student , you are first and foremost a prisoner . The only way to fight it was to just get lost in the ideas and the books and discussions .\nWithout access to the internet , how would you do research ?\nMost of our research came through books . But we did have a non-online internet , called JSTOR . So we would type up a subject title , and we would see only the titles of the articles . Based on the titles , we could submit request forms , and there is a faculty member for BPI who , along with a team of Bard college students on [ the main Bard campus ] , would print these papers out and bring them into the prison .\nIn the series , one student talks about how he was put into solitary confinement after writing a story for homework that included characters who swore during the dialogue . Were there other examples of students being punished for doing their work ?\nNot for doing homework , per se . But I \u2019 ve seen some instances where students got a ticket for having passed the book limit in their cells . In New York , I think the max is 15 books per cell . In a given semester , if you \u2019 re taking four to five classes , you \u2019 re going to receive more than 20 books . And you have to also include the personal books you have . Some officers are understanding , but there are some officers who would give you a ticket . Something like that was very frustrating . But what can we do ? We took the risk . Books were more important .\nSome of the guys in the documentary describe the Bard program as a way to escape mentally from the confines of prison , and one says it \u2019 s a sort of an \u201c oasis\u2026in the desert. \u201d Is that how you saw it ?\nWell for me , I have to say that this program gave me life in the literal sense . Because when I first went to prison , I tried to commit suicide upon receiving 15 years . And I was desperate to find a reason to live . I was desperate for hope , because all I could imagine was upon being released that nobody would ever give me an opportunity because I \u2019 m a convicted criminal , and they would see me as a 16-year-old who committed an act\u2014not define me as a person who committed a bad act , but define me as a bad person . In a place like prison , once you \u2019 re given even a glimmer of hope , you \u2019 re just going to latch onto it . And higher education materialized in a form of hope . And I was just gung-ho all the way . Nothing else mattered .\nI used to tell my dad that finishing my senior thesis comes before being released . Like I wanted to finish that paper , that \u2019 s how important it was to me .\nAbout how Koreans living in Korea and Korean Americans here look back on Japanese colonialism , which happened in the 20th century in Korea , and how they used that history to define their identities .\nHow were you spending most of your time before you decided to apply for BPI ?\nIn the beginning , I swept and mopped the school floors . After that I went to work as a cook in the officers \u2019 mess hall . So instead of making food for the inmates , I made food for the officers .\nI was 21 at the time I was accepted into BPI . During that time , my friends who were outside would tell me about what they were doing in college , what kind of courses they were taking . I felt a deep sense of shame and despair thinking that while my friends were doing what every 20-year-old should be doing , I \u2019 m sitting here staring at my wall for hours on end . And I \u2019 m making no improvements for my life , and my prospects for the future weren \u2019 t getting any brighter .\nSome correctional officers never got a college degree themselves . Did this ever lead to tension with students who were pursuing their degree while they were incarcerated ?\nSome officers would say something like , \u201c Just because you \u2019 re getting an education don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re better than me , or don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re smarter than me. \u201d But there were also officers who encouraged us . It would really make my day whenever an officer searching my cell would ask about a paper that was sitting at my desk . \u201c What are you learning now ? I hope you guys graduate soon . I wish I could be there . If I could I will. \u201d That was very encouraging for all of us .\nOh , graduation was the highlight of my incarceration . It was a time when all the hard work that we \u2019 d put in was finally showcased . It was a testament to the fact that despite the difficulties , despite the hopelessness , we \u2019 d accomplished something . For my father , that became a talking point . As a parent , I guess when you \u2019 re having conversations with someone , it \u2019 s difficult to say , \u201c My son or daughter is in prison. \u201d Getting my degree , my dad could talk about me with a sense of pride , not in shame . He would say , \u201c My son is incarcerated , but he \u2019 s getting a college education. \u201d He was very proud that day .\nWas there a particular book or class that made a big impression or changed your worldview ?\nMy favorite class was called Cosmopolitanism . We talked about what it would like to have world citizenship , whereby our identities are not limited by nationalities , but where we are global members of the world . It taught me what it meant to have civic duty and to have civic virtues . I thought civic duties was limited to obeying laws , but that changed , and I realized that being a democratic person requires one to actively participate in the political process . I think it carries with me even up to this day . I \u2019 m constantly reading the news . I want to know what \u2019 s going on not only in the US , but in the world . And I want to be part of a change . And I \u2019 m gon na vote , which is something we couldn \u2019 t do in prison .\nWhat are some of the ways that this Bard program changed Eastern as a facility ?\nIt changes the atmosphere . If you ever visited , you would not see anything similar to what you would see in Hollywood shows or these documentaries that like to show prisoners acting irrationally and violently all the time . You would see incarcerated people walking around with textbooks in the yard , having conversations about philosophy and Plato . It pervades throughout the general population , the people who are not in the program : When they see us having a discussion , often they would come over and ask what we were talking about . The next thing we know , they were part of the conversation and we were able to teach them , but also we were able to listen to them . Which makes them feel like they want to continue this kind of thing and join BPI also .\nWhen did you leave prison , and where are you now ?\nI was released from prison in March . I \u2019 m currently working as a program specialist with the Democracy Fund at Open Society Foundations , which is the second-biggest philanthropic organization in the world . We provide grants and support to other organizations and individuals who are committed to social justice reform work . I \u2019 m still in Long Island , but I work in Manhattan .\nI live with my family , and it \u2019 s great . I \u2019 m helping to pay the mortgage , I \u2019 m able to do familial duties , to help my little sister with her homework . She \u2019 s in high school right now . She \u2019 s actually 16 , which is the age I went to prison . Just looking at her reminds me how young I was . Because she seems like a baby to me . But yeah , life is really interesting , and I \u2019 m very optimistic for my future . And just being part of an organization that is about helping others , especially those who are marginalized , I mean , I wake up feeling really good about the coming day .\nThe series College Behind Bars aired on PBS on November 25 and 26 and is now available for free streaming on PBS.org through the end of January .", "`` Desperate Housewives '' star Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for federal crimes stemming from the massive `` Varsity Blues '' college entrance scam .\nInterested in College Admissions Scandal ?

She was on the board of that company when she was a state senator , raising questions about self-dealing \u2014 and even about the existence of the books , which feature a young black girl who touts the benefits of nutrition and exercise . After Pugh was paid , thousands of books apparently were never delivered .\nThe 11-count federal indictment made public Wednesday reveals a fuller picture of what the government says was a scheme in which she collected payments from the books to line her own pocket , donate to her own political campaign and even buy a house . At the same time , authorities say , customers waited around for Healthy Holly books that never arrived .\nPugh now stands accused of federal crimes including multiple counts of wire fraud , conspiracy to defraud the United States and tax evasion .\n`` Fraud and corruption of the sort we are addressing today undermine the public 's faith in public officials , '' Robert Hur , U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland , told reporters Wednesday in Baltimore . `` This is a tragedy and the last thing that our city needs . ''\nProsecutors also announced that two of Pugh 's associates , former city employees Gary Brown Jr. and Roslyn Wedington , have accepted plea deals .\nBrown , 38 , admitted to crimes including wire fraud for cashing checks that he said Pugh wrote to him for the children 's books , then using the money to pay down Pugh 's debt and make political donations to her . Prosecutors say Brown then tried to cover the ruse by filing false documents to the Internal Revenue Service .\nPugh and Brown , according to the indictment , secretly moved tens of thousands of dollars from the book sales to her political campaign under other peoples ' names \u2014 what prosecutors call `` straw donations '' \u2014 in an alleged attempt to make it appear as if the money was flowing from other sources .\nWedington , 50 , accepted a plea bargain from the government in a separate ploy in which she dodged federal taxes and then attempted to conceal it . Brown admitted that he assisted in this scheme .\n`` Corrupt public employees rip off the taxpayers and undermine everyone 's faith in government , '' Hur said in a statement .\nIf convicted , prosecutors said Pugh could face lengthy prison time . Authorities are also seeking to recover some $ 769,000 in profits from the alleged fraudulent book sales .\nProsecutors said in the indictment that they might try to seize her home in a wealthy section of northwest Baltimore that authorities allege was purchased and renovated with ill-gotten profits .\nPugh is expected to turn herself in to U.S . Marshals ahead of an expected court appearance and arraignment on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Deborah Chasanow . She is expected to enter a plea of not guilty .\nPugh 's lawyer , Steven Silverman , declined to comment , telling NPR that he `` will address this matter in open court tomorrow . ''\nIn late April , the FBI and IRS raided Pugh 's home as part of the federal investigation into the children 's book scandal first exposed by The Baltimore Sun .\nA week later , her resignation was announced at an event in which she was not present . In her absence , Silverman read a statement in which Pugh apologized for `` the harm I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor . ''\nPugh has been in self-imposed seclusion in her home following an initial leave of absence she claimed was over a bout of pneumonia .", "Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh is facing federal charges related to what prosecutors say was a plot to enrich herself through sales of her self-published children \u2019 s book series , according to a grand jury indictment made public Wednesday .\nPugh , 69 , is expected to self-surrender to U.S . Marshals Thursday before her first court appearance before U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow , according to a news release .\nThe former mayor , who resigned her post in May amid the book sale controversy , is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud , seven counts of wire fraud , conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of tax evasion . The indictment was returned Nov. 14 .\nBALTIMORE MAYOR INSISTS LEADERSHIP IS NOT TO BLAME FOR HOMICIDE RATE\nProsecutors say Pugh , who became Baltimore 's 50th mayor on Dec. 6 , 2016 , used her `` Healthy Holly '' book series in order to fund her lifestyle in addition to her political campaign and political interests . She allegedly bought a house and paid down personal debt with the profits , according to The Baltimore Sun .\nREPUBLICAN SEEKING ELIJAH CUMMINGS ' HOUSE SEAT : MANY BALTIMORE RESIDENTS AGREE WITH TRUMP\nThe book scheme allegedly involved Pugh failing to print thousands of copies or double-selling titles in the series , the Sun reported . Prosecutors also allege Pugh listed her 2016 income as $ 31,000 when it actually exceeded $ 322,000 .\nIn April , Pugh announced she was taking an indefinite leave of absence after she had been `` advised by her physicians that she needs to take time to recover and focus on her health . '' She said she felt like she was n't able to fulfill her obligations as mayor because of her deteriorating health brought on by a recent case of pneumonia .\nUltimately , Pugh resigned amid state and federal investigations about her book series , and apologized `` for the harm that I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and to the credibility of the office of the mayor . ''\nPugh was the third Baltimore mayor to face sustained calls to resign . Bernard `` Jack '' Young took her place .\nFormer Baltimore city employees Gary Brown Jr. and Roslyn Wedington pleaded guilty to related charges , it was also revealed Wednesday .", "Many years ago , I was a member of a committee that was recommending to whom grant money should be awarded . Since I knew one of the applicants , I asked if this meant that I should recuse myself from voting on his application .\n`` No , '' the chairman said . `` I know him too -- and he is one of the truly great phonies of our time . ''\nThe man was indeed a very talented phony . He could convince almost anybody of almost anything -- provided that they were not already knowledgeable about the subject .\nHe had once spoken to me very authoritatively about Marxian economics , apparently unaware that I was one of the few people who had read all three volumes of Marx 's `` Capital , '' and had published articles on Marxian economics in scholarly journals .\nWhat our glib talker was saying might have seemed impressive to someone who had never read `` Capital , '' as most people have not . But it was complete nonsense to me .\nIncidentally , he did not get the grant he applied for .\nThis episode came back to me recently , as I read an incisive column by Charles Krauthammer , citing some of the many gaffes in public statements by the President of the United States .\nOne presidential gaffe in particular gives the flavor , and suggests the reason , for many others . It involved the Falkland Islands .\nArgentina has recently been demanding that Britain return the Falkland Islands , which have been occupied by Britons for nearly two centuries . In 1982 , Argentina seized these islands by force , only to have British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher take the islands back by force .\nWith Argentina today beset by domestic problems , demanding the return of the Falklands is once again a way for Argentina 's government to distract the Argentine public 's attention from the country 's economic and other woes .\nBecause the Argentines call these islands `` the Malvinas , '' rather than `` the Falklands , '' Barack Obama decided to use the Argentine term . But he referred to them as `` the Maldives . ''\nIt so happens that the Maldives are thousands of miles away from the Malvinas . The former are in the Indian Ocean , while the latter are in the South Atlantic .\nNor is this the only gross misstatement that President Obama has gotten away with , thanks to the mainstream media , which sees no evil , hears no evil and speaks no evil when it comes to Obama .\nThe presidential gaffe that struck me when I heard it was Barack Obama 's reference to a military corps as a military `` corpse . '' He is obviously a man who is used to sounding off about things he has paid little or no attention to in the past . His mispronunciation of a common military term was especially revealing to someone who was once in the Marine Corps , not Marine `` corpse . ''\nLike other truly talented phonies , Barack Obama concentrates his skills on the effect of his words on other people -- most of whom do not have the time to become knowledgeable about the things he is talking about . Whether what he says bears any relationship to the facts is politically irrelevant .\nA talented con man , or a slick politician , does not waste his time trying to convince knowledgeable skeptics . His job is to keep the true believers believing . He is not going to convince the others anyway .\nBack during Barack Obama 's first year in office , he kept repeating , with great apparent earnestness , that there were `` shovel-ready '' projects that would quickly provide many much-needed jobs , if only his spending plans were approved by Congress .\nHe seemed very convincing -- if you did n't know how long it can take for any construction project to get started , after going through a bureaucratic maze of environmental impact studies , zoning commission rulings and other procedures that can delay even the smallest and simplest project for years .\nOnly about a year or so after his big spending programs were approved by Congress , Barack Obama himself laughed at how slowly everything was going on his supposedly `` shovel-ready '' projects .\nOne wonders how he will laugh when all his golden promises about ObamaCare turn out to be false and a medical disaster . Or when his foreign policy fiascoes in the Middle East are climaxed by a nuclear Iran .", "\u201c Do I think he \u2019 s a civil rights leader ? No , \u201d said Al Sharpton . Obama and King\nOn this , black civil rights leaders agree : President Barack Obama isn \u2019 t the second coming of Martin Luther King Jr .\nIt \u2019 s tempting to compare the two men \u2013 \u201c inevitable , \u201d the New York Times said this week \u2013 but allies and some critics in the black community say Obama is not the leader of a movement . Instead , Obama is playing a different role in a different time .\n\u201c Do I think he \u2019 s a civil rights leader ? No , \u201d said Al Sharpton , who has become close to Obama in part because they are of the same post-movement generation . \u201c I think he \u2019 d be the first person to tell you that . \u201d\nSo when Obama settles into King \u2019 s footsteps at the base of the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday , half a century after the 1963 March on Washington , black leaders will be listening not for the inspirational rhetoric of a civil rights icon but for the substance of a president .\n\u201c Those are two different roles , \u201d said Jesse Jackson , who has had his differences with Obama . \u201c What we needed from Dr. King was motivation and vision . What we need from the president is appropriation and legislation . \u201d\nIn other words , Obama is more Kennedy than King . Obama \u2019 s background is in organizing but he never promised or sought to be a King-style leader . Indeed , of all the things King envisioned in his famous refrain \u2014 \u201c I have a dream\u2026 \u201d \u2014 a black president was not one of them . In that way , Obama is blazing a trail that wasn \u2019 t publicly contemplated when the original civil rights generation pressured presidents to secure access to public accommodations , voting booths , and housing .\n\u201c The Civil Rights Movement is what created the opportunity to pave the way for the United States to be able to elect the first African American president , \u201d said Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett . \u201c So , he stands on the shoulders of those who paved the way , but he also recognizes that as president of the United States he has an enormous responsibility as well to continue \u2013 to use Martin Luther King \u2019 s words \u2013 moving the arc of the moral universe , to bend it toward justice . \u201d\n( Also on POLITCO : Race against time on MLK memorial )\nMuch as Obama treads on new ground , the election and re-election of a black president have forced contemporary black civil rights leaders to confront a challenge that was hard to foresee half a century ago : Their activism is aimed at a fellow person of color .\nAt times over the past five years , the calculus for civil rights leaders who hope to prod the president to act on a range of issues has proven difficult . Obama has received overwhelming support from black voters in two elections , meaning the leaders of civil rights organizations are risking their own standing if they take him on . There \u2019 s also the danger that they could hurt the president politically by challenging him publicly . At the same time , Obama \u2019 s willingness to work around some of those leaders has caused consternation that is typically discussed only in private settings .\nObama has elevated Sharpton and his National Action Network by having one-on-sessions with the MSNBC television host and inviting him to group meetings with leaders of longer-standing civil rights organizations such as the NAACP .\n\u201c We found a respect for each other \u2019 s different roles , \u201d Sharpton said . \u201c He understands that I \u2019 m an activist and I understand that he \u2019 s the president [ while ] some of the guys \u2026 want him to be the civil rights leader that brings issues to himself . The president can \u2019 t lead a march on himself . \u201d\nThrough his years on the public stage , Obama has navigated the tightrope between embracing King \u2019 s legacy and appearing to co-opt it , but he has been criticized at times for missing on both sides of that mark .\nObama had spoken during his first campaign of being part of the \u201c Joshua generation , \u201d a Biblical reference that casts the vanguard of the civil rights movement as the \u201c Moses generation \u201d and Obama and others of his age as the successors obliged to carry on their work .\nFive years ago , as he accepted the Democratic Party \u2019 s presidential nomination in Denver on the 45th anniversary of King \u2019 s speech , Obama referred to King not by name but as \u201c the preacher , \u201d a rhetorical device that some took as an effort to avoid looking like he hoped to be compared to King .", "Soon after video recorded by Feidin Santana showing officer Michael Thomas Slager killing Walter Scott went public , Ed Driggers , the chief of the North Charleston , South Carolina , police force where Slager was once employed , spoke to the press . Like an increasing number of law enforcement officials as of late , Driggers found himself suddenly thrust into the media spotlight , tasked with explaining to an outraged nation why one of his officers used deadly force against an unarmed African-American , a 50-year-old father of four , who posed no threat .\nBut although Driggers \u2019 public appearance was , on a superficial level , all too reminiscent of what we recently saw in places as disparate as Ferguson , Missouri ; Cleveland , Ohio ; Staten Island , New York ; and Los Angeles , California , the substance was different . Because rather than mount a defense of officer Slager \u2014 who repeatedly claimed that he shot Scott only after a routine stop over a busted taillight led to physical altercation , one during which he feared for his life \u2014 Driggers buried him instead . \u201c I have watched the video and I was sickened by what I saw , \u201d he said . \u201c And I have not watched it since . \u201d\nWhat a difference a smartphone can make . As Judd Legum of Think Progress has noted , if not for the remarkably brave Santana , who used his smartphone to record the final moments of Scott \u2019 s life , the only version of the story the world would know is the version Slager told . Which , in plain language , was a monstrous lie . There 's no evidence that Scott tried to use Slager \u2019 s taser against him , as the officer claimed ; the only reason it was found near the dead man \u2019 s body , it appears , is because that \u2019 s where Slager put it . And contrary to what Slager said in the official incident report , he never feared for his personal safety ; as he pumps Scott \u2019 s back full of bullets he is calm , cool and collected .\nAccording to the work of one local reporter , Slager \u2019 s neighbors didn \u2019 t suspect him of being especially malevolent or inclined toward violence . To them , he seemed normal \u2014 even nice . Driggers responded with a similar mix of sadness and bewilderment . \u201c I want to believe in my heart of hearts that it was a tragic set of events after a traffic stop , \u201d Driggers said on CNN . \u201c I always look for the good in folks , \u201d he continued , \u201c and so I would hope that nobody would ever do something like that. \u201d Keith Summey , the town \u2019 s mayor , was also fatalistic : \u201c When you \u2019 re wrong , you \u2019 re wrong , \u201d he told the press . \u201c And if you make a bad decision \u2026 you have to live by that decision . \u201d\nNeither man was interested in damning Slager ; and considering he is now facing charges for murder , that \u2019 s probably for the best . But both men went further than simply biting their tongues ; they made a point of distancing Slager \u2019 s behavior from that of the overall North Charleston police force , too . \u201c The one does not totally throw a blanket across the many , \u201d Driggers said , according to the Los Angeles Times . The mayor and he noted that the NCPD is composed of more than 340 officers . The video traveling all over the world was hideous , no doubt . But it told us nothing of the overall law enforcement system ; it was merely a single man making a horrible , horrible mistake .\nUnfortunately , that wasn \u2019 t the case , because Slager is not the only officer seen in the video . After Scott had fallen to the ground , prostrate and bleeding , and after Slager had barked at him to put his hands behind his back ( so he could handcuff him before he lost the ability to move his arms ) , officer Clarence Habersham , who is African-American , arrives at the scene . His body language , like Scott \u2019 s , indicates this was not the first time he \u2019 d come upon such a scene . He seems unperturbed as he kneels down to check Scott \u2019 s pulse . He makes no real attempt to save the back-shot man \u2019 s life . And that \u2019 s understandable , really ; Scott was likely already dead .\nWe don \u2019 t know yet what exactly transpired between Slager , Habersham , or the third , Caucasian one who joins them later . We don \u2019 t know how much they knew , and we don \u2019 t know when they knew it . What we do know , though , is plenty . We know that the police department of North Charleston was content to treat Slager \u2019 s story as fact ; and we know that this was not the first time a member of the force had engaged in acts that we \u2019 d otherwise describe as thuggery . We know that in the past five years , police officers in South Carolina have used their guns against 209 human beings ; and we know that they were exonerated of wrongdoing every single time .\nLastly , we know that Walter Scott \u2014 a father , brother , cousin and veteran ; a man who loved to joke and loved to dance , and who was known as the extrovert of his family \u2014 died after being shot multiple times when his back was turned . And we know that if he lived long enough to be conscious as Slager tightened the cuffs around each of his wrists , his spent his final moments on this Earth alone , and enchained .", "James Earl Ray grips the steering wheel and turns his plans over in his head . A year ago , he was an inmate doing 20 years for armed robbery in Missouri . He made a daring escape , hiding in a corrections truck and bolting out the back door after it left the prison . He 's been on the run ever since . Montreal . Los Angeles . Mexico . A couple weeks ago he moved to Atlanta , renting a room in a cheap boarding house .\n\u201c I 'm going to hunt deer in Wisconsin , \u201d he told the clerk at the Aeromarine Supply Co. in Birmingham , Ala. , giving his name as Harvey Lowmeyer .

King and Abernathy check into Room 306 along the second-floor balcony . Cotton is next door in Room 307 . Young and Lee are downstairs .\n12:05 p.m. \u2014 Leaves for a meeting at Rev . James Lawson 's Centenary United Methodist Church in South Memphis . There , a large gathering of pastors and supporters discuss the anticipated march next week as word trickles in that the city has convinced a judge to issue an injunction .\n2:15 p.m. \u2014 The meeting breaks up and Mathews drives King back to the Lorraine .\nThe police have a duty to be watching , to keep law and order , but their mission is murky . Some officers were assigned for security , to protect King . But Redditt and his partner , Willie Richmond , have more specific orders \u2014 to keep an eye on King 's movements .\n\u201c The reason for the surveillance being ordered was because Dr. King was a controversial figure \u201d and because he 'd \u201c been meeting with local black militants , \u201d a police report said .\nThough few know it , Redditt and Richmond are only the tip of a much larger operation .\nWith assistance from the local FBI office the previous fall , the Memphis Police Department set up an intelligence unit , sometimes called a Red Squad , whose job is to monitor \u201c Reds , \u201d or Communists , radicals , militants and others deemed dangerous by the government . Working closely with the FBI 's William H. Lawrence , the agent in charge of domestic security in Memphis , MPD is assembling files on hundreds of people , some street thugs and criminals but many others law-abiding citizens whose political views simply veer left of mainstream Memphis .\nIt 's a great injustice to Mathews , an attractive woman who favors glittery earrings , permed hair and stylish coats , and could be mistaken for a pastor 's wife or a tea club socialite , yet at heart is a fiery activist .\nIn a way , she is the Rosa Parks of Memphis .\nBack in 1958 , when she was 25 , Mathews dared to venture onto the grounds of the Memphis Zoo on a Sunday , a day reserved for white residents . Like Parks , who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in that seminal confrontation in Montgomery , Ala. , which helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955 , Mathews stood her ground . When police escorted her out , she followed up with a federal lawsuit that led to the city taking down the infamous \u201c Thursday Only \u201d signs that allowed black residents to visit one day a week at the zoo and nearby Brooks Art Gallery . City parks , golf courses and swimming pools were integrated , too .\nSince the sanitation strike broke , her activism is taking an increasingly militant tone .\nMuch of it is traditional movement fare \u2014 she gives free haircuts to garbage men at her Orange Mound shop and , as a singer , leads rallies in rousing versions of \u201c I Shall Not Be Moved , \u201d \u201c We Shall Overcome \u201d and \u201c Ai n't Gon na Let Nobody Turn Me Around \u201d \u2014 but police are alarmed by her conduct . She forges a public bond with her pastor , Ezekiel Bell , who is making volatile statements that include a reference to burning down the city , and confides she is a fan of Malcolm X , the assassinated black nationalist . And what she sees in King today she likes . 2\n\u201c We are going to march even if we ca n't get the injunction overturned , \u201d King told Lawson and the others that afternoon back at the church .\nAs she drops King and his entourage off at the Lorraine , a detective watches from the curb and another eyes them from a peephole in a firehouse across the street .", "Bias Is n't Just A Police Problem , It 's A Preschool Problem\nLate one night , a man searches for something in a parking lot . On his hands and knees , he crawls around a bright circle of light created by a streetlamp overhead .\n`` Oh , no . I dropped them way over there , '' he says , gesturing vaguely to some faraway spot on the other side of the lot .\nNew research from the Yale Child Study Center suggests that many preschool teachers look for disruptive behavior in much the same way : in just one place , waiting for it to appear .\nThe problem with this strategy ( besides it being inefficient ) , is that , because of implicit bias , teachers are spending too much time watching black boys and expecting the worst .\nLead researcher Walter Gilliam knew that to get an accurate measure of implicit bias among preschool teachers , he could n't be fully transparent with his subjects about what , exactly , he was trying to study .\nImplicit biases are just that \u2014 subtle , often subconscious stereotypes that guide our expectations and interactions with people .\n`` We all have them , '' Gilliam says . `` Implicit biases are a natural process by which we take information , and we judge people on the basis of generalizations regarding that information . We all do it . ''\nEven the most well-meaning teacher can harbor deep-seated biases , whether she knows it or not . So Gilliam and his team devised a remarkable \u2014 and remarkably deceptive \u2014 experiment .\nAt a big , annual conference for pre-K teachers , Gilliam and his team recruited 135 educators to watch a few short videos . Here 's what they told them :\nWe are interested in learning about how teachers detect challenging\nbehavior in the classroom . Sometimes this involves seeing behavior before it becomes problematic . The video segments you are about to view are of preschoolers engaging in various activities . Some clips may or may not contain challenging behaviors . Your job is to press the enter key on the external keypad every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge .\nEach video included four children : a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl .\nWhile the teachers watched , eye-scan technology measured the trajectory of their gaze . Gilliam wanted to know : When teachers expected bad behavior , who did they watch ?\n`` What we found was exactly what we expected based on the rates at which children are expelled from preschool programs , '' Gilliam says . `` Teachers looked more at the black children than the white children , and they looked specifically more at the African-American boy . ''\nIndeed , according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education , black children are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended from preschool than white children . Put another way , black children account for roughly 19 percent of all preschoolers , but nearly half of preschoolers who get suspended .\nOne reason that number is so high , Gilliam suggests , is that teachers spend more time focused on their black students , expecting bad behavior . `` If you look for something in one place , that 's the only place you can typically find it . ''\nThe Yale team also asked subjects to identify the child they felt required the most attention . Forty-two percent identified the black boy , 34 percent identified the white boy , while 13 percent and 10 percent identified the white and black girls respectively .\nThe Yale study had two parts . And , as compelling as the eye-scan results were , Gilliam 's most surprising takeaway came later .\nHe gave teachers a one-paragraph vignette to read , describing a child disrupting a class ; there 's hitting , scratching , even toy-throwing . The child in the vignette was randomly assigned what researchers considered a stereotypical name ( DeShawn , Latoya , Jake , Emily ) , and subjects were asked to rate the severity of the behavior on a scale of one to five .\nWhite teachers consistently held black students to a lower standard , rating their behavior as less severe than the same behavior of white students .\nGilliam says this tracks with previous research around how people may shift standards and expectations of others based on stereotypes and implicit bias . In other words , if white teachers believe that black boys are more likely to behave badly , they may be less surprised by that behavior and rate it less severely .\nBlack teachers , on the other hand , did the opposite , holding black students to a higher standard and rating their behavior as consistently more severe than that of white students .\nHere 's another key finding : Some teachers were also given information about the disruptive child 's home life , to see if it made them more empathetic :\n[ CHILD ] lives with his/her mother , his/her 8- and 6-year-old sisters ,\nand his/her 10-month-old baby brother . His/her home life is turbulent , between having a father who has never been a constant figure in his/her life , and a mother who struggles with depression but does n't have the resources available to seek help . During the rare times when his/her parents are together , loud and sometimes violent disputes occur between them . In order to make ends meet , [ CHILD 's ] mother has taken on three different jobs , and is in a constant state of exhaustion . [ CHILD ] and his/her siblings are left in the care of available relatives and neighbors while their mother is at work .\nTeachers who received this background did react more empathetically , lowering their rating of a behavior 's severity \u2014 but only if the teacher and student were of the same race .\nAs for white teachers rating black students or black teachers rating white students ?\n`` If the race of the teacher and the child were different and [ the teacher ] received this background information , severity rates skyrocketed , '' Gilliam says . `` And the teachers ended up feeling that the behavioral problems were hopeless and that very little could be done to actually improve the situation . ''\nThis result is consistent with previous research on empathy , Gilliam says . `` When people feel some kind of shared connection to folks , when they hear more about their misfortunes , they feel more empathic to them .

For the family to suffer as this family has only compounds that loss , \u201d Donoghue said at a press conference . \u201c But these unassailable facts are separate and distinct from whether a federal crime has been committed . And the evidence here does not support charging Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo or any other officer with a federal criminal civil rights violation . \u201d\nHe later said , \u201c Significantly , Officer Pantaleo was not engaged in a chokehold on Mr. Garner when he said he could not breathe , and neither Officer Pantaleo nor any other officer applied a chokehold to Mr. Garner after he first said he could not breathe . \u201d\nThe decision to not bring civil rights charges against Pantaleo comes the day before the statute of limitations in the case was to set to expire \u2014 and the fifth anniversary of Garner \u2019 s death on July 17 , 2014 .\nProsecutors met with Garner \u2019 s family and their advisers Tuesday morning ahead of announcing the decision , which leaked about 90 minutes beforehand .\nDonoghue said the government was tasked with the uphill battle of proving beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c that an officer willfully used more force than he reasonably could have believed was necessary under the circumstances . \u201d\nHe also pointed to a disagreement among medical experts as to the cause of Garner \u2019 s death . One medical examiner ruled his death a homicide , while another couldn \u2019 t conclusively say whether the chokehold was the cause .\nTwo other medical experts said the heart attack Garner suffered could \u2019 ve stemmed from a number of causes .\n\u201c This is significant because it casts doubt upon whether the chokehold itself caused Mr. Garner \u2019 s death , \u201d Donoghue said .\nDonoghue said the investigation relied heavily on video of the encounter between Garner and the officers \u2014 who were attempting to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes .\n\u201c The video shows that the officers \u2019 initial actions were in accordance with established police tactics and procedures , but that the situation deteriorated as it progressed , \u201d he said .\nPantaleo used \u201c two approved NYPD tactics \u201d involving force to subdue Garner , who was resisting arrest \u2014 an \u201c arm bar \u201d and a \u201c rear takedown \u201d or \u201c seat belt . \u201d\nIt was the latter maneuver that caused Garner to lose balance and fall backward with Pantaleo , whose body slammed against a store window .\n\u201c It appears that , in response to that collision , and to maintain a hold on Mr. Garner , Officer Pantaleo wrapped his left arm around Mr. Garner \u2019 s neck , resulting in what was , in effect , a chokehold , \u201d Donoghue said .\nDonoghue said the \u201c significant difference in size and weight \u201d between the two men contributed to the difficulty in placing Garner under arrest . Garner was 6 feet 2 and weighed close to 400 pounds , while Pantaleo is \u201c considerably smaller , \u201d according to Donoghue .\nPantaleo \u2019 s lawyer Stu London said \u201c it is always a tragedy when there is a loss of life \u201d \u2014 but defended his client \u2019 s actions that day .\n\u201c Officer Pantaleo utilized NYPD approved techniques to make the arrest in this case , \u201d London said . \u201c Officer Pantaleo is gratified that the Justice Department took the time to carefully review the actual evidence in this case rather than the lies and inaccuracies which have followed this case since its inception . \u201d\nA Staten Island grand jury declined to prosecute Pantaleo in 2014 .\nThe cop underwent an NYPD disciplinary trial recently , though a ruling has not yet been issued .\nIn a statement , NYPD spokesman Phil Walzak said the DOJ \u2019 s decision doesn \u2019 t affect the departmental proceeding .\n\u201c Commissioner [ James ] O \u2019 Neill is now awaiting the report and recommendation from the Deputy Commissioner of Trials , after which he will make the final determination on the matter , \u201d Walzak said . \u201c In order to ensure the integrity of the process , the NYPD will not comment further at this time . \u201d\nPantaleo , who was stripped of his badge and gun , has been on desk duty since Garner \u2019 s death .\nIn a statement , Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch said the feds \u2019 decision to not prosecute Pantaleo clears his name .\n\u201c Scapegoating a good and honorable officer , who was doing his job in the manner he was taught , will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city , \u201d Lynch said . \u201c We firmly believe that if the NYPD decides the disciplinary case on the facts , free of improper political influence , that Police Officer Pantaleo , will be fully exonerated of any wrongdoing . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Fred Davie , the chair of the city Civilian Complaint Review Board , which brought the case against Pantaleo in his departmental trial , called on O \u2019 Neill to fire the cop .\n\u201c Our last hope for justice in this case lies with the police commissioner , \u201d Davie said . \u201c CCRB prosecutors presented evidence at trial that showed \u2014 unequivocally \u2014 that Officer Pantaleo engaged in misconduct worthy of termination .

CPJ could not determine on what grounds police were holding Khatun .\nThe journalists \u2019 arrests were prompted by a complaint filed just after midnight on June 29 by a local resident , whose name was not disclosed , who alleged that Islam and Khan had photographed him cutting down a tree on government land , a criminal offense , on March 16 , and then extorted money from him in exchange for not publishing the image , Ahammed said .\nThe journalists \u2019 lawyers told CPJ that they believe the arrests were actually retaliation for Islam and Khan \u2019 s reporting on alleged corruption in government funds distributed to private clubs amid the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\u201c The arrests of Arambagh TV editor Safikul Islam and reporter Suraj Ali Khan , as well as of Islam \u2019 s wife , are clear attempts to intimidate the journalists and force them to stop their critical reporting , \u201d said Aliya Iftikhar , CPJ \u2019 s senior Asia researcher , in New York . \u201c The three should be released immediately and all investigations into them dropped .

In two cases opened on April 28 and others opened on May 6 , 13 , and 14 , police have investigated the journalists for alleged cheating , forgery , defamation , public mischief , criminal conspiracy , wrongful restraint , provocation that will break public peace , criminal intimidation , disobeying a public servant , obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions , causing grievous harm to a deter public servant from his duty , and assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty , according to those documents .\nPolice are also investigating Khan and Islam for allegedly violating sections of the Disaster Management Law , which was invoked in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic , and for making false statements and printing or publishing news without conforming to rules under the Press and Registration of Books Law , according to those documents .\nOn June 2 , the Calcutta High Court instructed the police not to take any coercive action against Islam or Khan in relation to the investigations , as the journalists assured the court that they would cooperate with authorities and would be physically present at the police station whenever summoned for questioning , according to Karar .\nIslam and Khan followed the court \u2019 s instructions and appeared before the Arambagh police for questioning on June 10 , Karar said .\nCPJ emailed Hooghly Rural Superintendent of Police Tathagata Basu , who oversees the police responsible for the journalists \u2019 arrests , for comment , but did not receive any reply . In a press conference held on July 4 , Basu denied wrongdoing on the part of police and claimed that Islam was being investigated for fraud and that Arambagh TV was run illegally , without government permission .\nAhammed told CPJ that no regulatory permission is required under Indian law to run an internet-based news outlet .\nPreviously , in early May , Arambagh TV posted two videos in which Islam and Khatun separately claimed that mobs of 30 to 40 people had surrounded their homes and threatened them over their coverage .\nIn June , the West Bengal police opened an investigation into the editor of Bengali-daily Anandabazaar Patrika following a complaint from a senior bureaucrat over the newspaper \u2019 s coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic , as CPJ documented at the time .", "According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the administration is \u201c looking at \u201d the possibility of banning a range of Chinese apps , including the hugely popular video-sharing app .\nTikTok , which was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of the year , has long been a source of national security concern for U.S. politicians , and now the Trump administration says it \u2019 s seriously considering banning the app .\n\u201c We are taking this very seriously and we are certainly looking at it .

If you tried to parody the sad decline of prestige awards in those fields into an ideologically blinkered self-congratulatory echo chamber for progressive agitprop , it would be difficult to find a more on-the-nose example than the Pulitzer Prize awarded to Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times for commentary . Hannah-Jones was , according to the Pulitzer committee , honored for \u201c a sweeping , deeply reported and personal essay for the ground-breaking 1619 Project , which seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America \u2019 s story , prompting public conversation about the nation \u2019 s founding and evolution . \u201d\n\u201c Deeply reported \u201d is one way to describe an essay that required the Times to append a correction and a separate \u201c Editor \u2019 s Note \u201d regarding an incendiary assertion that was presented without factual support , and that resulted in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s eventually admitting , after seven months of defending the claim , scrambling to find scholarly support for it , and bitterly denouncing her critics in racial terms , that \u201c in attempting to summarize and streamline , journalists can sometimes lose important context and nuance . I did that here. \u201d One hesitates to think what the runners-up for the award looked like .\nTechnically , the Pulitzer is for Hannah-Jones \u2019 s lead essay in the 1619 Project , and not for her role as the self-described architect of the rest of the essay collection . So , we can set aside the errors ranging from American political history to basic economics that plagued other submissions and focus on the lead essay .\nThe most dramatic and controversial assertion in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s essay was that , in 1776 , \u201c one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery. \u201d Her essay cited nothing to support this , nor did it show even the slightest awareness of how radical a claim this is . She continued :\nBy 1776 , Britain had grown deeply conflicted over its role in the barbaric institution that had reshaped the Western Hemisphere . In London , there were growing calls to abolish the slave trade . This would have upended the economy of the colonies , in both the North and the South . . . we may never have revolted against Britain if some of the founders had not . . . believed that independence was required in order to ensure that slavery would continue .\nThis is ahistorical nonsense , which is why it was met almost instantly by a chorus of derision from the leading lights of the historical profession . It gets the chronology on both sides of the Atlantic wrong . While Hannah-Jones openly scoffs that there is \u201c no such thing \u201d as objective history , there are absolutely such things as objective facts . Dates are one of those .\nThe first real strike against slavery was the 1772 Somerset judicial decision in Britain , which declared that slavery was alien to the English common law and thus could not exist within Britain without a positive act of Parliament . As Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz has noted , however , the reaction to the Somerset case , which did not apply to British colonies , was relatively muted even in the southern colonies ; it provoked nothing even vaguely resembling the furious responses to the Tea Act the following year . Most of the southern colonies had positive laws about slavery anyway ; Virginia \u2019 s , for example , was enacted by the House of Burgesses in 1705 .\nOrganized , popular movements against slavery , and laws restricting or abolishing slavery and the slave trade , were considerably more advanced in the American colonies in the 1770s than in Britain , where Parliament would not ban slavery in Jamaica and other British colonies until 1833 , after many years of failures by William Wilberforce and other anti-slavery leaders . The world \u2019 s first organized anti-slavery society was formed in Pennsylvania in 1774 , and the first legal ban on slavery anywhere in the world was in Vermont in 1777 . Five of the original 13 states followed suit either during or immediately after the Revolution , passing bans on slavery between 1780 and 1784 . The first federal ban on slavery , in the Northwest Territory , was drafted in 1784 by Thomas Jefferson and passed by the Confederation Congress in 1787 . Its language would later be adopted directly into the 13th Amendment .\nSlavery as such had died a natural death in Britain and most of Western and Central Europe over the ten centuries between the fall of Rome and the age of exploration , but Americans of the Founding generation were the first people in world history to set seriously about the business of killing it on principle . This in an age when , in the words of Seymour Drescher ( one of the leading historians of global slavery and abolition ) , \u201c personal bondage was the prevailing form of labor in most of the world . . . Freedom , not slavery , was the peculiar institution . \u201d\nBy contrast , anti-slavery agitation was still getting off the ground in Britain in 1775 and remained a long way from becoming a potent political force . Wilberforce himself would not even enter Parliament until 1780 and became a publicly committed anti-slavery advocate only in 1787 , the year Britain \u2019 s Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed . Hannah-Jones cites the Constitution \u2019 s 20-year ban on Congress prohibiting the slave trade , but she leaves out three rather important facts : that multiple colonies and states legislated against the trade before and during the Revolution ; that Congress banned the trade at the first possible moment , in 1807 , at the insistence of President Jefferson ; and that Britain , with no such constitutional restriction , only got around to banning the slave trade the same year .\nThis is the tip of the iceberg ; the reality , known to anyone who has studied the period with any degree of intellectual honesty and curiosity , is that the rhetoric and ideals of revolutionary America were a major driving force in compelling people on both sides of the Atlantic to think about human liberty and how it could be reconciled with slavery and other forms of forced labor . The same dynamic happened in France , where anti-slavery went from the talk of a small intellectual elite to a matter of serious legislative debate only with the French Revolution . This is human nature : People want rights and liberties for themselves and their own , and only in the fighting for those things are they brought to face the question of why those same principles should not apply to everyone .\nIn order to paint the American Revolution as a fight to protect slavery from an anti-slavery Britain , you not only need to ignore the whole history of anti-slavery , you also must invert the chronology and geography of the Revolution . In reality , the Revolution began in Massachusetts , and the colonies with few slaves and early slavery bans were its most enthusiastic backers , while those with the most slaves tended to have the highest concentrations of Loyalists . Banastre Tarleton , the notorious leader of the Loyalist militia in North Carolina , was heir to a Liverpool slave-trading fortune and went on to a long career after the war as a vocal defender of the slave trade in Britain . Hannah-Jones \u2019 s alternative history also requires discarding the whole historical literature of the public and private arguments of the men who made the Revolution . Virtually none of them ever attempted \u2014 in speeches , in pamphlets , even in private letters \u2014 to convince anyone else to rebel to protect slavery .\nIt is telling in this regard that one of Hannah-Jones \u2019 s defenders , Adam Serwer of The Atlantic , entitled his essay on the controversy \u201c The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts , \u201d and that Hannah-Jones cited as a \u201c brilliant analysis \u201d an essay from left-wing historian David Waldstreicher ( the only historian she named in her own essay ) saying that those taking Hannah-Jones \u2019 s view of the question of what motivated the American revolutionaries \u201c do not take for granted that the story is primarily one of uncovering the motives and beliefs of the founders. \u201d This is quite an admission , given that the entire debate is about Hannah-Jones \u2019 s claim about the \u201c primary \u201d motives and beliefs of the Founders .\nWaldstreicher takes the position of every conspiracy theorist : that the men who led the public debates over the momentous decision to separate from Britain were too embarrassed to mention in public or in private their real reasons , so that the absence of evidence is proof against them . But if you have read anything of the debates at the Constitutional Convention , or the 18th-century arguments over abolition in the northern states , or the rest of American politics between 1775 and 1861 , you know that American slaveowners were not shy about asserting their interests . We know that the states that seceded in 1860-61 did so over slavery because they said so . Slaveowners were horrified by the 1775 effort by Lord Dunsmore to raise a slave rebellion in Virginia , after the war had started , and said so . But virtually nobody argued that this had been the casus belli in the first place ; at most , it aggravated an existing breach that had already come to war . The chief self-interested cause of Virginia slaveowners such as George Washington was the opening of the Ohio Valley to settlement \u2014 and when they had secured that territory , they banned slavery from it .\nHannah-Jones \u2019 s invented history of the American Revolution attracted the most scholarly denunciation , but other parts of her Pulitzer-winning essay were misleading , at best , in their retelling of American history . She described slavery in the 13 colonies as \u201c unlike anything that had existed in the world before , \u201d but racial chattel plantation slavery existed in Haiti and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies before 1619 . In fact , she noted that the first slaves in 1619 were stolen from a Portuguese slave ship , but never asked where it was headed . She wrote of the Declaration of Independence , \u201c the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of black people in their midst , \u201d ignoring the fact that two of the three men on the drafting committee ( John Adams and Benjamin Franklin ) were opposed to slavery . On the Constitution , relying on Waldstreicher , she offered half-truths :\nThat the Constitution \u201c protected the \u2018 property \u2019 of those who enslaved black people ; \u201d in fact , it protects property rights in general , but was specifically written to avoid giving explicit federal recognition to \u201c property in man , \u201d as detailed in Wilentz \u2019 s book No Property in Man . Instead , it pointedly refers to slaves as \u201c persons. \u201d Its only specific protection for ownership of slaves is the fugitive slave clause , with which Hannah-Jones takes separate issue .\nThat it \u201c allowed Congress to mobilize the militia to put down insurrections by the enslaved ; \u201d in fact , this power refers generally to any insurrection . It was invoked against the Whiskey Rebellion and against the Confederacy , and was cited by Congress as authority for the Militia Act of 1862 , which authorized the enlistment of \u201c persons of African descent . \u201d\nSpeaking of the civil-rights movement , she wrote : \u201c For the most part , black Americans fought back alone. \u201d Unlike the movements against slavery and the slave trade , in which free black Americans \u2014 while important voices \u2014 were too few and too powerless to be a driving force , African Americans took the starring role in the civil-rights movement in its crucial period between the mid 1940s and late 1960s . But never alone . Other Americans marched and , in some cases , died for civil rights . Branch Rickey hired Jackie Robinson . Harry Truman desegregated the Army . An all-white Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education . Dwight Eisenhower sent federal troops to Little Rock . Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act , with bipartisan support from an almost entirely white House and an all-white Senate .\nHannah-Jones spent five paragraphs on Abraham Lincoln , dwelling entirely on an out-of-context quote from the 1858 Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates and a meeting in August 1862 when he proposed to black abolitionist leaders \u201c to ship black people , once freed , to another country. \u201d Contrary to the implication in that phrasing , Lincoln was proposing voluntary emigration , but more importantly , both his disclaimer of black equality in 1858 and his push for colonization in the summer of 1862 ( while a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation sat in his drawer ) were part of Lincoln \u2019 s political strategy to bring wavering whites over to the anti-slavery cause . It is fair enough to criticize Lincoln for a certain political cynicism , or for sharing some of the endemic prejudices of his age , but to paint the Great Emancipator \u2014 who was gunned down for supporting the vote for freed slaves \u2014 solely as an enemy of black liberty is not honest history at all . Worse , Hannah-Jones claimed that \u201c Lincoln was blaming [ black people ] for the war , \u201d which no fair-minded reader of the 16th president \u2019 s public statements from 1861 to 1865 could believe with a straight face .\nHannah-Jones \u2019 s essay , and the 1619 Project as a whole , were sharply criticized by a who \u2019 s who of America \u2019 s leading historians of the Revolution , the Founding era , and the Civil War , most of them political liberals . The World Socialist Web Site , a Trotskyist publication , did surprisingly good yeoman work in interviewing many of these scholars , among them :\nGordon Wood , professor emeritus at Brown University and perhaps the leading living scholar on the revolutionary era ;\nJames McPherson , professor emeritus of history at Princeton University and author of the preeminent single-volume history of the Civil War era ;\nJames Oakes , Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York , and a leading writer on abolitionism , Lincoln , and Frederick Douglass ;\nVictoria Bynum , distinguished emerita professor of history at Texas State University and a writer on the social history of the Civil War era ; and\nClayborne Carson , professor of history at Stanford University and director of its Martin Luther King , Jr. , Research and Education Institute , a job for which he was hand-picked by Coretta Scott King .\nThe interviews make brutal reading . Wood , McPherson , Wilentz , Oakes , and Bynum wrote an open letter to the Times \u201c as historians to express our strong reservations about important aspects of The 1619 Project. \u201d None of the scholarly critics argued against the idea of publishing a project on this topic , or disputed that some of its content was valuable . They took issue , instead , with its sloppy treatment of the facts : \u201c These errors , which concern major events , can not be described as interpretation or \u2018 framing. \u2019 They are matters of verifiable fact , which are the foundation of both honest scholarship and honest journalism . They suggest a displacement of historical understanding by ideology. \u201d They also noted how very few of the leading experts had been consulted by the Times . Noticeably , Princeton \u2019 s Kevin Kruse ( who contributed a piece to the 1619 Project on traffic in Atlanta and styles himself as the leader of \u201c Twitterstorians \u201d ) went rather silent on the controversy once the gray eminences of his own department weighed in .\nThe knee-jerk reaction by Hannah-Jones to historical criticism was to tweet , \u201c LOL . Right , because white historians have produced truly objective history. \u201d This was part of a general pattern of unserious and dismissive antics by Hannah-Jones , who calls herself the \u201c Beyonc\u00e9 of journalism. \u201d At some point , this should probably have given the Times pause in entrusting her with the paper \u2019 s good name . It is also a symptom of the toxic Twitter environment ; in a talk with Henry Louis Gates in December , she was less confrontational , admitting that Newt Gingrich and others had a valid point in asking why her history ignored white Northerners who fought against slavery in the Civil War .\nNew York Times Magazine editor in chief Jake Silverstein responded to the historians \u2019 letter with a long , mealy-mouthed response : \u201c Historical understanding is not fixed ; it is constantly being adjusted by new scholarship and new voices . Within the world of academic history , differing views exist , if not over what precisely happened , then about why it happened , who made it happen , how to interpret the motivations of historical actors and what it all means. \u201d Silverstein took the scholarly vivisection of Hannah-Jones \u2019 s work as proof of \u201c what we hoped our project would do : expand the reader \u2019 s sense of the American past . \u201d\nFinally , in March \u2014 seven months after publication \u2014 Politico published a whistleblowing essay by one of the 1619 Project \u2019 s fact-checkers , Northwestern professor Leslie Harris , taking issue with a number of things said in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s essay , and specifically observing that she had been asked to fact-check the most controversial passage and had her objections ignored :\nI vigorously disputed the claim . Although slavery was certainly an issue in the American Revolution , the protection of slavery was not one of the main reasons the 13 Colonies went to war . . . Far from being fought to preserve slavery , the Revolutionary War became a primary disrupter of slavery in the North American Colonies . . .\nThis , at last , compelled Hannah-Jones and the Times to make one correction to the essay , changing \u201c one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence \u201d to \u201c one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence. \u201d Hannah-Jones conceded , at last , that her original sentence had been devoid of context and nuance . Silverstein appended an \u201c Editor \u2019 s Note \u201d conceding that \u201c we recognize that our original language could be read to suggest that protecting slavery was a primary motivation for all of the colonists . The passage has been changed to make clear that this was a primary motivation for some of the colonists. \u201d Of course , in any popular movement , you can find somebody who believes a thing ; ascribing historical causation is supposed to aim rather higher than the search for a fig leaf .\nThe facts are , of course , the central thing \u2014 both the hard , provable facts and the broader narratives of causation , motivation , and effect that historians draw from them . It is apparent enough that Hannah-Jones dug in so hard on her particular claim about the American Revolution because she was wedded so deeply to the narrative that the 1776 founding of the nation could not be allowed to be regarded as a milestone in the idea of human liberty . That is why her essay gave her attack on the founding such prominent placement .\nIn public statements , Hannah-Jones has been open that her objective was agitprop : \u201c When my editor asks me , like , what \u2019 s your ultimate goal for the project , my ultimate goal is that there \u2019 ll be a reparations bill passed. \u201d \u201c I write to try to get liberal white people to do what they say they believe in . I \u2019 m making a moral argument . My method is guilt . \u201d\nAs for her employer , Slate published a transcript of a town-hall meeting held by Times executive editor Dean Baquet in August 2019 , in which he responded to a staffer asking\nto what extent you think that the fact of racism and white supremacy being sort of the foundation of this country should play into our reporting . Just because it feels to me like it should be a starting point , you know ? . . . I just feel like racism is in everything . It should be considered in our science reporting , in our culture reporting , in our national reporting .\nBaquet pointed , in his response , to the 1619 Project : \u201c I do think that race and understanding of race should be a part of how we cover the American story . . . one reason we all signed off on the 1619 Project and made it so ambitious and expansive was to teach our readers to think a little bit more like that . \u201d\nAs for the Pulitzer committee , which is run through Columbia University and ( predictably ) includes Gail Collins of the Times , one way to pitch a piece of journalism as Pulitzer-worthy is to have it embraced by the ( unaffiliated ) Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting . At the time of the 1619 Project \u2019 s publication in August 2019 , the Pulitzer Center issued a press release touting its pride in its educational arm being \u201c selected as the education partner \u201d by the Times to create a school curriculum out of the 1619 Project , complete with a glowing quote from the head of the Pulitzer Center :\n\u201c We are honored to have the opportunity to work with The New York Times on this landmark initiative , \u201d said Jon Sawyer , executive director of the Pulitzer Center . \u201c The education network we have built over the past 13 years is premised on the belief that journalism can be the engine for public education and civil discourse . It is hard to imagine a topic more resonant , or more important , than \u2018 The 1619 Project. \u2019 \u201d . . . Hannah-Jones and other contributors to the \u2018 1619 \u2019 issue will visit Pulitzer Center partner schools in the coming months . A schedule of public speaking appearances by Hannah-Jones and other \u2018 1619 \u2019 contributors will appear on the Center \u2019 s events page when available .\nOn August 13 \u2014 the day before publication \u2014 the Times held a live rollout event , at which Silverstein \u201c thanked the Pulitzer Center and . . . mentioned the sheet in the [ Times ] magazine highlighting the Pulitzer Center \u2019 s education materials. \u201d In September , the Chicago Public Schools announced : \u201c Thanks to our partners at the Pulitzer Center , every CPS high school will receive 200\u2013400 copies of the New York Times \u2019 The 1619 Project this week as a resource to help reframe the institution of slavery , and how we \u2019 re still influenced by it today. \u201d In October , \u201c Pulitzer Center staff ventured to high schools and colleges in Illinois and North Carolina \u201d to promote this initiative .\nYou know , and I know , and everybody else on this planet knows , that nothing full of as many shoddy errors and untruths , and subject to such withering scholarly rebuttal , as the 1619 Project would be awarded an accolade such as a Pulitzer if its politics were of the right rather than of the left . Nor , for that matter , would the Times devote such effort to defending an assertion as outlandish as Hannah-Jones \u2019 s view of the American Revolution unless it had strong ideological and institutional reasons to be wedded to the argument . Maybe this deserves a prize , but not one for honest history .", "If someone had simply stopped and double-checked some math , they might have saved MSNBC \u2019 s Brian Williams and New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay some embarrassment and an apology Thursday night .\nInstead , both Williams and Gay marveled on air in reaction to a Twitter user \u2019 s post about Mike Bloomberg \u2019 s campaign spending .\nTrouble is , the post had gotten the math all wrong \u2013 yet neither Williams nor Gay seemed to notice .\nMSNBC 'S RACHEL MADDOW TELLS WARREN HER 2020 EXIT IS 'CRUSHING , ' A 'DEATH KNELL ' FOR A FUTURE FEMALE POTUS\nThe Super Tuesday evening post , now deleted , said : \u201c Bloomberg spent $ 500 million on ads .

Bernie Sanders at a Capitol Hill press conference introducing Sanders \u2019 s \u201c Medicare for All \u201d plan , September 13 , 2017 . ( Yuri Gripas/Reuters )\nWholesale seizure and control of private property ? With 2020 in her sights , Warren woos the hard Left .\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has one-upped socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez : She proposes to nationalize every major business in the United States of America . If successful , it would constitute the largest seizure of private property in human history .\nWarren \u2019 s proposal is dishonestly called the \u201c Accountable Capitalism Act. \u201d Accountable to whom ? you might ask . That \u2019 s a reasonable question . The answer is \u2014 as it always is \u2014 accountable to politicians , who desire to put the assets and productivity of private businesses under political discipline for their own selfish ends . It is remarkable that people who are most keenly attuned to the self-interest of CEOs and shareholders and the ways in which that self-interest influences their decisions apparently believe that members of the House , senators , presidents , regulators , Cabinet secretaries , and agency chiefs somehow are liberated from self-interest when they take office through some kind of miracle of transcendence .\nUnder Senator Warren \u2019 s proposal , no business with more than $ 1 billion in revenue would be permitted to legally operate without permission from the federal government . The federal government would then dictate to these businesses the composition of their boards , the details of internal corporate governance , compensation practices , personnel policies , and much more . Naturally , their political activities would be restricted , too . Senator Warren \u2019 s proposal entails the wholesale expropriation of private enterprise in the United States , and nothing less . It is unconstitutional , unethical , immoral , irresponsible , and \u2014 not to put too fine a point on it \u2014 utterly bonkers .\nIt is also cynical . Senator Warren is many things : a crass opportunist , intellectually bankrupt , personally vapid , a peddler of witless self-help books , etc . But she is not stupid . She knows that this is a go-nowhere proposition , that she will be spared by the Republican legislative majority from the ignominy that would ensue from the wholehearted pursuit of this daft program . It is in reality only a means of staking out for purely strategic reasons the most radical corner for her 2020 run at the Democratic presidential nomination . The Democratic party in 2018 , like the Republican primary electorate in 2016 , is out for blood and desirous of confrontation . So Senator Warren is running this red flag up the flagpole to see who salutes .\nTo propose such a thing for sincere reasons would be ghastly stupidity . To propose this program for narrowly self-serving political reasons is the sort of thing that would end a political career in a sane and self-respecting state , which Massachusetts plainly is not and has not been for some time .\nWhen the owners of Apple wish to hold on to their own after-tax earnings , they are denounced as greedy . When Elizabeth Warren wants to seize those earnings for her own use , what is that ? It is covetousness , which is what you get when you have greed compounded with envy .\nTo those on the left who look at Senator Warren \u2019 s proposal and think that giving the government a stronger whip hand over American businesses is just the ticket , I would like to present four questions : Who is the president of these United States ? Who is the majority leader in the Senate ? Who is the speaker of the House ? How would you evaluate the composition of the Supreme Court , either as it stands or after President Donald Trump has the opportunity to nominate another justice or two ? The power you give the federal government will be there during Republican administrations , too . Any future populist demagogue who finds his way into the White House will have access to the same power . No one should be trusted with that kind of power .\nAnd nobody who seeks that kind of power should be trusted with any power at all .\nIt is worth keeping in mind that the fabulous goose was slaughtered not in spite of the golden eggs but because of them . Politicians are covetous . When the owners of Apple wish to hold on to their own after-tax earnings , they are denounced as greedy . ( Apple \u2019 s shareholders are corporately the largest taxpayer in the world . ) When Elizabeth Warren wants to seize those earnings for her own use , what is that ? It is covetousness , which is what you get when you have greed compounded with envy . Senator Warren , a former Sunday-school teacher , apparently has a keen appreciation for the vices that lurk in the human heart , and she intends to leverage them to her benefit .\nAnother thing about these kinds of proposals : They are , at heart , acts of cowardice . There are politicians who wish to provide benefits to certain constituents and who would like those benefits to be paid for by other parties who are politically disfavored . There is an easy way to do that : Tax x to subsidize y . The problem with doing that is embarrassment . Politicians such as Senator Warren lack the courage to go to the American electorate and say : \u201c We wish to provide these benefits , and they will cost an extra $ 3 trillion a year , which we will pay for by doubling taxes. \u201d Why spend the money to subsidize , say , health insurance , when you can just pass rules that make businesses do the subsidizing for you ? It \u2019 s a way to spend money without putting the expenditures on a budget line . It treats the productive capacity of the United States as a herd of dairy cows to be milked by Senator Warren et al . at their convenience . And , of course , Senator Warren and her colleagues get to decide how the milk gets distributed , too .\nIt is a fairly easy thing for an established American business to move its corporate domicile to some other country , as with all those corporate inversions in the pharmaceutical industry that gave the Obama administration the willies a few years ago . It is also a fairly easy thing for a new business being founded by Americans to incorporate in some other country from the beginning . There is no insurmountable reason for , say , Microsoft or Altria ( formerly Philip Morris ) to be domiciled in the United States . Silicon Valley \u2019 s competitive edge comes from people , and people are mobile .\nNearly half of the total sales of the S & P 500 businesses come from overseas customers . Many big U.S. manufacturers such as Caterpillar get more than half of their sales from abroad . Exxon , the target of a political jihad being conducted by Senator Warren \u2019 s party , gets more than half of its revenue from overseas sales . You can serve the growing Asian markets as easily from Singapore as from California or Virginia .

But if American law or American lawmakers are going to treat profit-seeking enterprises as an Enemy of the People \u2014 Zurich is pretty nice . Lots of places are .

Children are not required to show ID . Remove all items from your pockets , including your wallet . Take off your belt , bulky jewelry , money , keys and cellphone . Remove shoes and place them directly on the belt . Children under 12 do not have to take off their shoes or light outerwear jackets . Remove animals from their carrying cases and send the case through the X-ray machine . Hold your pet in your arms and proceed through the metal detector . All liquids , gels and aerosols must be in 3.4-ounce ( 100-ml ) or smaller containers , and packed in a 1-quart , clear plastic , zip-top baggie . Each passenger can take one zip-top bag in his or her carry-on . This is the 3-1-1 rule . Medically necessary liquids and gels \u2014 including medications , baby formula and food , breast milk and juice \u2014 are allowed in reasonable quantities above the 3.4 ounce limit . These liquids are not required to be in zip-top bags . Let a TSA officer know you are carrying these items . They may be screened . Put any items in the stroller pockets or baskets in a carry-on bag and place it on the X-ray belt for inspection .

''\nTSA spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein says last fall , the agency began to reduce \u2014 though not eliminate \u2014 the number of pat-downs for kids .\nIf they set off an alarm , kids can now go through the metal detectors more than once . If they continue to set off alarms , instead of getting a pat-down , they 'll be swabbed \u2014 usually on their hands . The swab then goes into a machine to check for explosive residue .\nPat-downs are among the top five complaints the TSA received last year .\n`` One of the things that is going to be met with much happiness , from the parents anyway , is that passengers who are 12 and under no longer need to take off their shoes , '' Farbstein says .\nShe says there 's a reason agents screen kids and their belongings .

Once on the plane , the parent could have reassembled the handgun if TSA officers did not screen the child 's toy .\nAmy Selco is a mother of two boys in Silver Spring , Md . She says the new rule allowing her sons to keep their shoes on has been very popular with her family .\n`` The first time my son had to take off his shoes , he flipped out , '' Selco says . `` I mean , that 's kind of a violation . He was in this new environment anyway . And he screamed and he cried . ''\nMonika Sakala , a mother of two young girls , writes about her experiences for her blog , Wired Momma .

It 's their nightmare . ''\nShe says she 's surprised when people do n't offer to help a parent traveling alone with their kids . Families have to think about a lot of things other passengers do n't : packing strollers , car seats , baby formula , diapers , snacks and entertainment for their unpredictable kids .\nWilliam Clark , a relatively recent parent , says becoming a father has changed his perspective .\n`` I 'm always just worried about other passengers . Sometimes they 're in a bad mood , '' Clark says . `` I remember when I did n't have kids , being disturbed by a kid kicking the back of my seat . Now I 'm much more understanding .

( Jeenah Moon/Reuters )\nThe hot protest slogan and hashtag of the moment is \u201c Defund the Police. \u201d At times , it \u2019 s also framed as a call to abolish or disband the police . Ordinary speakers of the English language would naturally assume , listening to people chant \u201c defund the police \u201d in the streets , carry \u201c defund the police \u201d signs , and literally paint \u201c defund the police \u201d on the streets of D.C. , that such people mean \u201c defund the police . \u201d\nBut not our media ! There \u2019 s been an immediate rush to write pieces explaining that , of course , \u201c defund the police \u201d does not actually mean \u201c defund the police. \u201d From a Washington Post op-ed by Georgetown Law professor Christy Lopez , entitled \u201c Defund the police ? Here \u2019 s what that really means \u201d :\nBe not afraid . \u201c Defunding the police \u201d is not as scary ( or even as radical ) as it sounds . . . Defunding and abolition probably mean something different from what you are thinking . For most proponents , \u201c defunding the police \u201d does not mean zeroing out budgets for public safety , and police abolition does not mean that police will disappear overnight \u2014 or perhaps ever .\nFrom an Associated Press explainer by Michael Balsamo , Zeke Miller , and Michael Sisak entitled \u201c When protesters cry \u2018 defund the police , \u2019 what does it mean ? \u201d :\nBut what does \u2018 defund the police \u2019 mean ? It \u2019 s not necessarily about gutting police department budgets . . . . Supporters say it isn \u2019 t about eliminating police departments or stripping agencies of all of their money .\nFrom Matt Yglesias at Vox , \u201c Growing calls to \u201c defund the police , \u201d explained \u201d :\nThe basic idea , though , is less that policing budgets should be literally zeroed out than that there should be a massive restructuring of public spending priorities . . . . Police abolitionists are proposing a scaling-back of the scope of police activities that is far outside the horizon of current political possibility , so they may not articulate the most fine-grained details .\nFrom Emily VanDerWerff at Vox , \u201c The narrative power of \u2018 abolish the police \u2019 : It isn \u2019 t just a policy proposal . It \u2019 s also an idea of what the country could be \u201d :\nApplying these storytelling rules to the political realm shifts the introduction of the main character and the goal \u2014 the first act , in other words . Different sides advance different ideas of what goal should be accomplished ( in this case , police reform ) , and which protagonist should be at the forefront ( in this case , a broad sociopolitical movement often defined by key individuals ) . The audience ( in this case , the American public ) ultimately chooses which story it most wants to hear\u2026 So it is with \u201c abolish the police. \u201d Here , the \u201c protagonist \u201d is a combination of over-policed black communities and the protesters who have rallied to those communities \u2019 side in the last few weeks , and the goal is to dismantle the de facto police state those communities live in . Setting goals versus proposing solutions is a big divide in how people on the left talk about politics\u2026\nThere \u2019 s been much more in this vein , but you get the idea . Notably , articles of this nature seek to draw the eye towards legislative and think-tank proposals and away from the voices of the people actually chanting in the streets .\nIn part , of course , all this explaining is a reflection of what a radical and politically explosive idea \u201c defund the police \u201d is in an election year , and how it divides the Democrats along ideological and generational lines . Leading Democratic politicians are running headlong away from the slogan while trying to embrace the people chanting it . Joe Biden , who for years proudly touted his role in the 1994 \u201c put 100,000 more cops on the street \u201d crime bill , visibly wants no part of the slogan . But unlike the party \u2019 s leadership , many of whom were born in the early 1940s , influential younger lawmakers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are pushing the idea . These are the folks who may run the party when the age-77-and-up crowd moves on .\nDefunding police is also wildly impractical . The Minneapolis City Council grabbed headlines by voting to defund and disband the city \u2019 s police department , but they don \u2019 t actually have the legal authority to do that ; defunding would require a revision to the city charter , which the voters would have to approve . Until then , the cops report to the city \u2019 s mayor , not the city council . Camden , New Jersey actually went forward with disbanding its police department \u2014 in theory . In practice , what Camden did is just old-fashioned union-busting : disband the department to get rid of the union , then hire the same cops back at lower salaries and benefits .\nWhat makes the media \u2019 s Voxsplaining of \u201c Defund the Police \u201d all so astonishingly brazen is when you compare it with how they routinely treat popular slogans , protests , and broad-brush assertions by politicians on the right . When Tea Party protesters and Republican politicians called for repealing Obamacare , for example , they were roundly mocked in these same quarters for not having a single , comprehensive , CBO-scored plan on which the entire party agreed , notwithstanding the presence of plenty of think-tank proposals and general agreement on a lot of individual pieces . A whole cottage industry exists to lampoon protestors on the right for not fully grasping the nuances of their own slogans . When Tom Cotton wrote an op-ed that the New York Times titled , \u201c Send in the Troops , \u201d it was widely treated as a call to sic troops on peaceful protestors even though Cotton explicitly said otherwise in the op-ed . Conservative politicians and pundits are assumed to be responsible for the literal content of \u201c abolish the IRS , \u201d or \u201c close the border , \u201d or \u201c build the wall. \u201d Liberal media commentators spent years mocking Salena Zito \u2019 s description of Trump supporters who \u201c take him seriously , but not literally \u201d \u2014 which is precisely what these same voices are now trying to do with \u201c defund the police . \u201d\nAs always with these sorts of double standards : They think we can \u2019 t see what they are doing .", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans and Democrats reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday on a two-year bill to finance highways , ending a partisan stalemate that had left transit projects under a cloud of uncertainty .\nThe bill , which would provide $ 8.4 billion each year , is similar to a bipartisan measure passed by the Senate earlier this year . House Republicans worked on their own ambitious and unwieldy bill that never even made it to the floor for a vote .\nIn the agreement on Wednesday , House Republicans gave up on two key points : a provision that would have sped up the authorization of the Keystone XL pipeline and another that would have loosened restrictions on coal ash from power plants .\nThe new bill would reduce the average time it takes to complete a highway project by streamlining administrative processes and consolidating a variety of programs , as Republicans desired . \u201c That was one of the things we insisted on , \u201d said Representative John Mica of Florida , chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .\nThe bill is almost certain to rile groups that are concerned with sustaining projects that have received money in the past . For instance , the measure now permits states to opt out of federal mandates that required them to spend highway money on programs like beautification and bike paths .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .

This bill would have halted the president \u2019 s emergency declaration to funnel $ 3.6 billion in Defense Department funding to build more sections of his wall at the Southern border ; the bill the president vetoed last night was nearly identical . \u201c In short , the situation on our southern border remains a national emergency , and our Armed Forces are still needed to help confront it , \u201d Trump wrote in his message to the Senate Tuesday just after 9 p.m. , an hour into the Democratic debate . Congress could override the President \u2019 s veto with a two-thirds majority of votes in the Senate , but that is unlikely to occur , the New York Times reports .\nBuilding a wall at the southern border has long been a drawn-out battle at the center of Trump \u2019 s aggressive and contentious crackdown on immigration reform . And Democrats have fought tooth and nail throughout Trump \u2019 s presidency to block his efforts to succeed in that plan , as well as to put a halt to his detention of refugees and his controversial family separation policy .\nBut during Tuesday \u2019 s three-hour Democratic presidential debate , there wasn \u2019 t a single question about immigration . Even some of the candidates later expressed disappointment with how this subject , as well as ones on climate change and LBGTQ , were not part of the discussion .\nThree hours . Not one question about the climate crisis . Not one question about LGBTQ+ rights . Not one question about immigration . These issues are too important to ignore . # DemDebate \u2014 Kamala Harris ( @ KamalaHarris ) October 16 , 2019", "Next week , North Dakota voters will decide whether to add an amendment to the state 's constitution that supporters say will guarantee religious freedom . But the ballot measure has prompted debate over precisely what it safeguards ; opponents argue that it 's a solution in search of a problem and worry about its consequences .\nMeasure 3 is worded this way : `` Government may not burden a person 's or religious organization 's religious liberty . '' Its supporters call it the Religious Liberty Restoration amendment ; they say it 's needed because of a 22-year-old U.S. Supreme Court decision they believe has put limits on religious freedom .\n`` What this amendment is attempting to do is to restore that level of protection to what it was pre-1990 , '' says Tom Freier , who heads the North Dakota Family Alliance . The group led the effort to put the measure on the ballot .\nFreier says that making Measure 3 part of the constitution would give it permanence and help prevent attacks on religious freedom .\n`` So , the analogy would be : We live in Fargo , and most recently in Bismarck and in Minot , you 've had floods . And you want to prepare for that . You do n't know exactly when or how things are going to happen , but you want to make preparation , '' he says . `` This measure would really put in place the protection for North Dakota that would make sure that people are protected , and religious organizations are protected , when and if they do need that protection . ''\nBut the measure 's opponents worry about unintended consequences . They say it could allow parents who abuse children to hide behind the curtain of religious liberty . One opponent is Tim Hathaway , executive director of Prevent Child Abuse North Dakota .\n`` We are urging a 'no ' vote on Measure 3 , '' he says , `` because it will seriously undercut protection for children in our state by opening the door for people to claim religious freedom as a justification for maltreatment . ''\nRenee Stromme of the North Dakota Women 's Network agrees , saying if it passes , Measure 3 could also lead to discrimination .\n`` An employer could use religious beliefs to fire a pregnant woman because she is unmarried , '' Stromme says . `` So let 's think that through : We now have a single mother , unemployed , struggling to make ends meet , to care for the welfare of her family \u2014 and her employer would have a protected defense for his action . And a judge would have to determine otherwise . ''\nBut Measure 3 supporters like Christopher Dodson , who heads the North Dakota Catholic Conference , say those claims are unfounded .\n`` The measure itself says that it does n't affect those acts which the state has a compelling interest in preventing , '' he says . `` And it 's somewhat irresponsible to even imply that the state does n't have an interest in protecting children , women and vulnerable persons . ''\nNorth Dakota 's Legislative Council , the state Legislature 's research arm , agrees with that assessment . Still , opponents argue the measure is both unnecessary and potentially dangerous \u2014 and could raise new ways for people to define their own extreme religious views .\nGladys Cairns , the former administrator of North Dakota Child Protective Services , says she worries that criminals will hide behind a religious cloak .\n`` If I were a defense attorney , I 'd be making sure that my client would be doing that , '' she says .\nRecent polls point to a close vote . Both sides are running a number of radio and television ads between now and the June 12 election .", "US Congresswomen have protested for the right to bare arms in parts of Washington DC 's Capitol building .\nThe National Rifle Association may be disappointed to learn that this is not a typo . They are not campaigning to bear weapons , but to stand against the Congressional dress code .\nThe protest comes after a number of women have recently reported being told their outfits violated the rules .\nFemale reporters have said they had been prevented from entering the lobby area , where the press meets to ask questions of US politicians .\nOn Friday , Representative Jackie Speier tweeted to encourage colleagues to dress in clothes that showed their arms , calling the protest `` Sleeveless Friday '' .\nA group of around 25 women gathered on the steps of Congress , wearing sleeveless shirts and dresses .\n`` It 's 2017 and women vote , hold office , and choose their own style . Time to update House Rules to reflect the times ! '' tweeted Congress member Chellie Pingree .\nAlthough the rules are long-standing , they are rarely enforced , and so those affected recently expressed surprise .\nNews network CBS said one reporter tried to fashion makeshift sleeves out of her notebook so she would be able to work .\nThe sleeves rule also applies to men , who are required to wear suit jackets and ties to enter the same areas .\nPolicing of the rules is left to the chamber 's security team , under the guidance of the house speaker .\nAfter a backlash , House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasised that the code had not been devised under his term , and agreed it needs to be modernised .\n`` It came to my attention that there was an issue about dress code , '' he said in a press conference on Thursday morning , with a laugh .\nSpeaker Ryan said , earlier in June , that members should wear `` appropriate business attire '' .\nIn the UK , a similar debate recently erupted when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was happy to relax the rules .\nIn June , he accepted a question from a member of parliament who was not wearing a tie .\nYet what this constitutes in 2017 - especially with the rise of more casual media and tech companies - is not always clear .", "Controversy and the government shutdown greeted marchers who gathered in the Washington cold Saturday for the third annual national Women \u2019 s March .\nThe event , which kicked off near Freedom Plaza blocks from the White House , drew thousands , a number far fewer than the hundreds of thousands who descended on the National Mall for the first Women \u2019 s March , the day after Donald Trump \u2019 s inauguration in 2017 .\nA National Park permit issued Thursday anticipated a crowd of 10,000 , The Washington Post reported . Weeks ago organizers anticipated a crowd of several hundred thousand in a permit application .\nWASSERMAN SCHULTZ OPTS OUT OF WOMEN 'S MARCH : ' I CAN NOT STAND ALONGSIDE IT '\nSister marches in other cities included one in New York City . Bronx Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke at that march . She was also expected to attend a separate \u201c Women \u2019 s Unity Rally \u201d in downtown Manhattan .\n\u201c Last year we brought the power to the polls , and this year we need to make sure that we translate that power into policy , \u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the New York Women 's March in Columbus Circle . \u201c That means we will not let anyone take our rights away - in fact we will expand them . \u201d\nShe told the crowd it also meant working to pass an Equal Rights Amendment .\nThis year \u2019 s Women \u2019 s March has been hurt by accusations of anti-Semitism that have trailed the group \u2019 s organizers . Two of them , Linda Sarsour , a Palestinian activist who has embraced the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement , and co-President Tamika Mallory , have been criticized over their ties to Nation of Islam firebrand Louis Farrakhan .\nMallory refused recently to condemn Farrakhan for incendiary remarks about Jews during a speech in February that she attended .\nAs a result , the Democratic National Committee bowed out as a Women \u2019 s March sponsor .\nThe original plan for Saturday called for gathering on the National Mall , but with snow and freezing rain in the forecast and the National Park Service no longer plowing the snow because of the shutdown , the march \u2019 s location and route was altered this week to start at Freedom Plaza and march down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Trump International Hotel .\nNear Freedom Plaza , protesters carried singed that were playful and pointed , including \u201c Wonder Woman in a pink pussy hat , \u201d \u201c Our Rights Are Real , \u201d and \u201c Protect Women , \u201d according to the Post .\nA small group of counter-protesters , surrounded by D.C. police , marched toward Trump International Hotel with signs that said \u201c America you need to bless God , \u201d \u201c Abortion is murder \u201d and \u201c Islam is a religion of blood and murder , \u201d the paper reported .\nShannon Lydon , a recent Boston College grad , told NBC News that she was excited to be attending the Women \u2019 s March in Washington .\n`` It \u2019 s such a movement , and it \u2019 s so empowering to be around so many people who are celebrating women and fighting for change , '' she said .", "Some of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape , heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes . Once upon a time rape was even a capital crime , like murder . Many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it .\nThe mere accusation of rape , like the accusation of molesting children , was usually horrific enough to guarantee conviction . Would a woman lie ? Some men accused of rape died at the hands of a mob and many at the hands of the state and were often not actually guilty .\nRape was serious , dreadful business then . But now , sometimes , not so much .\nAnger , unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women \u2014 abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better ( and probably do ) \u2014 to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another .\nOne young woman , Lena Dunham , has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped , or at least she thinks she was . She wrote a book about it .\nInnocent reputations suffer . Institutions are damaged when , like men , they pay for crimes that did not exist . Bearing false witness is a crime , too , and a serious one , legally no less than morally .\nRolling Stone magazine , the journal of rock music that sometimes aspires to big-boy journalism , is the current cause celebre , out with a sensational story of gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia . Colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently . The University of Alabama is celebrated as the nation \u2019 s foremost football factory . Georgetown is famous for having educated Bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in Washington . And now Tom Jefferson \u2019 s university has become , fair or not , a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education . Rolling Stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere .\nThe story in the magazine was a horrific one , more a tale from an Arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an American university town . A young women , identified by Rolling Stone only as \u201c Jackie , \u201d said she went to a party in a fraternity house in Charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians , raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help . The details were set down in a story by one Sabrina Rubin Erdely in Rolling Stone .\n\u201c Jackie \u201d provided neither corroborating evidence , and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details . Her story was told in the usual purple ink , as evidence of the \u201c rape epidemic \u201d said to be roiling campuses everywhere . \u201c Who would lie about rape ? \u201d\nWhen her story began unravel , as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story , Rolling Stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story . Feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation ; \u201c rape denial , \u201d said one , \u201c is like denying the Holocaust. \u201d Maybe nothing happened , but it could have . Isn \u2019 t that enough ?\nRolling Stone \u2019 s only defense was an apology , subject to revision , which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers . The apologies , such as they were , suggested that the university \u2019 s \u201c troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults \u201d was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism . Newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less .\n\u201c Because of the sensitive nature of Jackie \u2019 s story , \u201d wrote Will Dana , the managing editor , \u201c we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack , for fear of retaliation against her. \u201d Facts have destroyed many a good story , and the magazine didn \u2019 t want that to happen to its account of Jackie \u2019 s lurid tale .\n\u201c In the face of new information , \u201d the apology continued , \u201c there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie \u2019 s account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t Rolling Stone \u2019 s fault , it was Jackie \u2019 s . \u201c We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t Rolling Stone \u2019 s fault that it sold fiction as fact , it was society \u2019 s fault . Lawyers are now on the scout for an identifiable plaintiff against the Stone .\n\u2022 Wesley Pruden is editor emeritus of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 ."], "queries": ["find a news article from the left
